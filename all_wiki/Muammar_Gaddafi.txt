He governed [[Libya]] as Revolutionary Chairman of the [[Libyan Arab Republic]] from 1969 to 1977 and then as the "[[Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution|Brotherly Leader]]" of the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Arab socialism]] but later ruled according to his own [[Third International Theory]].

<!--Early life and the republic--> 
Born near [[Sirte]], [[Italian Libya]], to a poor [[Bedouin]] family, Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], later enrolling in the [[Benghazi Military University Academy|Royal Military Academy, Benghazi]]. Within the military, he founded a revolutionary group which deposed the Western-backed [[Senussi]] monarchy of [[Idris of Libya|Idris]] in a [[1969 Libyan coup d'état|1969 coup]]. Having taken power, Gaddafi converted Libya into a republic governed by his [[Libyan Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]]. [[Rule by decree|Ruling by decree]], he deported Libya's [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italian]] and [[History of the Jews in Libya|Jewish]] population and ejected its Western military bases. Strengthening ties to Arab nationalist governments—particularly [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s Egypt—he unsuccessfully advocated [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab political union]]. An [[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernist]], he introduced ''[[sharia]]'' as the basis for the legal system and promoted "[[Islamic socialism]]". He nationalized the oil industry and used the increasing state revenues to bolster the military, fund foreign revolutionaries, and implement social programs emphasizing house-building, healthcare and education projects. In 1973, he initiated a "[[People's Revolution (Libya)|Popular Revolution]]" with the formation of [[Basic People's Congress (political)|Basic People's Congresses]], presented as a system of [[direct democracy]], but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year in ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]''.

<!--Jamahiriya and downfall-->
Gaddafi transformed Libya into a new [[socialist state]] called a ''[[Jamahiriya]]'' ("state of the masses") in 1977. He officially adopted a symbolic role in governance but remained head of both the military and the Revolutionary Committees responsible for policing and suppressing dissent. During the 1970s and 1980s, Libya's unsuccessful border conflicts with [[Libyan–Egyptian War|Egypt]] and [[Chadian–Libyan conflict|Chad]], support for foreign militants, and alleged responsibility for the [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bombing]] in Scotland left it increasingly isolated on the world stage. A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel, resulting in the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|1986 US bombing of Libya]] and [[United Nations]]–imposed [[economic sanctions]]. From 1999, Gaddafi shunned pan-Arabism and encouraged rapprochement with [[Western world|Western nations]] and [[pan-Africanism]]; he was [[Chairperson of the African Union]] from 2009 to 2010. Amid the 2011 [[Arab Spring]], protests against widespread corruption and unemployment broke out in eastern Libya. The situation descended into [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|civil war]], in which [[NATO]] [[2011 military intervention in Libya|intervened militarily]] on the side of the anti-Gaddafist [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC). The government was overthrown, and Gaddafi retreated to Sirte, only to be [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|captured and killed]] by NTC militants.

<!--Legacy and assessment:-->
A highly divisive figure, Gaddafi dominated Libya's politics for four decades and was the subject of a pervasive [[cult of personality]]. He was decorated with various awards and praised for his [[anti-imperialist]] stance, support for Arab—and then African—unity, and for significant improvements that his government brought to the Libyan people's quality of life. Conversely, many Libyans strongly opposed his social and economic reforms, and he was posthumously accused of sexual abuse. He was condemned by many as a dictator whose authoritarian administration violated [[Human rights in Libya|human rights]] and financed global [[terrorism]].

Along with other nomadic [[Bedouin]]s, the family were illiterate and kept no birth records.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=35|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=9|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=135}} Many biographers have used 7 June, however his birthday is not known with certainty and sources have set it in 1942 or the spring of 1943,{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=35|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=9|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=135}} although his biographers [[David Blundy]] and [[Andrew Lycett]] noted that it could have been pre-1940.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=35}} His parents' only surviving son, he had three older sisters.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=35|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=9|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=135}} Gaddafi's upbringing in Bedouin culture influenced his personal tastes for the rest of his life; he preferred the desert over the city and would retreat there to meditate.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=9|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=135}}

From childhood, Gaddafi was aware of the involvement of European colonial powers in Libya; his nation was [[Italian Libya|occupied by Italy]], and during the [[North African Campaign]] of the [[Second World War]] it witnessed conflict between Italian and British forces.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=35–37|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=135}} According to later claims, Gaddafi's paternal grandfather, Abdessalam Bouminyar, was killed by the Italian Army during the [[Italo-Turkish War|Italian invasion of 1911]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bianco|1y=1975|1p=4|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=37|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=4}} At the end of the Second World War in 1945, Libya was occupied by British and French forces. Britain and France considered dividing the nation between their empires, but the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] (UN) decided that the country was to be granted political independence,{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=38–39|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2pp=7–9, 14|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=108}} and in 1951 created the [[United Kingdom of Libya]], a federal state under the leadership of a pro-Western monarch, [[Idris of Libya|Idris]], who banned political parties and centralized power in his own hands.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=38–39|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2pp=7–9, 14|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=108}}

===Education and political activism: 1950–1963===

Gaddafi's earliest education was of a religious nature, imparted by a local Islamic teacher.{{sfnm|1a1=Bianco|1y=1975|1p=5|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2pp=135–136}} Subsequently, moving to nearby Sirte to attend elementary school, he progressed through six grades in four years.{{sfnm|1a1=Bianco|1y=1975|1pp=5–6, 8–9|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=39|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=10|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=136}} Education in Libya was not free, but his father thought it would greatly benefit his son despite the financial strain. During the week Gaddafi slept in a mosque, and at weekends walked 20 miles to visit his parents.{{sfnm|1a1=Bianco|1y=1975|1pp=5–6, 8–9|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=39|3a1=Simons|3y=1996|3p=170|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4p=10|5a1=St. John|5y=2012|5p=136}} At school, Gaddafi was bullied for being a Bedouin, but was proud of his identity and encouraged pride in other Bedouin children.{{sfnm|1a1=Bianco|1y=1975|1pp=5–6, 8–9|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=39|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=10|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=136}} From Sirte, he and his family moved to the market town of [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]] in [[Fezzan]], south-central Libya, where his father worked as a caretaker for a tribal leader while Muammar attended secondary school, something neither parent had done.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=39|2a1=Simons|2y=1996|2pp=170–171|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3pp=10–11|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=136}} Gaddafi was popular at this school; some friends made there received significant jobs in his later administration, most notably his best friend, [[Abdessalam Jalloud|Abdul Salam Jalloud]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=58|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=39–40|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=11}}

[[File:Nasser portrait2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Egyptian [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|President Nasser]] was Gaddafi's political hero.]]

Many teachers at Sabha were Egyptian, and for the first time, Gaddafi had access to pan-Arab newspapers and radio broadcasts, especially the [[Cairo]]-based ''[[Voice of the Arabs]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=58|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=40|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3pp=11–12|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=136}} Growing up, Gaddafi witnessed significant events rock the [[Arab world]], including the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, and the short-lived existence of the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR) between 1958 and 1961.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=136}} Gaddafi admired the political changes implemented in the [[Arab Republic of Egypt]] under his hero, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. Nasser argued for [[Arab nationalism]]; the rejection of Western [[colonialism]], [[neo-colonialism]], and [[Zionism]]; and a transition from [[capitalism]] to [[socialism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=40|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2p=10|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3pp=11–12|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=136}} Gaddafi was influenced by Nasser's book, ''Philosophy of the Revolution'', which outlined how to initiate a coup.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=40|2a1=Simons|2y=1996|2p=171}} One of Gaddafi's Egyptian teachers, Mahmoud Efay, was reportedly sympathetic towards the youth's political ideas, and advised him that a successful revolution would need the support of the army.{{sfn|Simons|1996|p=171}}

Gaddafi organized demonstrations and distributed posters criticizing the monarchy.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=42–43|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2pp=11–12|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=136}} In October 1961, he led a demonstration protesting against Syria's secession from the UAR, and raised funds to send cables of support to Nasser. Twenty students were arrested as a result of the disorder. Gaddafi and his companions also broke windows in a local hotel that was [[Islamic dietary laws#Intoxicants|accused of serving alcohol]]. To punish Gaddafi, the authorities expelled him and his family from Sabha.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=58|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=42–43|3a1=Simons|3y=1996|3pp=171–172|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4p=11|5a1=St. John|5y=2012|5p=136}} Gaddafi moved to [[Misrata]], there attending Misrata Secondary School.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=58|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=44|3a1=Simons|3y=1996|3p=172|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4pp=11|5a1=St. John|5y=2012|5p=137}} Maintaining his interest in Arab nationalist activism, he refused to join any of the banned political parties active in the city—including the [[Arab Nationalist Movement]], the [[Libyan Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]], and the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]—claiming that he rejected factionalism.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=137}} He read voraciously on the subjects of Nasser and the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, as well as the works of the Syrian political theorist [[Michel Aflaq]] and biographies of [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Sun Yat-sen]], and [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]].{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=137}}

===Military training: 1963–1966===
Gaddafi briefly studied history at the [[University of Libya]] in [[Benghazi]] before dropping out to join the military.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1pp=46–47|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=138}} Despite his police record, in 1963 he began training at the [[Benghazi Military University Academy|Royal Military Academy]], Benghazi, alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata. The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged Libyans, and Gaddafi recognized it as a potential instrument of political change.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=45|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2pp=12|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=138}} Under Idris, Libya's armed forces were trained by the British military; this angered Gaddafi, who viewed the British as imperialists, and accordingly, he refused to learn English and was rude to the British officers, ultimately failing his exams.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=45}} British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour, stating their suspicion that he was involved in the assassination of the military academy's commander in 1963. Such reports were ignored, and Gaddafi quickly progressed through the course.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=46, 48–49|2a1=Simons|2y=1996|2p=173}}

With a group of loyal cadres, in 1964 Gaddafi established the Central Committee of the Free Officers Movement, a revolutionary group named after Nasser's [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Egyptian predecessor]]. Led by Gaddafi, they met secretively and were organized into a [[clandestine cell system]], offering their salaries into a single fund.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=47–48|2a1=Simons|2y=1996|2p=173|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3pp=12–13}} Gaddafi travelled around Libya collecting intelligence and developing connections with sympathizers, but the government's intelligence services ignored him, considering him little threat.{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|p=13}} Graduating in August 1965,{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=138}} Gaddafi became a communications officer in the army's signal corps.{{sfnm|1a1=Simons|1y=1996|1p=174|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=138}}

In April 1966, he was assigned to the United Kingdom for further training; over nine months he underwent an English-language course at [[Beaconsfield]], Buckinghamshire, an [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] signal instructors course in [[Bovington Camp]], Dorset, and an infantry signal instructors course at [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]], Kent.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=49–50|2a1=Simons|2y=1996|2p=174|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=13|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=138}} Despite later rumours to the contrary, he did not attend the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|p=13}} The Bovington signal course's director reported that Gaddafi successfully overcame problems learning English, displaying a firm command of voice procedure. Noting that Gaddafi's favourite hobbies were reading and playing [[association football|football]], he thought him an "amusing officer, always cheerful, hard-working, and conscientious".{{sfn|St. John|2012|pp=138–139}} Gaddafi disliked England, saying [[British Army]] officers racially insulted him and finding it difficult adjusting to the country's culture; asserting his Arab identity in London, he walked around [[Piccadilly]] wearing traditional Libyan robes.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=49–50|2a1=Simons|2y=1996|2p=174|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=13|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=139}} He later related that while he travelled to England believing it more advanced than Libya, he returned home "more confident and proud of our values, ideals and social character".{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=49–50|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=13|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=139}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=People of Libya! In response to your own will, fulfilling your most heartfelt wishes, answering your most incessant demands for change and regeneration, and your longing to strive towards these ends: listening to your incitement to rebel, your armed forces have undertaken the overthrow of the corrupt regime, the stench of which has sickened and horrified us all. At a single blow our gallant army has toppled these idols and has destroyed their images. By a single stroke it has lightened the long dark night in which the Turkish domination was followed first by Italian rule, then by this reactionary and decadent regime which was no more than a hotbed of extortion, faction, treachery and treason.|salign=right |source=—Gaddafi's radio speech after seizing power, 1969{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Simons|2y=1996|2pp=178–179}} }}

Idris' government was increasingly unpopular by the latter 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by [[unitary state|centralizing]] the country's [[federalism|federal system]] to take advantage of the country's oil wealth.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=52|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3pp=15–16}} Corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=51|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=136}} Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the [[Six-Day War]] with Israel; Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli due to its alliance with the Western powers.{{sfnm|1a1=Simons|1y=1996|1p=175|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2006|2p=70|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3pp=16–17}} Anti-Western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt.{{sfnm|1a1=Simons|1y=1996|1p=175|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2006|2p=70|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3pp=16–17}} By 1969, the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup. Although claims have been made that they knew of Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement, they have since claimed ignorance, stating that they were instead monitoring Abdul Aziz Shalhi's Black Boots revolutionary group.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=53|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=19|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3pp=139–140}}

In mid-1969, Idris travelled abroad to spend the summer in Turkey and Greece. Gaddafi's Free Officers recognized this as their chance to overthrow the monarchy, initiating "Operation Jerusalem".{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=18}} On 1 September, they occupied airports, police depots, radio stations, and government offices in Tripoli and Benghazi. Gaddafi took control of the Berka barracks in Benghazi, while Omar Meheishi occupied Tripoli barracks and Jalloud seized the city's anti-aircraft batteries. Khweldi Hameidi was sent to arrest crown prince [[Hasan as-Senussi|Sayyid Hasan ar-Rida al-Mahdi as-Sanussi]] and force him to relinquish his claim to the throne.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=57–59|3a1=Simons|3y=1996|3pp=177–178|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4p=18}} They met no serious resistance and wielded little violence against the monarchists.{{sfnm|1a1=Simons|1y=1996|1p=178|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=18}}

Once Gaddafi removed the monarchical government, he announced the foundation of the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libyan Arab Republic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=55|2a1=Harris|2y=1986|2p=15|3a1=Simons|3y=1996|3p=179}} Addressing the populace by radio, he proclaimed an end to the "reactionary and corrupt" regime, "the stench of which has sickened and horrified us all".{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Harris|2y=1986|2p=14|3a1=Blundy|3a2=Lycett|3y=1987|3pp=59–60|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4p=18}} Due to the coup's bloodless nature, it was initially labelled the "White Revolution", although was later renamed the "One September Revolution" after the date on which it occurred.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=134}} Gaddafi insisted that the Free Officers' coup represented a revolution, marking the start of widespread change in the socio-economic and political nature of Libya.{{sfnm|1a1=St. John|1y=1983|1p=472|2a1=Bearman|2y=1986|2p=56|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=159}} He proclaimed that the revolution meant "freedom, socialism, and unity", and over the coming years implemented measures to achieve this.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=62|2a1=Harris|2y=1986|2p=15|3a1=Blundy|3a2=Lycett|3y=1987|3p=64|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=148}}

===Consolidating leadership: 1969–1973===
The 12 member central committee of the Free Officers proclaimed themselves the [[Libyan Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]] (RCC), the government of the new republic.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=63|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2p=9|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=134}} Lieutenant Gaddafi became RCC chairman, and therefore the ''de facto'' head of state, also appointing himself to the rank of [[colonel]] and becoming commander-in-chief of the armed forces.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=15|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=64|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=134}} Jalloud became Prime Minister,{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=91–92}} while a civilian Council of Ministers headed by Sulaiman Maghribi was founded to implement RCC policy.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=17|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=63}} Libya's administrative capital was moved from [[Bayda, Libya|al-Beida]] to Tripoli.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=71}}

[[File:Flag of Libya (1969–1972).svg|thumb|left|The flag of republican Libya used by Gaddafi's government from 1969 to 1972]]

Although theoretically a collegial body operating through consensus building, Gaddafi dominated the RCC.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=134}} Some of the others attempted to constrain what they saw as his excesses.{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|p=20}} Gaddafi remained the government's public face, with the identities of the other RCC members only being publicly revealed on 10 January 1970.{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2006|1p=79|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2p=9|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=134}} All young men from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, none had university degrees; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy, highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=38|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2006|2p=79|3a1=Vandewalle|3y=2008b|3p=10|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4p=20}}

The coup completed, the RCC proceeded with their intentions of consolidating the revolutionary government and modernizing the country.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=134}} They purged monarchists and members of Idris' [[Senussi]] clan from Libya's political world and armed forces; Gaddafi believed this elite were opposed to the will of the Libyan people and had to be expunged.{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2008b|1p=11|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2pp=21–23}} "People's Courts" were founded to try various monarchist politicians and journalists, many of whom were imprisoned, although none executed. Idris was sentenced to execution ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=71|2a1=Harris|2y=1986|2p=16|3a1=Blundy|3a2=Lycett|3y=1987|3p=62}}

In May 1970, the Revolutionary Intellectuals Seminar was held to bring intellectuals in line with the revolution,{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=17}} while that year's Legislative Review and Amendment united secular and religious law codes, introducing ''[[sharia]]'' into the legal system.{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=16}}
[[Rule by decree|Ruling by decree]], the RCC maintained the monarchy's ban on political parties, in May 1970 banned trade unions, and in 1972 outlawed workers' strikes and suspended newspapers.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=17|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=63–64|3a1=Vandewalle|3y=2008b|3p=11|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=153}} In September 1971, Gaddafi resigned, claiming to be dissatisfied with the pace of reform, but returned to his position within a month.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=91–92}} In February 1973, he resigned again, once more returning the following month.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=85}}

====Economic and social reform====

Gaddafi sits in military uniform in the middle, surrounded by Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] (left) and Syrian President [[Nureddin al-Atassi]] (right).]]

The RCC's early economic policy has been characterized as being [[state capitalism|state capitalist]] in orientation.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=124}} Many schemes were established to aid entrepreneurs and develop a Libyan bourgeoisie.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=123}} Seeking to expand the cultivatable acreage in Libya, in September 1969 the government launched a "Green Revolution" to increase agricultural productivity so that Libya could rely less on imported food.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=128}} The hope was to make Libya self-sufficient in food production.{{sfn|El-Khawas|1984|p=34}} All land that had either been expropriated from Italian settlers or which was not in use was repossessed and redistributed.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=129}} Irrigation systems were established along the northern coastline and around various inland oases.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|pp=130–132}} Production costs often surpassed the value of the produce and thus Libyan agricultural production remained in deficit, relying heavily on state subsidies.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=132}}

With [[crude oil]] as the country's primary export, Gaddafi sought to improve Libya's oil sector.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=66–67|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2pp=145–146}} In October 1969, he proclaimed the current trade terms unfair, benefiting foreign corporations more than the Libyan state, and threatened to decrease production. In December Jalloud successfully increased the price of Libyan oil.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=80–88|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=66–67|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3pp=145–146}} In 1970, other [[OPEC]] states followed suit, leading to a global increase in the price of crude oil.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=66–67|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2pp=145–146}} The RCC followed with the Tripoli Agreement of 20 March 1971, in which they secured income tax, back-payments and better pricing from the oil corporations; these measures brought Libya an estimated $1&nbsp;billion in additional revenues in its first year.{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2008b|1p=15|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=147}}

Increasing state control over the oil sector, the RCC began a program of [[nationalization]], starting with the expropriation of [[BP|British Petroleum]]'s share of the British Petroleum-N.B. Hunt Sahir Field in December 1971.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=90|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=68|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=147}} In September 1973, it was announced that all foreign oil producers active in Libya were to see 51 per cent of their operation nationalized, including the stake of [[Nelson Bunker Hunt]], son of [[H.L. Hunt]], who had played a key role in the discovery of oil in Libya.<ref name="Libya">{{Cite book| last = Greenwood| first = C.

[[File:Sadat Qaddafi Assad 1971.jpg|thumb|left|250px|In 1971, Egypt's [[Anwar Sadat]], Libya's Gaddafi and Syria's [[Hafez al-Assad]] signed an agreement [[Federation of Arab Republics|to form a federal Union of Arab Republics]].

The RCC implemented measures for social reform, adopting ''sharia'' as a basis.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=64|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2p=31|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=21|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=134}} The consumption of alcohol was prohibited, night clubs and Christian churches were shut down, traditional Libyan dress was encouraged, and Arabic was decreed as the only language permitted in official communications and on road signs.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=72|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=64|3a1=Vandewalle|3y=2008b|3p=31|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4p=21|5a1=St. John|5y=2012|5p=134}} The RCC doubled the [[minimum wage]], introduced statutory price controls, and implemented compulsory rent reductions of between 30 and 40 per cent.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=73}} Gaddafi also wanted to combat the strict social restrictions that had been imposed on women by the previous regime, establishing the Revolutionary Women's Formation to encourage reform.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=196}} In 1970, a law was introduced affirming equality of the sexes and insisting on wage parity.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=198}} In 1971, Gaddafi sponsored the creation of a Libyan General Women's Federation.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=197}} In 1972, a law was passed criminalizing the marriage of any females under the age of sixteen and ensuring that a woman's consent was a necessary prerequisite for a marriage.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=198}} Gaddafi's regime opened up a wide range of educational and employment opportunities for women, although these primarily benefited a minority in the urban middle-classes.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=198}}

From 1969 to 1973, it used oil money to fund social welfare programs, which led to house-building projects and improved healthcare and education.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=149}} House building became a major social priority, designed to eliminate homelessness and to replace the [[shanty town]]s created by Libya's growing urbanization.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=73}} The health sector was also expanded; by 1978, Libya had 50 per cent more hospitals than it had in 1968, while the number of doctors had increased from 700 to over 3000 in that decade.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=74}} [[Malaria]] was eradicated, and [[trachoma]] and [[tuberculosis]] greatly curtailed.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=74}} Compulsory education was expanded from 6 to 9 years, while adult literacy programs and free university education were introduced.{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=38}} [[Beida University]] was founded, while [[Tripoli University]] and [[Benghazi University]] were expanded.{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=38}} In doing so, the government helped to integrate the poorer strata of Libyan society into the education system.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|pp=74–75}} Through these measures, the RCC greatly expanded the [[public sector]], providing employment for thousands.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=23|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=149}} These early social programs proved popular within Libya.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=19|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=22|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=149}} This popularity was partly due to Gaddafi's personal charisma, youth and underdog status as a Bedouin, as well as his rhetoric emphasizing his role as the successor to the anti-Italian fighter [[Omar Mukhtar]].{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2008b|1pp=31–32|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=22}}

To combat the country's strong regional and tribal divisions, the RCC promoted the idea of a unified pan-Libyan identity.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=154}} In doing so, they tried discrediting tribal leaders as agents of the old regime, and in August 1971 a Sabha military court tried many of them for counter-revolutionary activity.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=154}} Long-standing administrative boundaries were re-drawn, crossing tribal boundaries, while pro-revolutionary modernizers replaced traditional leaders, yet the communities they served often rejected them.{{sfn|St. John|2012|pp=154–155}} Realizing the failures of the modernizers, Gaddafi created the [[Libyan Arab Socialist Union|Arab Socialist Union]] (ASU) in June 1971, a mass mobilization [[vanguard party]] of which he was president.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=136–137|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=91|3a1=Vandewalle|3y=2006|3p=83|4a1=Vandewalle|4y=2008b|4p=11|5a1=St. John|5y=2012|5p=155}} The ASU recognized the RCC as its "Supreme Leading Authority", and was designed to further revolutionary enthusiasm throughout the country.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=91|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2p=11|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=155}} It remained heavily bureaucratic and failed to mobilize mass support in the way Gaddafi had envisioned.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=138}}

The influence of Nasser's Arab nationalism over the RCC was immediately apparent.{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2006|1pp=79–80|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2p=9|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=137}} The administration was instantly [[Diplomatic recognition|recognized]] by the neighbouring Arab nationalist regimes in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Sudan,{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=55|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=60|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=18}} with Egypt sending experts to aid the inexperienced RCC.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=62–63|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=18}} Gaddafi propounded [[pan-Arab]] ideas, proclaiming the need for a single Arab state stretching across North Africa and the Middle East.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=96|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=75|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=65|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=186}} In December 1969, Libya signed the Tripoli Charter alongside Egypt and Sudan. This established the Arab Revolutionary Front, a pan-national union designed as a first step towards the eventual political unification of the three nations.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=64|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=75|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=65|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=186}} In 1970 Syria declared its intention to join.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=96}}

Nasser died unexpectedly in September 1970, with Gaddafi playing a prominent role at his funeral.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=66}} Nasser was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]], who suggested that rather than creating a unified state, the Arab states should create [[Federation of Arab Republics|a political federation]], implemented in April 1971; in doing so, Egypt, Syria, and Sudan received large grants of Libyan oil money.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=97|2a1=Harris|2y=1986|2p=87|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=65|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4pp=151–152}} In February 1972, Gaddafi and Sadat signed an unofficial charter of merger, but it was never implemented because relations broke down the following year. Sadat became increasingly wary of Libya's radical direction, and the September 1973 deadline for implementing the Federation passed by with no action taken.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=66|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=182}}

After the 1969 coup, representatives of the [[Allied Control Council|Four Powers]]—France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the [[Soviet Union]]—were called to meet RCC representatives.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=140}} The UK and the US quickly extended diplomatic recognition, hoping to secure the position of their military bases in Libya and fearing further instability. Hoping to ingratiate themselves with Gaddafi, in 1970 the US informed him of at least one planned counter-coup.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=65|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=18|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3pp=140–141}} Such attempts to form a working relationship with the RCC failed; Gaddafi was determined to reassert national sovereignty and expunge what he described as foreign colonial and imperialist influences. His administration insisted that the US and the UK remove their military bases from Libya, with Gaddafi proclaiming that "the armed forces which rose to express the people's revolution [will not] tolerate living in their shacks while the bases of imperialism exist in Libyan territory." The British left in March and the Americans in June 1970.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=76–77|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=61|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=19|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4pp=141–143}}

Moving to reduce Italian influence, in October 1970 all Italian-owned assets were expropriated, and the 12,000-strong [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italian community]] was expelled from Libya alongside the smaller community of [[History of the Jews in Libya|Libyan Jews]]. The day became a [[Public holiday|national holiday]] known as "Vengeance Day".{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=72|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=64|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3pp=21–22|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=142}} Italy complained that this was in contravention of the 1956 Italo-Libyan Treaty, although no UN sanctions were forthcoming.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=72}} Aiming to reduce [[NATO]] power in the Mediterranean, in 1971 Libya requested that [[Malta]] cease allowing NATO to use its land for a military base, in turn offering Malta foreign aid.

[[File:Oil Rich Libya.ogv|thumb|left|250px|A 1972 anti-Gaddafist British [[newsreel]] including an interview with Gaddafi about his support for foreign militants]]

Gaddafi was especially critical of the US due to its support of Israel, and sided with the [[Palestinians]] in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], viewing the 1948 creation of the State of Israel as a Western colonial occupation forced upon the [[Arab world]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=70–71|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2p=34|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=64|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4pp=150–152}} He believed that Palestinian violence against Israeli and Western targets was the justified response of an oppressed people who were fighting against the colonization of their homeland.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=114}} Calling on the Arab states to wage "continuous war" against Israel, in 1970 he initiated a Jihad Fund to finance anti-Israeli militants.{{sfnm|1a1=St. John|1y=1983|1p=478|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=71|3a1=St. John|3y=1987|3p=36|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=185}} In June 1972 Gaddafi created the First Nasserite Volunteers Centre to train anti-Israeli guerrillas.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=37|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=151}}

Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian leader [[Yasser Arafat]] and his group, [[Fatah]], over more militant and [[Marxism|Marxist]] Palestinian groups.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=64–65|2a1=St. John|2y=1987|2p=37}} As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's relationship with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate and calling for more violent action.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=116|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=69–70|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=37|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=178}} Instead, he supported militias like the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command]], the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], [[As-Sa'iqa]], the [[Palestinian Popular Struggle Front]], and the [[Abu Nidal]] Organization.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=116|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=150|3a1=St. John|3y=2008|3p=95}} He funded the [[Black September Organization]] whose members perpetrated the 1972 [[Munich massacre]] of Israeli athletes in West Germany and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=114|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=78|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=38|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=178}}

Gaddafi financially supported other militant groups across the world, including the [[Black Panther Party]], the [[Nation of Islam]], the [[Tupamaros]], the [[19th of April Movement]] and the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] in Nicaragua, the [[African National Congress|ANC]] among other [[liberation movements]] in the fight against [[Apartheid]] in South Africa, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], [[Action directe (armed group)|Action directe]], the [[Red Brigades]], and the [[Red Army Faction]] in Europe, and the [[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia|Armenian Secret Army]], the [[Japanese Red Army]], the [[Free Aceh Movement]], and the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] in the [[Philippines]]. Gaddafi was indiscriminate in the causes which he funded, sometimes switching from supporting one side in a conflict to the other, as in the [[Eritrean War of Independence]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=78–81, 150, 185|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2pp=34–35, 40–53|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=151}} Throughout the 1970s these groups received financial support from Libya, which came to be seen as a leader in the [[Third World]]'s struggle against [[colonialism]] and [[neocolonialism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=78–81, 150|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2pp=34–35, 40–53|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=151}} Though many of these groups were labelled "[[terrorism|terrorists]]" by critics of their activities, Gaddafi rejected this characterization, instead considering them to be revolutionaries who were engaged in liberation struggles.{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=55}}

===The "Popular Revolution": 1973–1977===

[[File:Libya 1974 e.jpg|thumb|right|Gaddafi with Romanian communist leader [[Nicolae Ceausescu]] in Bucharest, Romania 1974]]

On 16 April 1973, Gaddafi proclaimed the start of a "Popular Revolution" in a speech at [[Zuwarah]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=139|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=85|3a1=Vandewalle|3y=2006|3p=82|4a1=Vandewalle|4y=2008b|4p=12|5a1=Kawczynski|5y=2011|5p=22|6a1=St. John|6y=2012|6p=156}} He initiated this with a five-point plan, the first point of which dissolved all existing laws, to be replaced by revolutionary enactments. The second point proclaimed that all opponents of the revolution had to be removed, while the third initiated an administrative revolution that Gaddafi proclaimed would remove all traces of [[bureaucracy]] and the [[bourgeoisie]]. The fourth point announced that the population must form People's Committees and be armed to defend the revolution, while the fifth proclaimed the beginning of a cultural revolution to expunge Libya of "poisonous" foreign influences.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=140|2a1=Harris|2y=1986|2p=18|3a1=Blundy|3a2=Lycett|3y=1987|3pp=85–86|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4p=22|5a1=St. John|5y=2012|5p=156}} He began to lecture on this new phase of the revolution in Libya, Egypt, and France.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|pp=93–94}} As a process, it had many similarities with the [[Cultural Revolution]] implemented in China.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=140}}

As part of this Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's people to found [[General People's Committee]]s as conduits for raising political consciousness. Although offering little guidance for how to set up these councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of [[Direct democracy|direct]] [[Participatory democracy|political participation]] that was more democratic than a traditional party-based [[Representative democracy|representative system]]. He hoped that the councils would mobilize the people behind the RCC, erode the power of the traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people.{{sfnm|1a1=El-Khawas|1y=1984|1p=20|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=86|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=156}} Many such committees were established in schools and colleges,{{sfnm|1a1=El-Khawas|1y=1984|1p=20|2a1=Bearman|2y=1986|2p=140}} where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=140}}

The People's Committees led to a high percentage of public involvement in decision making, within the limits permitted by the RCC,{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=157}} but exacerbated tribal divisions and tensions.{{sfnm|1a1=Davis|1y=1982|1p=78|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=103–104}} They also served as a surveillance system, aiding the security services in locating individuals with views critical of the RCC, leading to the arrest of [[Ba'athism|Ba'athists]], [[Marxism|Marxists]], and [[Islamism|Islamists]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=141|2a1=Harris|2y=1986|2p=18|3a1=Blundy|3a2=Lycett|3y=1987|3p=116|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=157}} Operating in a pyramid structure, the base form of these Committees were local working groups, who sent elected representatives to the district level, and from there to the national level, divided between the [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General People's Congress]] and the [[General People's Committee]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=104|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=26}} Above these remained Gaddafi and the RCC, who remained responsible for all major decisions.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=64|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=163}} In crossing regional and tribal identities, the committee system aided national integration and centralization and tightened Gaddafi's control over the state and administrative apparatus.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=141}}

==== Third Universal Theory and ''The Green Book'' ====
{{Main|Third International Theory|The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)}}

[[File:The-Green-Book-Muammar-Gaddafi-book-cover.jpg|thumb|right|An Arabic copy of ''The Green Book'']]

In June 1973, Gaddafi created a political ideology as a basis for the Popular Revolution: [[Third International Theory]]. This approach regarded both the US and the Soviet Union as imperialist and thus rejected Western [[capitalism]] as well as Marxist-Leninist atheism.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=150|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=86–87|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3pp=157–158}} In this respect, it was similar to the [[Three Worlds Theory]] developed by China's political leader [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=58}} As part of this theory, Gaddafi praised [[nationalism]] as a progressive force and advocated the creation of a pan-Arab state which would lead the Islamic and Third Worlds against imperialism.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=158}} Gaddafi saw Islam as having a key role in this ideology, calling for an [[Islamic revival]] that returned to the origins of the [[Qur'an]], rejecting scholarly interpretations and the [[Hadith]]; in doing so, he angered many Libyan clerics.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=122|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=159}} During 1973 and 1974, his government deepened the legal reliance on ''sharia'', for instance by introducing [[Flagellation|flogging]] as punishment for those convicted of adultery or homosexual activity.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=163|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=112}}

Gaddafi summarized Third International Theory in three short volumes published between 1975 and 1979, collectively known as ''[[The Green Book (Muammar Gaddafi)|The Green Book]]''. Volume one was devoted to the issue of democracy, outlining the flaws of representative systems in favour of direct, participatory GPCs. The second dealt with Gaddafi's beliefs regarding socialism, while the third explored social issues regarding the family and the tribe. While the first two volumes advocated radical reform, the third adopted a [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] stance, proclaiming that while men and women were equal, they were biologically designed for different roles in life.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=96–100|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2p=19|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=24|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4pp=161–165}} During the years that followed, Gaddafists adopted quotes from ''The Green Book'', such as "Representation is Fraud", as slogans.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=162}} Meanwhile, in September 1975, Gaddafi implemented further measures to increase popular mobilization, introducing objectives to improve the relationship between the Councils and the ASU.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=165}}

In 1975, Gaddafi's government declared a [[state monopoly]] on foreign trade.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|pp=145–146}} Its increasingly radical reforms, coupled with the large amount of oil revenue being spent on foreign causes, generated discontent in Libya,{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2008b|1p=18|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=23}} particularly among the country's merchant class.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=146}} In 1974, Libya saw its first civilian attack on Gaddafi's government when a Benghazi army building was bombed.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=114}} Much of the opposition centred around RCC member [[Omar Mehishi]]. With fellow RCC member [[Bashir Saghir al-Hawaadi]], he began plotting a coup against Gaddafi. In 1975, their plot was exposed and the pair fled into exile, receiving asylum from Sadat's Egypt.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=146|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=118|3a1=Vandewalle|3y=2008b|3p=18|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4p=23|5a1=St. John|5y=2012|5p=165}} In the aftermath, only five RCC members remained, and power was further concentrated in Gaddafi's hands.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=147}} This led to the RCC's official abolition in March 1977.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=165}}

In September 1975, Gaddafi purged the army, arresting around 200 senior officers, and in October he founded the clandestine Office for the Security of the Revolution.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|pp=118–119}} In April 1976, he called upon his supporters in universities to establish "revolutionary student councils" and drive out "reactionary elements".{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=148}} During that year, anti-Gaddafist student demonstrations broke out at the universities of Tripoli and Benghazi, resulting in clashes with both Gaddafist students and police. The RCC responded with mass arrests and introduced compulsory [[national service]] for young people.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=148|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=119–120|3a1=Vandewalle|3y=2008b|3p=18|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4p=23}} In January 1977, two dissenting students and a number of army officers were publicly hanged; [[Amnesty International]] condemned it as the first time in Gaddafist Libya that dissenters had been executed for purely political crimes.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|pp=121–122}} Dissent also arose from conservative clerics and the Muslim Brotherhood, who accused Gaddafi of moving towards Marxism and criticized his abolition of private property as being against the Islamic ''[[sunnah]]''; these forces were then persecuted as anti-revolutionary,{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=162|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=122–123|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3pp=29–30}} while all privately owned Islamic colleges and universities were shut down.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=148}}

====Foreign relations====

Following Anwar Sadat's ascension to the Egyptian presidency, Libya's relations with Egypt deteriorated.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=74, 93–94|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=66}} Over the coming years, the two slipped into a state of [[Cold war (general term)|cold war]].{{sfn|Bearman|1986|pp=166–167}} Sadat was perturbed by Gaddafi's unpredictability and insistence that Egypt required a cultural revolution akin to that being carried out in Libya.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=74, 93–94|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=66}} In February 1973, Israeli forces shot down [[Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114]], which had strayed from Egyptian airspace into Israeli-held territory during a sandstorm. Gaddafi was infuriated that Egypt had not done more to prevent the incident, and in retaliation planned to destroy the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth 2}}, a British ship chartered by American Jews to sail to [[Haifa]] for Israel's 25th anniversary. Gaddafi ordered an Egyptian submarine to target the ship, but Sadat cancelled the order, fearing a military escalation.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=114–115|2a1=Harris|2y=1986|2p=87|3a1=Blundy|3a2=Lycett|3y=1987|3pp=82–83|4a1=St. John|4y=1987|4p=55|5a1=Kawczynski|5y=2011|5pp=66–67}}

[[File:Gaddafi 1976.jpg|thumb|left|Gaddafi in 1976 with his son [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] on his lap]]

Gaddafi was later infuriated when Egypt and Syria planned the [[Yom Kippur War]] against Israel without consulting him and was angered when Egypt conceded to peace talks rather than continuing the war.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=99–100|2a1=Harris|2y=1986|2p=87|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=67|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4pp=182–183}} Gaddafi became openly hostile to Egypt's leader, calling for Sadat's overthrow.{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|p=67}} When Sudanese President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] took Sadat's side, Gaddafi also spoke out against him, encouraging the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]]'s attempt to overthrow Nimeiry.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=167|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=185|3a1=St. John|3y=1987|3p=62|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4pp=79–80|5a1=St. John|5y=2012|5p=191}} Relations with Syria also soured over the events in the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. Initially, both Libya and Syria had contributed troops to the Arab League's peacekeeping force, although after the Syrian army attacked the [[Lebanese National Movement]], Gaddafi openly accused Syrian President [[Hafez al-Assad]] of "national treason"; he was the only Arab leader to criticize Syria's actions.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|pp=165–166}} In late 1972 and early 1973, Libya invaded Chad to annex the uranium-rich [[Aouzou Strip]].{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=181|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=187}}

Intent on propagating Islam, in 1973 Gaddafi founded the Islamic Call Society, which had opened 132 centres across Africa within a decade.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=106–107|2a1=Harris|2y=1986|2pp=103–104|3a1=Blundy|3a2=Lycett|3y=1987|3pp=93, 122|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=186}} In 1973 he converted Gabonese President [[Omar Bongo]], an action which he repeated three years later with [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], president of the [[Central African Republic]].{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|pp=77–78}} Between 1973 and 1979, Libya provided $500&nbsp;million in aid to African countries, namely to Zaire and Uganda, and founded joint-venture companies throughout the countries to aid trade and development.{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=96}} Gaddafi was also keen on reducing Israeli influence within Africa, using financial incentives to successfully convince eight African states to break off diplomatic relations with Israel in 1973.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=107–109|2a1=Harris|2y=1986|2p=88|3a1=St. John|3y=1987|3p=94|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4p=77|5a1=St. John|5y=2012|5p=184}} A strong relationship was also established between Gaddafi's Libya and Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]'s Pakistani government, with the two countries exchanging nuclear research and military assistance; this relationship ended after Bhutto was deposed by [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] in 1977.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=169}}

Gaddafi sought to develop closer links in the [[Maghreb]]; in January 1974 Libya and Tunisia announced a political union, the [[Arab Islamic Republic]]. Although advocated by Gaddafi and Tunisian President [[Habib Bourguiba]], the move was deeply unpopular in Tunisia, and it was soon abandoned.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=100–101|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=76|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3pp=71–72|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=183}} Retaliating, Gaddafi sponsored anti-government militants in Tunisia into the 1980s.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=72|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=183}} Turning his attention to [[Algeria]], in 1975 Libya signed the Hassi Messaoud defensive alliance allegedly to counter alleged "Moroccan expansionism", also funding the [[Polisario Front]] of [[Western Sahara]] in its independence struggle against [[Morocco]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=170|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=71|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=183}} Seeking to diversify Libya's economy, Gaddafi's government began purchasing shares in major European corporations like [[Fiat]] as well as buying real estate in Malta and Italy, which would become a valuable source of income during the [[1980s oil glut|1980s oil slump]].{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=114|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=199–201}}

==Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya==

===Foundation: 1977===

On 2 March 1977, the General People's Congress adopted the "Declaration of the Establishment of the People's Authority" at Gaddafi's behest. Dissolving the Libyan Arab Republic, it was replaced by the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ({{lang-ar|الجماهيرية العربية الليبية الشعبية الاشتراكية}}, ''{{transl|ar|al-Jamāhīrīyah al-‘Arabīyah al-Lībīyah ash-Sha‘bīyah al-Ishtirākīyah}})'', a "state of the masses" conceptualized by Gaddafi.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=154–155|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=105|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3pp=26–27|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4pp=166–168}} A new, all-green banner was adopted as the country's flag.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=155}} Officially, the ''Jamahiriya'' was a [[direct democracy]] in which the people ruled themselves through the 187 [[Basic People's Congress (political)|Basic People's Congress]]es (BPCs), where all adult Libyans participated and voted on national decisions. These then sent members to the annual General People's Congress, which was broadcast live on television. In principle, the People's Congresses were Libya's highest authority, with major decisions proposed by government officials or with Gaddafi himself requiring the consent of the People's Congresses.{{sfnm|1a1=El-Khawas|1y=1984|1p=27|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=29|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3pp=166–168|4a1=Vandewalle|4y=2008b|4pp=19–20}} Gaddafi became General Secretary of the GPC, although he stepped down from this position in early 1979 and appointed himself "Leader of the Revolution".{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=13}}

[[File:Flag of Libya (1977-2011).svg|thumb|left|200px|[[Flag of Libya]] (1977–2011)]]

Although all political control was officially vested in the People's Congresses, in reality Libya's existing political leadership continued to exercise varying degrees of power and influence.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=155}} Debate remained limited, and major decisions regarding the economy and defence were avoided or dealt with cursorily; the GPC largely remained "a rubber stamp" for Gaddafi's policies.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=29}} On rare occasions, the GPC opposed Gaddafi's suggestions, sometimes successfully; notably, when Gaddafi called on primary schools to be abolished, believing that [[home schooling|homeschooling]] was healthier for children, the GPC rejected the idea.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=29}} In other instances, Gaddafi pushed through laws without the GPC's support, such as when he desired to allow women into the armed forces.{{sfn|Harris|1986|pp=67–68}} At other times, he ordered snap elections when it appeared that the GPC would enact laws he opposed.{{sfn|St. John|1987|pp=133–134}} Gaddafi proclaimed that the People's Congresses provided for Libya's every political need, rendering other political organizations unnecessary; all non-authorized groups, including political parties, professional associations, independent trade unions, and women's groups, were banned.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=27|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2pp=166–168}} Despite these restrictions, St. John noted that the ''Jamhariyah'' system still "introduced a level of representation and participation hitherto unknown in Libya".{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=134}}

With preceding legal institutions abolished, Gaddafi envisioned the ''Jamahiriya'' as following the [[Qur'an]] for legal guidance, adopting ''sharia'' law; he proclaimed "man-made" laws unnatural and dictatorial, only permitting [[God in Islam|Allah]]'s law.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1pp=27–28|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=167}} Within a year he was backtracking, announcing that ''sharia'' was inappropriate for the ''Jamahiriya'' because it guaranteed the protection of private property, contravening ''The Green Book''{{'s}} socialism.{{sfn|Vandewalle|2008b|p=28}} His emphasis on placing his own work on a par with the Qur'an led conservative clerics to accuse him of ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'', furthering their opposition to his regime.{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=50}} In July 1977, a [[Libyan–Egyptian War|border war broke out]] with Egypt, in which the Egyptians defeated Libya despite their technological inferiority. The conflict lasted one week before both sides agreed to sign a peace treaty that was brokered by several Arab states.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=170–171|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=105|3a1=Vandewalle|3y=2008b|3p=35|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4pp=67–68|5a1=St. John|5y=2012|5p=183}} Both Egypt and Sudan had aligned themselves with the US, and this pushed Libya into a strategic, although not political, alignment with the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=168}} In recognition of the growing commercial relationship between Libya and the Soviets, Gaddafi was invited to visit Moscow in December 1976; there, he entered talks with [[Leonid Brezhnev]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=169|2a1=St. John|2y=1987|2p=76|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=180}} In August 1977, he visited [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], where he met its leader [[Josip Broz Tito]], with whom he had a much warmer relationship.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=169}}

===Revolutionary Committees and furthering socialism: 1978–1980===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=If socialism is defined as a redistribution of wealth and resources, a socialist revolution clearly occurred in Libya after 1969 and most especially in the second half of the 1970s. The management of the economy was increasingly socialist in intent and effect with wealth in housing, capital and land significantly redistributed or in the process of redistribution. Private enterprise was virtually eliminated, largely replaced by a centrally controlled economy.|salign = right |source=—Libyan Studies scholar Ronald Bruce St. John{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=173}}}}

In December 1978, Gaddafi stepped down as Secretary-General of the GPC, announcing his new focus on revolutionary rather than governmental activities; this was part of his new emphasis on separating the apparatus of the revolution from the government. Although no longer in a formal governmental post, he adopted the title of "Leader of the Revolution" and continued as commander-in-chief of the armed forces.{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2008b|1p=26|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=3|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=169}} The historian Dirk Vandewalle stated that despite the Jamahariya's claims to being a direct democracy, Libya remained "an exclusionary political system whose decision-making process" was "restricted to a small cadre of advisers and confidantes" surrounding Gaddafi.{{sfn|Vandewalle|2006|p=6}}

Libya began to turn towards socialism. In March 1978, the government issued guidelines for housing redistribution, attempting to ensure that every adult Libyan owned their own home. Most families were banned from owning more than one house, while former rental properties were expropriated by the state and sold to the tenants at a heavily subsidized price.{{sfnm|1a1=St. John|1y=1983|1p=484|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=111|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=221|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4pp=171–172}} In September, Gaddafi called for the People's Committees to eliminate the "bureaucracy of the public sector" and the "dictatorship of the private sector"; the People's Committees took control of several hundred companies, converting them into [[worker cooperative]]s run by elected representatives.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=191|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=110–111|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=168}}

On 2 March 1979, the GPC announced the separation of government and revolution, the latter being represented by new Revolutionary Committees, who operated in tandem with the People's Committees in schools, universities, unions, the police force, and the military.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=116–117, 127|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2pp=25–26|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=31|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4pp=169–171}} Dominated by revolutionary zealots, most of whom were youths, the Revolutionary Committees were led by Mohammad Maghgoub and a Central Coordinating Office based in Tripoli and met with Gaddafi annually.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=187–189|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=116–117, 127|3a1=Vandewalle|3y=2008b|3pp=25–26|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4p=31|5a1=St. John|5y=2012|5pp=169–171}} Membership of the Revolutionary Committees was drawn from within the BPCs.{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=134}} According to Bearman, the revolutionary committee system became "a key—if not the main—mechanism through which [Gaddafi] exercises political control in Libya".{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=189}} Publishing a weekly magazine ''The Green March'' (''al-Zahf al-Akhdar''), in October 1980 they took control of the press.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=116–117, 127|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2pp=25–26|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=31|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4pp=169–171}} Responsible for perpetuating revolutionary fervour, they performed ideological surveillance, later adopting a significant security role, making arrests and putting people on trial according to the "law of the revolution" (''qanun al-thawra'').{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=189|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=116–117, 127|3a1=Vandewalle|3y=2008b|3pp=25–26|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4p=31|5a1=St. John|5y=2012|5pp=169–171}} With no legal code or safeguards, the administration of revolutionary justice was largely arbitrary and resulted in widespread abuses and the suppression of [[civil liberties]]: the "Green Terror".{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=117|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2p=28|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=174}}

[[File:Gaddafi with Yasser arafat 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Gaddafi with [[Yasser Arafat]] in 1977]]

In 1979, the committees began the redistribution of land in the Jefara plain, continuing through 1981.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=275|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=172}} In May 1980, measures to redistribute and equalize wealth were implemented; anyone with over 1000 [[Libyan dinar|dinar]] in their bank account saw that extra money expropriated.{{sfnm|1a1=St. John|1y=1983|1p=484|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=128|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=221|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=172}} The following year, the GPC announced that the government would take control of all import, export and distribution functions, with state supermarkets replacing privately owned businesses; this led to a decline in the availability of consumer goods and the development of a thriving [[black market]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=195|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=28|3a1=Vandewalle|3y=2008b|3p=21|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4p=220|5a1=St. John|5y=2012|5p=172}} Gaddafi was also frustrated by the slow pace of social reform on women's issues, and in 1979 launched a Revolutionary Women's Formation to replace the more gradualist Libyan General Women's Federation.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=199}} In 1978 he had established a Women's Military Academy in Tripoli, encouraging all women to enlist for training.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=241}} The measure was hugely controversial, and voted down by the GPC in February 1983. Gaddafi remained adamant, and when it was again voted down by the GPC in March 1984, he refused to abide by the decision, declaring that "he who opposes the training and emancipation of women is an agent of imperialism, whether he likes it or not."{{sfn|Bearman|1986|pp=241–243}}

The ''Jamahiriya'''s radical direction earned the government many enemies. Most internal opposition came from [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalists]], who were inspired by the events of the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]].{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=246}} In February 1978, Gaddafi discovered that his head of military intelligence was plotting to kill him, and began to increasingly entrust security to his Qaddadfa tribe.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1pp=127–128|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2p=19}} Many who had seen their wealth and property confiscated turned against the administration, and a number of Western-funded opposition groups were founded by exiles.

===Conflict with the US and its allies: 1981–1986===

The early and mid-1980s saw economic trouble for Libya; from 1982 to 1986, the country's annual oil revenues dropped from $21 billion to $5.4 billion.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=31|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2p=23|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=104|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=192}} Focusing on irrigation projects, 1983 saw construction start on Libya's largest and most expensive infrastructure project, the [[Great Man-Made River]]; although designed to be finished by the end of the decade, it remained incomplete at the start of the 21st century.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=274|2a1=Harris|2y=1986|2p=119|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=224|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=249}} Military spending increased, while other administrative budgets were cut back.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=116|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2p=35}} Libya's foreign debt rose,{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=121}} and austerity measures were introduced to promote self-reliance; in August 1985 there was a mass deportation of foreign workers, most of them Egyptian and Tunisian.{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=122}} Domestic threats continued to plague Gaddafi; in May 1984, his [[Bab al-Azizia]] home was unsuccessfully attacked by a militia—linked either to the NFSL or the Muslim Brotherhood—and in the aftermath 5,000 dissidents were arrested.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=250|2a1=Harris|2y=1986|2p=70|3a1=Blundy|3a2=Lycett|3y=1987|3p=178}}

Libya had long supported the [[FROLINAT]] militia in neighbouring Chad, and in December 1980, re-invaded Chad at the request of the FROLINAT-controlled [[Transitional Government of National Unity|GUNT government]] to aid in the civil war; in January 1981, Gaddafi suggested a political merger. The [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) rejected this and called for a Libyan withdrawal, which came about in November 1981. The civil war resumed, and so Libya sent troops back in, clashing with French forces who supported the southern Chadian forces.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=211–222|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|3pp=187–190|3a1=Vandewalle|3y=2008b|3p=35|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4pp=189–190}} Many African nations were tired of Libya's interference in their affairs; by 1980, nine African states had severed diplomatic relations with Libya,{{sfnm|1a1=St. John|1y=1987|1p=101|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=189}} while in 1982 the OAU cancelled its scheduled conference in Tripoli to prevent Gaddafi gaining chairmanship.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=103|2a1=St. John|2y=1987|2p=102|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3p=81|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4pp=190–191}} Some African states, such as [[Jerry Rawlings]]' Ghana and [[Thomas Sankara]]'s Burkina Faso, nevertheless had warm relations with Libya during the 1980s.{{sfn|Haynes|1990|p=62}} Proposing political unity with Morocco, in August 1984, Gaddafi and Moroccan monarch [[Hassan II of Morocco|Hassan II]] signed the [[Oujda Treaty]], forming the Arab–African Union; such a union was considered surprising due to the strong political differences and longstanding enmity that existed between the two governments. Relations remained strained, particularly due to Morocco's friendly relations with the US and Israel; in August 1986, Hassan abolished the union.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1pp=261–262|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=214|3a1=St. John|3y=1987|3pp=66–67|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4pp=72–75|5a1=St. John|5y=2012|5p=216}}

After the US accused Libya of orchestrating the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing]], in which two American soldiers died, Reagan decided to retaliate militarily.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=287|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=4–5|3a1=Boyd-Judson|3y=2005|3p=79|4a1=Kawczynski|4y=2011|4p=122}} The CIA was critical of the move, believing that Syria was a greater threat and that an attack would strengthen Gaddafi's reputation; however Libya was recognized as a "soft target".{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|pp=5–6}} Reagan was supported by the UK but opposed by other European allies, who argued that it would contravene international law.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=102|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2pp=123–125}} In [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], orchestrated on 15 April 1986, US military planes launched a series of air-strikes on Libya, bombing military installations in various parts of the country, killing around 100 Libyans, including several civilians.

==="Revolution within a Revolution": 1987–1998===

The late 1980s saw a series of liberalizing economic reforms within Libya designed to cope with the decline in oil revenues. In May 1987, Gaddafi announced the start of the "Revolution within a Revolution", which began with reforms to industry and agriculture and saw the re-opening of small business.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=225|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=194}} Restrictions were placed on the activities of the Revolutionary Committees; in March 1988, their role was narrowed by the newly created Ministry for Mass Mobilization and Revolutionary Leadership to restrict their violence and judicial role, while in August 1988 Gaddafi publicly criticized them.{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2008b|1p=29|2a1=St. John|2y=2008|2p=97|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3pp=194–195, 199–200}}

In March, hundreds of political prisoners were freed, with Gaddafi falsely claiming that there were no further political prisoners in Libya.{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2008b|1p=45|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=222}} In June, Libya's government issued the Great Green Charter on Human Rights in the Era of the Masses, in which 27 articles laid out goals, rights, and guarantees to improve the situation of human rights in Libya, restricting the use of the death penalty and calling for its eventual abolition. Many of the measures suggested in the charter would be implemented the following year, although others remained inactive.{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2008b|1pp=45–46|2a1=St. John|2y=2008|2pp=97–98|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3pp=197–198}} Also in 1989, the government founded the [[Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights]], to be awarded to figures from the Third World who had struggled against colonialism and imperialism; the first year's winner was South African anti-apartheid activist [[Nelson Mandela]].{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=199}} From 1994 through to 1997, the government initiated cleansing committees to root out corruption, particularly in the economic sector.{{sfn|St. John|2012|pp=197–198}}

In the aftermath of the 1986 US attack, the army was purged of perceived disloyal elements,{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|p=130}} and in 1988, Gaddafi announced the creation of a popular militia to replace the army and police.{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2008b|1p=38|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=200}} In 1987, [[Libya and weapons of mass destruction|Libya began production]] of [[mustard gas]] at a facility in Rabta, although publicly denied it was stockpiling chemical weapons,{{sfn|St. John|2012|pp=201–204}} and unsuccessfully attempted to develop nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|pp=180–181}} The period also saw a growth in domestic Islamist opposition, formulated into groups like the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]]. Several assassination attempts against Gaddafi were foiled, and in turn, 1989 saw the security forces raid mosques believed to be centres of counter-revolutionary preaching.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1pp=166–167, 236|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2pp=221–222}} In October 1993, elements of the increasingly marginalized army initiated a failed coup in [[Misrata]], while in September 1995, Islamists launched an insurgency in Benghazi, and in July 1996 an anti-Gaddafist football riot broke out in Tripoli.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=166|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=223}} The Revolutionary Committees experienced a resurgence to combat these Islamists.{{sfn|Vandewalle|2008b|p=29}}

In 1989, Gaddafi was overjoyed by the foundation of the [[Arab Maghreb Union]], uniting Libya in an economic pact with Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria, viewing it as beginnings of a new pan-Arab union.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=188|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2pp=216–218}} Meanwhile, Libya stepped up its support for anti-Western militants such as the Provisional IRA,{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=197}} and in 1988, [[Pan Am Flight 103]] was blown up over [[Lockerbie]] in Scotland, killing 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus 11 people on the ground. British police investigations identified two Libyans&nbsp;– [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]] and [[Lamin Khalifah Fhimah]]&nbsp;– as the chief suspects, and in November 1991 issued a declaration demanding that Libya hand them over. When Gaddafi refused, citing the [[Montreal Convention]], the United Nations (UN) imposed Resolution 748 in March 1992, initiating economic sanctions against Libya which had deep repercussions for the country's economy.{{sfnm|1a1=Boyd-Judson|1y=2005|1pp=80–81|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008b|2p=39|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3pp=133–140|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4pp=205–207}} The country suffered an estimated US$900&nbsp;million financial loss as a result.{{sfn|Vandewalle|2008b|p=42}} Further problems arose with the West when in January 1989, [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1989)|two Libyan warplanes were shot down by the US off the Libyan coast]].{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=202}}

At the 20th century's end, Gaddafi—frustrated by the failure of his pan-Arab ideals—increasingly rejected Arab nationalism in favour of [[pan-Africanism]], emphasizing Libya's African identity.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=142|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=227}} From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 African states,{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=229}} and in 1999 joined the [[Community of Sahel-Saharan States]].{{sfnm|1a1=St. John|1y=2008|1p=99|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2p=189}} In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa,{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=226}} and the following month attended the OAU summit in [[Algiers]], calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a [[United States of Africa]].{{sfn|St. John|2012|pp=227–228}} He became one of the founders of the [[African Union]] (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU; at the opening ceremonies, he called for African states to reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=190|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=229}} There was speculation that Gaddafi wanted to become the AU's first chair, raising concerns within Africa that this would damage the Union's international standing, particularly with the West.{{sfn|Ramutsindela|2009|p=3}}

In 2004, Gaddafi traveled to the headquarters of the [[European Union]] (EU) in [[Brussels]]—signifying improved relations between Libya and the EU—and the EU dropped its sanctions on Libya.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=175|2a1=St. John|2y=2008|2p=101|3a1=St. John|3y=2012|3p=237}} As a strategic player in Europe's attempts to stem illegal migration from Africa,{{sfn|Zoubir|2009|p=408}} in October 2010, the EU paid Libya over €50&nbsp;million to stop African migrants passing into Europe; Gaddafi encouraged the move, saying that it was necessary to prevent the loss of European cultural identity to a new "Black Europe".{{sfnm|1a1=St. John|1y=2012|1p=274|2a1=Kamel|2y=2016|2p=684}} Gaddafi also completed agreements with the Italian government that they would invest in various infrastructure projects as reparations for past Italian colonial policies in Libya.{{sfn|Zoubir|2009|p=410}} Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] gave Libya an official apology in 2006, after which Gaddafi called him the "iron man" for his courage in doing so.{{sfn|Zoubir|2009|pp=410–411}} In August 2008, Gaddafi and Berlusconi signed a historic cooperation [[treaty]] in [[Benghazi]];<ref name="treaty">{{cite web |url=http://www.senato.it/parlam/leggi/09007l.htm |title=Ratifica ed esecuzione del Trattato di amicizia, partenariato e cooperazione tra la Repubblica italiana e la Grande Giamahiria araba libica popolare socialista, fatto a Bengasi il 30 August 2008 |language=it |publisher=[[Parliament of Italy]] press release |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618082911/http://www.senato.it/parlam/leggi/09007l.htm |archive-date=18 June 2009}}</ref><ref name="ansa">{{cite news |url=http://www.ansa.it/site/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2009-06-09_109379246.html |publisher=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]] |title=Gaddafi to Rome for Historic Visit |date=10 June 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616155752/http://www.ansa.it/site/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2009-06-09_109379246.html |archive-date=16 June 2009 }}</ref> under its terms, Italy would pay $5&nbsp;billion to Libya as compensation for its former [[Italian Libya|military occupation]].

====Economic reform====
Libya's economy witnessed increasing [[privatization]]; although rejecting the socialist policies of nationalized industry advocated in ''The Green Book'', government figures asserted that they were forging "people's socialism" rather than capitalism.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=250}} Gaddafi welcomed these reforms, calling for wide-scale privatization in a March 2003 speech;{{sfn|Vandewalle|2008a|p=224}} he promised that Libya would join the [[World Trade Organization]].{{sfn|St. John|2008|pp=101–102}} These reforms encouraged private investment in Libya's economy.{{sfn|Kamel|2016|p=697}} By 2004, there was US$40&nbsp;billion of direct foreign investment in Libya, a sixfold rise over 2003.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=180|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=248}} Sectors of Libya's population reacted against these reforms with public demonstrations,{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=248}} and in March 2006, revolutionary hard-liners took control of the GPC cabinet; although scaling back the pace of the changes, they did not halt them.{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2008a|1p=228|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2pp=249–250}} In 2010, plans were announced that would have seen half the Libyan economy privatized over the following decade,{{sfn|St. John|2012|pp=263–264}} these plans appear to have been soon abandoned however, as the companies that the government stated they were going to float on the stock market, among them the National Commercial Bank and the [[Libyan Iron and Steel Company]] were never floated and remained 100% state-owned. Many socialist policies remained however, with subsidiaries of logistics company HB Group being nationalized in 2007.<ref>https://hbgroup.ly/about</ref> Agriculture remained largely untouched by the reforms, with farms remaining cooperatives, the [[Agricultural Bank of Libya]] remaining wholly state-owned and state interventionist policies and price controls remaining.<ref>https://www.g-fras.org/es/world-wide-extension-study/africa/northern-africa/libya.html</ref> The oil industry remained largely state-owned, with the wholly state-owned National Oil Corporation retaining a 70% share in Libya's oil industry, the government also imposed a 93% tax on all oil that foreign companies produced in Libya.<ref>https://money.cnn.com/2011/10/25/news/international/libya_oil/index.htm</ref> Price controls and subsidies over oil and food remained in place, and state-provided benefits such as free education, universal healthcare, free housing, free water and free electricity remained in place.<ref>https://www.africanexponent.com/post/ten-reasons-libya-under-gaddafi-was-a-great-place-to-live-2746</ref>

While there was no accompanying political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control,{{sfn|Vandewalle|2008a|p=231}} in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=257}} Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of a new constitution, although it was never adopted.{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2008a|1p=225|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2pp=249–269}} Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticizing the government, they were nationalized in 2009.{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|pp=216, 227–228}}

==Libyan Civil War==

===Origins and development: February–August 2011===
[[File:Protest In Dublin Gaddafi Is A Murderer.jpg|thumb|280px|People protesting against Gaddafi in [[Dublin]], Ireland, March 2011]]
Following the start of the [[Arab Spring]] in 2011, Gaddafi spoke out in favour of Tunisian President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]], then threatened by the [[Tunisian Revolution]]. He suggested that Tunisia's people would be satisfied if Ben Ali introduced a ''Jamahiriyah'' system there.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=278}} Fearing domestic protest, Libya's government implemented preventive measures by reducing [[food prices]], purging the army leadership of potential defectors, and releasing several Islamist prisoners.{{sfn|St. John|2012|pp=282–283}} This proved ineffective, and on 17 February 2011, major protests broke out against Gaddafi's government. Unlike Tunisia or Egypt, Libya was largely religiously homogeneous and had no strong Islamist movement, but there was widespread dissatisfaction with the corruption and entrenched systems of patronage, while unemployment had reached around 30 per cent.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=231|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2pp=279–281}}

Accusing the rebels of being "drugged" and linked to al-Qaeda, Gaddafi proclaimed that he would die a [[martyr]] rather than leave Libya.{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|p=242}} As he announced that the rebels would be "hunted down street by street, house by house and wardrobe by wardrobe",{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|pp=242–243}} the army opened fire on protests in Benghazi, killing hundreds.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=283}} Shocked at the government's response, a number of senior politicians resigned or defected to the protesters' side.{{sfnm|1a1=St. John|1y=2012|1p=284|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2008a|2p=236}} The uprising spread quickly through Libya's less economically developed eastern half.{{sfn|Vandewalle|2008a|p=236}} By February's end, eastern cities such as Benghazi, Misrata, al-Bayda, and Tobruk were controlled by rebels,{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=284}} and the Benghazi-based [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) formed to represent them.{{sfnm|1a1=St. John|1y=2012|1p=286|2a1=Human Rights Watch|2y=2012|2p=16}}

In the conflict's early months it appeared that Gaddafi's government—with its greater fire-power—would be victorious.{{sfn|Vandewalle|2008a|p=236}} Both sides disregarded the [[laws of war]], committing human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial executions, and revenge attacks.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|2012|pp=17–18}} On 26 February the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970|Resolution 1970]], suspending Libya from the [[UN Human Rights Council]], implementing sanctions and calling for an [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) investigation into the killing of unarmed civilians.{{sfnm|1a1=Sacerdoti|1a2=Acconci|1y=2011|1pp=61–62|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=284|3a1=Human Rights Watch|3y=2012|3p=16}} In March, the Security Council declared a [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|no-fly zone]] to protect the civilian population from aerial bombardment, calling on foreign nations to enforce it; it also specifically prohibited foreign occupation.{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2008a|1p=236|2a1=Human Rights Watch|2y=2012|2p=16}} Ignoring this, Qatar sent hundreds of troops to support the dissidents and, along with France and the United Arab Emirates, provided weaponry and military training to the NTC.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|2012|p=16}} NATO announced that it would enforce the no-fly zone.{{sfnm|1a1=Vandewalle|1y=2008a|1p=236|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=284}} On 30 April a NATO airstrike killed [[Saif al-Arab Gaddafi|Gaddafi's sixth son]] and three of his grandsons in Tripoli.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Simon|last1=Denyer|first2=Leila|last2=Fadel|title=Gaddafi's Youngest Son Killed in NATO Airstrike; Russia Condemns Attack|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/gaddafi-calls-for-cease-fire-as-nato-strikes-tripoli/2011/04/30/AF1jZsNF_story.html|accessdate=21 January 2012|website=The Washington Post|date=30 April 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713201116/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/gaddafi-calls-for-cease-fire-as-nato-strikes-tripoli/2011/04/30/AF1jZsNF_story.html |archive-date=13 July 2017}}</ref> This Western military intervention was criticized by various leftist governments, including those that had criticized Gaddafi's response to the protests, because they regarded it as an imperialist attempt to secure control of Libya's resources.{{sfn|Castro|2011|pp=308–309}}

In June, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Gaddafi, his son Saif al-Islam, and his brother-in-law [[Abdullah Senussi]], head of state security, for charges concerning crimes against humanity.{{sfnm|1a1=Kawczynski|1y=2011|1p=257|2a1=St. John|2y=2012|2p=286}} That month, [[Amnesty International]] published their report, finding that while Gaddafi's forces were responsible for numerous war crimes, many other allegations of mass human rights abuses lacked credible evidence and were likely fabrications by rebel forces that had been promoted by Western media.<ref name="AmnestyRape">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/amnesty-questions-claim-that-gaddafi-ordered-rape-as-weapon-of-war-2302037.html|title=Amnesty Questions Claim That Gaddafi Ordered Rape as Weapon of War|date=24 June 2011|work=The Independent|location=London|accessdate=26 June 2011|first=Patrick|last=Cockburn|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218024655/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/amnesty-questions-claim-that-gaddafi-ordered-rape-as-weapon-of-war-2302037.html|archive-date=18 February 2017}}</ref> In July, over 30 governments recognized the NTC as the legitimate government of Libya; Gaddafi called on his supporters to "Trample on those recognitions, trample on them under your feet&nbsp;...

==Political ideology==
{{main|Third International Theory}}
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=We call it the Third [International] Theory to indicate that there is a new path for all those who reject both materialist capitalism and atheist communism.

Gaddafi's ideological worldview was molded by his environment, namely his Islamic faith, his Bedouin upbringing, and his disgust at the actions of Italian colonialists in Libya.{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=43}} As a schoolboy, Gaddafi adopted the ideologies of [[Arab nationalism]] and [[Arab socialism]], influenced in particular by [[Nasserism]], the thought of the Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], whom Gaddafi regarded as his hero;{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=43|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=18}} Nasser privately described Gaddafi as "a nice boy, but terribly naïve".{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=18}} During the early 1970s, Gaddafi formulated his own particular approach to Arab nationalism and socialism, known as [[Third International Theory]], which ''[[The New York Times]]'' described as a combination of "[[utopian socialism]], Arab nationalism, and the Third World revolutionary theory that was in vogue at the time".<ref name="nytimes_green">{{cite news|last=Bazzi|first=Mohamad|title=What Did Qaddafi's Green Book Really Say?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/books/review/what-did-qaddafis-green-book-really-say.html|accessdate=28 October 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=27 May 2011}}</ref> He regarded this system as a practical alternative to the then-dominant international models of Western capitalism and [[Marxism–Leninism]].{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=28}} He laid out the principles of this Theory in the three volumes of ''The Green Book'', in which he sought to "explain the structure of the ideal society".{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=57}}

The Libyan studies specialist Ronald Bruce St. John regarded Arab nationalism as Gaddafi's "primordial value",{{sfnm|1a1=St. John|1y=1983|1p=473|2a1=St. John|2y=1987|2p=21|3a1=St. John|3y=2008|3p=92}} stating that during the early years of his government, Gaddafi was "the Arab nationalist par excellence".{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=26}} Gaddafi called for the Arab world to regain its dignity and assert a major place on the world stage, blaming Arab backwardness on stagnation resulting from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, European colonialism and imperialism, and corrupt and repressive monarchies.{{sfnm|1a1=St. John|1y=1983|1p=474|2a1=St. John|2y=1987|2pp=26–27}} Gaddafi's Arab nationalist views led him to the [[pan-Arabist]] belief in the need for unity across the Arab world, combining the Arab nation under a single nation-state.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=59|2a1=St. John|2y=1987|2pp=19, 49}} To this end, he had proposed a political union with five neighbouring Arab states by 1974, although without success.{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=58}} In keeping with his views regarding Arabs, his political stance was described as [[nativism (politics)|nativist]].{{sfn|Hinnebusch|1984|p=63}} Gaddafi also had international ambitions, wanting to export his revolutionary ideas throughout the world.{{sfnm|1a1=Haynes|1y=1990|1p=59|2a1=Pargeter|2y=2012|2p=3}} Gaddafi saw his socialist ''Jamahiriyah'' as a model for the Arab, Islamic, and non-aligned worlds to follow,{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=54}} and in his speeches declared that his Third International Theory would eventually guide the entire planet.{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=34}} He nevertheless had minimal success in exporting the ideology outside of Libya.{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=29}}

Along with Arab nationalism, anti-imperialism was also a defining feature of Gaddafi's regime during its early years. He believed in opposing Western imperialism and colonialism in the Arab world, including any Western expansionism through the form of Israel.{{sfn|Zoubir|2009|p=402}} He offered support to a broad range of political groups abroad that called themselves "anti-imperialist", especially those that set themselves in opposition to the United States.{{sfn|Haynes|1990|p=60}} For many years, [[anti-Zionism]] was a fundamental component of Gaddafi's ideology. He believed that the state of Israel should not exist and that any Arab compromise with the Israeli government was a betrayal of the Arab people.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=18}} In large part due to their support of Israel, Gaddafi despised the United States, considering the country to be [[Imperialism|imperialist]] and lambasting it as "the embodiment of evil".{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|pp=19, 197}} He sought to distinguish "oriental" Jews who had lived in the Middle East for generations from the European Jews who had migrated to Palestine during the 20th century, calling the latter "vagabonds" and "mercenaries" who should return to Europe.{{sfn|St. John|1983|p=478}} He rallied against Jews in many of his speeches, with Blundy and Lycett claiming that his [[anti-Semitism]] was "almost [[Adolf Hitler|Hitlerian]]".{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=25}} As Pan-Africanism increasingly became his focus in the early 21st century, Gaddafi became less interested in the Israel-Palestine issue, calling for the two communities to form a new [[One-state solution|single-state]] that he termed "[[Isratin]]".{{sfn|St. John|2008|p=100}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/opinion/22qaddafi.html |title=The One-State Solution |author=Gaddafi, Muammar |work=The New York Times |date=22 January 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2017}}.</ref> This would have led the Jewish population to become a minority within the new state.{{sfn|Karniel|Lavie-Dinur|Azran|2015|p=177}}

===Islamic modernism and Islamic socialism===

Gaddafi rejected the [[secularism|secularist]] approach to Arab nationalism that had been pervasive in Syria,{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=30}} with his revolutionary movement placing a far stronger emphasis on Islam than previous Arab nationalist movements had done.{{sfn|St. John|1983|p=473}} He deemed Arabism and Islam to be inseparable, referring to them as "one and indivisible",{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=161}} and called on the Arab world's Christian minority to convert to Islam.{{sfnm|1a1=St. John|1y=1983|1p=476|2a1=Bearman|2y=1986|2p=161|3a1=St. John|3y=1987|3p=30}} He insisted that Islamic law should be the basis for the law of the state, blurring any distinction between the religious and secular realms.{{sfn|First|1974|p=25}} He desired unity across the Islamic world,{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=19}} and encouraged the propagation of the faith elsewhere; on a 2010 visit to Italy, he paid a modelling agency to find 200 young Italian women for a lecture he gave urging them to convert.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Europe Should Convert to Islam: Gaddafi|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/Europe-should-convert-to-Islam-Gaddafi/articleshow/6464781.cms |website=The Times of India |url-status=live |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=30 August 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110109180255/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/Europe-should-convert-to-Islam-Gaddafi/articleshow/6464781.cms |archive-date=9 January 2011}}</ref> According to the Gaddafi biographer Jonathan Bearman, in Islamic terms Gaddafi was a [[Islamic Modernism|modernist]] rather than a [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]], for he subordinated religion to the political system rather than seeking to Islamicize the state as Islamists sought to do.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=164}} He was driven by a sense of "divine mission", believing himself a conduit of God's will, and thought that he must achieve his goals "no matter what the cost".{{sfn|Harris|1986|pp=45, 50}} His interpretation of Islam was nevertheless idiosyncratic,{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=164}} and he clashed with conservative Libyan clerics. Many criticized his attempts to encourage women to enter traditionally male-only sectors of society, such as the armed forces. Gaddafi was keen to improve women's status, although saw the sexes as "separate but equal" and therefore felt women should usually remain in traditional roles.{{sfn|Harris|1986|pp=33, 53}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=The purpose of the socialist society is the happiness of man, which can only be realized through material and spiritual freedom. Attainment of such freedom depends on the extent of man's ownership of his needs; ownership that is personal and sacredly guaranteed, i.e. your needs must neither be owned by somebody else, nor subject to plunder by any part of society.|salign = right |source=—Muammar Gaddafi{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=157}}}}

Gaddafi described his approach to economics as "Islamic socialism".{{sfnm|1a1=First|1y=1974|1p=255|2a1=St. John|2y=1983|2p=482|3a1=Harris|3y=1986|3p=48}} For him, a socialist society could be defined as one in which men controlled their own needs, either through personal ownership or through a collective.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=157}} Although the early policies pursued by his government were state capitalist in orientation, by 1978 he believed that private ownership of the means of production was exploitative and thus he sought to move Libya away from capitalism and towards socialism.{{sfn|Hinnebusch|1984|p=69}} Private enterprise was largely eliminated in favour of a centrally controlled economy.{{sfn|St. John|1983|p=484}} The extent to which Libya became socialist under Gaddafi is disputed. Bearman suggested that while Libya did undergo "a profound social revolution", he did not think that "a socialist society" was established in Libya.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=xvii}} Conversely, St. John expressed the view that "if socialism is defined as a redistribution of wealth and resources, a socialist revolution clearly occurred in Libya" under Gaddafi's regime.{{sfn|St. John|2012|p=173}}

Gaddafi was staunchly [[Anti-Marxism|anti-Marxist]],{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=104}} and in 1973 declared that "it is the duty of every Muslim to combat" Marxism because it promotes atheism.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=105}} In his view, ideologies like Marxism and Zionism were alien to the Islamic world and were a threat to the [[ummah]], or global Islamic community.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|pp=104–105}} Nevertheless, Blundy and Lycett noted that Gaddafi's socialism had a "curiously Marxist undertone",{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=98}} with political scientist Sami Hajjar arguing that Gaddafi's model of socialism offered a simplification of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]' theories.{{sfn|Hajjar|1982}} While acknowledging the Marxist influence on Gaddafi's thought, Bearman stated that the Libyan leader rejected Marxism's core tenet, that of [[class struggle]] as the main engine of social development.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=158}} Instead of embracing the Marxist idea that a socialist society emerged from class struggle between the [[proletariat]] and [[bourgeoisie]], Gaddafi believed that socialism would be achieved through overturning "unnatural" capitalism and returning society to its "natural equilibrium".{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=158}} In this, he sought to replace a capitalist economy with one based on his own romanticized ideas of a traditional, pre-capitalist past.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=159}} This owed much to the Islamic belief in [[God in Islam|God]]'s natural law providing order to the universe.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=160}}

==Personal life==

A very private individual,{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=43}} Gaddafi was given to rumination and solitude and could be reclusive.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=284}} The reporter Mirella Bianco interviewed Gaddafi's father, who stated that his son was "always serious, even taciturn", also being courageous, intelligent, pious, and family-oriented.{{sfn|Bianco|1975|p=7}} Gaddafi's friends described him to Bianco as a loyal and generous man.{{sfn|Bianco|1975|pp=10–12}} More widely, he was often regarded as being "bizarre, irrational or quixotic".{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=11}} Bearman noted that Gaddafi was emotionally volatile and had an impulsive temperament,{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=284}} with the CIA believing that the Libyan leader suffered from [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=21}} Gaddafi described himself as a "simple revolutionary" and "pious Muslim" called upon by God to continue Nasser's work.{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=48}} Gaddafi was an austere and devout Muslim,{{sfnm|1a1=St. John|1y=1987|1p=145|2a1=Vandewalle|2y=2006|2p=6}} although according to Vandewalle, his interpretation of Islam was "deeply personal and idiosyncratic."{{sfn|Vandewalle|2006|p=6}} He was also a [[Association football|football]] enthusiast{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=22}} and enjoyed both playing the sport and horse riding as a means of recreation.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=285}} He regarded himself as an intellectual;{{sfn|Pargeter|2012|p=2}} he was a fan of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and said his favourite novels were ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family|Roots]]'', and ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]''.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=22}}

Gaddafi regarded personal appearance as important,{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=285}} with Blundy and Lycett referring to him as "extraordinarily vain."{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=24}} Gaddafi had a large wardrobe, and sometimes changed his outfit multiple times a day.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=24}} He favoured either a military uniform or traditional Libyan dress, tending to eschew Western-style suits.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=285}} He saw himself as a fashion icon, stating "Whatever I wear becomes a fad. I wear a certain shirt and suddenly everyone is wearing it."{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=24}} Following his ascension to power, Gaddafi moved into the [[Bab al-Azizia]] barracks, a 6-square-kilometre (2.3 sq mi) fortified compound located two miles from the centre of Tripoli. His home and office at Azizia was a bunker designed by West German engineers, while the rest of his family lived in a large two-storey building. Within the compound were also two tennis courts, a football pitch, several gardens, camels and a Bedouin tent in which he entertained guests.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=1}} In the 1980s, his lifestyle was considered modest in comparison to those of many other Arab leaders.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=32}}

He was preoccupied with his own security, regularly changing where he slept and sometimes grounding all other planes in Libya when he was flying.{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=50}} He made particular requests when travelling to foreign countries.

According to Vandewalle, Gaddafi "dominated [Libya's] political life" during his period in power.{{sfn|Vandewalle|2006|p=5}} The sociologist Raymond A. Hinnebusch described the Libyan as "perhaps the most exemplary contemporary case of the politics of charismatic leadership", displaying all of the traits of [[charismatic authority]] outlined by the sociologist [[Max Weber]].{{sfn|Hinnebusch|1984|p=59}} According to Hinnebusch, the foundations of Gaddafi's "personal charismatic authority" in Libya stemmed from the blessing he had received from Nasser coupled with "nationalist achievements" such as the expulsion of foreign military bases, the extraction of higher prices for Libyan oil, and his vocal support for the Palestinian and other anti-imperialist causes.{{sfn|Hinnebusch|1984|p=62}}

A [[cult of personality]] devoted to Gaddafi existed in Libya through most of his rule.{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=283|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=20}} His biographer Alison Pargeter noted that "he filled every space, moulding the entire country around himself."{{sfn|Pargeter|2012|p=2}} Depictions of his face could be found throughout the country, including on postage stamps, watches, and school satchels.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=20}} Quotations from ''The Green Book'' appeared on a wide variety of places, from street walls to airports and pens, and were put to pop music for public release.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=20}} In private, Gaddafi often complained that he disliked this personality cult surrounding him, but that he tolerated it because the people of Libya adored him.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=20}} The cult served a political purpose, with Gaddafi helping to provide a central identity for the Libyan state.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=284}}

Several biographers and observers characterized Gaddafi as a [[populism|populist]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hinnebusch|1y=1984|1p=61|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=20}} He enjoyed attending lengthy public sessions where people were invited to question him; these were often televised.{{sfn|First|1974|pp=22–23}} Throughout Libya, crowds of supporters would arrive at public events where he appeared. Described as "spontaneous demonstrations" by the government, there are recorded instances of groups being coerced or paid to attend.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=16}} He was typically late to public events, and would sometimes fail to arrive.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=17}} Although Bianco thought he had a "gift for oratory",{{Sfn|Bianco|1975|p=7}} he was considered a poor orator by Blundy and Lycett.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=18}} The biographer [[Daniel Kawczynski]] noted that Gaddafi was famed for his "lengthy, wandering" speeches,{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|p=191}} which typically involved criticizing Israel and the US.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=17}} The journalist [[Ruth First]] described his speeches as being "an inexhaustible flow; didactic, at times incoherent; peppered with snatches of half-formed opinions; admonitions; confidences; some sound common sense, and as much prejudice".{{sfn|First|1974|p=23}}

==Reception and legacy==
{{Main|List of awards and honours bestowed upon Muammar Gaddafi}}
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Gaddaﬁ was a controversial and highly divisive world ﬁgure. Supporters lauded him for his willingness to tackle the unfair economic legacy of foreign domination as well as his support of pan-Africanism and pan-Arabism. Conversely, he was internationally condemned as a dictator whose authoritarian administration violated the human rights of Libyan citizens, persecuted dissidents abroad, and supported international terrorism.|salign = right |source=—Yuval Karniel, Amit Lavie-Dinur and Tal Azran, 2015{{sfn|Karniel|Lavie-Dinur|Azran|2015|p=172}}}}
Gaddafi was a controversial and highly divisive world figure.{{sfn|Karniel|Lavie-Dinur|Azran|2015|p=172}} According to Bearman, Gaddafi "evoked the extremes of passion: supreme adoration from his following, bitter contempt from his opponents".{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=xvi}} Bearman added that "in a country that formerly suffered foreign domination, [Gaddafi]'s anti-imperialism has proved enduringly popular".{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=283}} Gaddafi's domestic popularity stemmed from his overthrow of the monarchy, his removal of the Italian settlers and both American and British air bases from Libyan territory, and his redistribution of the country's land on a more equitable basis.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=283}} Supporters praised Gaddafi's administration for the creation of an almost classless society through domestic reform.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=19|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2pp=196–200}} They stressed the regime's achievements in combating homelessness, ensuring access to food and safe drinking water, and to dramatic improvements in education; under Gaddafi, literacy rates rose significantly, and all education to university level was free.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=19|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2pp=196–200}} Supporters have also applauded achievements in medical care, praising the universal free healthcare provided under the Gaddafist administration, with diseases like [[cholera]] and [[typhoid]] being contained and life expectancy raised.{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=19|2a1=Kawczynski|2y=2011|2pp=196–200}}

Biographers Blundy and Lycett believed that under the first decade of Gaddafi's leadership, life for most Libyans "undoubtedly changed for the better" as material conditions and wealth drastically improved,{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=107}} while Libyan studies specialist Lillian Craig Harris remarked that in the early years of his administration, Libya's "national wealth and international influence soared, and its national standard of living has risen dramatically".{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=63}} Such high standards declined during the 1980s, as a result of economic stagnation;{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=68}} it was in this decade that the number of Libyan defectors increased.{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=140}} Gaddafi claimed that his ''Jamahiriya'' was a "concrete utopia", and that he had been appointed by "popular assent",{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=15}} with some Islamic supporters believing that he exhibited ''[[barakah]]''.{{sfn|Harris|1986|p=43}} His opposition to Western governments earned him the respect of many in the Euro-American far right,{{sfn|Gardell|2003|p=325}} with the UK-based [[National Front (UK)|National Front]], for instance, embracing aspects of the Third International Theory during the 1980s.{{sfn|Sykes|2005|pp=119–120}} His anti-Western stance also attracted praise from the far left; in 1971, the Soviet Union awarded him the [[Order of Lenin]], although his mistrust of atheist Marxism prevented him from attending the ceremony in Moscow.{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=105}} First noted that, during the early 1970s, various students at the [[Paris 8 University]] were hailing Gaddafi as "the only Third World leader with any real stomach for struggle".{{sfn|First|1974|p=13}}

===Opposition and criticism===

The Libyan anti-Gaddafist movement brought together a diverse array of groups, which had varied motives and objectives.{{sfn|St. John|1987|p=140}} It comprised monarchists and members of the old, pre-Gaddafist elite, conservative nationalists who backed his Arab nationalist agenda but opposed his left-wing economic reforms, technocrats who had their future prospects stunted by the coup, and Islamic fundamentalists who opposed his radical reforms.{{sfn|St. John|1987|pp=139–140}} Members of Libya's merchant middle-class were often angered at the loss of their businesses through Gaddafi's nationalization program, while many Libyans objected to Gaddafi's use of the country's oil wealth to fund revolutionary activity abroad rather than domestic development in Libya itself.{{sfn|El-Khawas|1984|p=40}} He also faced opposition from rival socialists such as Ba'athists and Marxists;{{sfn|Ronen|1986|p=583}} during the Civil War, he was criticized by both left-of-centre and right-of-centre governments for overseeing human rights abuses.{{sfn|Castro|2011|p=308}} Dubbed the "mad dog of the Middle East" by Reagan,{{sfnm|1a1=Bearman|1y=1986|1p=xvi|2a1=Boyd-Judson|2y=2005|2p=79|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3pp=115–116, 120|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4pp=179–180}} Gaddafi became a bogeyman for Western governments,{{sfn|Bearman|1986|p=xvi}} who presented him as the "vicious dictator of an oppressed people".{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=15}} For these critics, Gaddafi was "despotic, cruel, arrogant, vain and stupid,"{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=31}} with Pargeter noting that "for many years, he came to be personified in the international media as a kind of super villain."{{sfn|Pargeter|2012|p=3}}

[[File:Gaddafi Is a Butcher - Libyan Protest Meeting In Dublin.jpg|thumb|left|An anti-Gaddafist placard being displayed by demonstrators in Ireland in 2011]]

According to critics, Libya's people lived in a climate of fear under Gaddafi's administration, due to his government's pervasive surveillance of civilians.{{sfnm|1a1=Harris|1y=1986|1p=68|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2p=29|3a1=Kawczynski|3y=2011|3pp=196, 208}} Gaddafi's Libya was typically described by Western commentators as a [[police state]],{{sfnm|1a1=Blundy|1a2=Lycett|1y=1987|1p=28|2a1=Simons|2y=2003|2p=102}} with many U.S. right-wingers believing that Gaddafi was a Marxist-Leninist in a close relationship with the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Haynes|1990|p=61}} Gaddafi's state has also been characterized as authoritarian.{{sfnm|1a1=Boyd-Judson|1y=2005|1p=78|2a1=Zoubir|2y=2009|2p=402}} His administration has also been criticized by political opponents and groups like [[Amnesty International]] for the [[human rights abuses]] carried out by the country's security services. These abuses included the repression of dissent, public executions, and the arbitrary detention of hundreds of opponents, some of whom reported being tortured.{{sfn|Simons|2003|pp=102–104}} One of the most prominent examples of this was a massacre that took place in [[Abu Salim prison]] in June 1996; [[Human Rights Watch]] estimated that 1,270 prisoners were massacred.<ref name="Human Rights Watch 1270">{{cite web|url= https://www.hrw.org/es/news/2009/10/16/libya-free-all-unjustly-detained-prisoners|title=Libya: Free All Unjustly Detained Prisoners|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=16 October 2009}}</ref>{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|pp=210–212}} Dissidents abroad were labelled "stray dogs"; they were publicly threatened with death and sometimes killed by government hit squads,{{sfnm|1a1=El-Khawas|1y=1984|1p=43|2a1=Blundy|2a2=Lycett|2y=1987|2pp=133–138|3a1=Vandewalle|3y=2008b|3p=27|4a1=St. John|4y=2012|4p=171}} or returned home by force to face imprisonment or death.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tsourapas|first=Gerasimos|date=26 January 2020|title=The long arm of the Arab state|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|language=en|volume=43|issue=2|pages=351–370|doi=10.1080/01419870.2019.1585558|s2cid=150568796|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/57897513/2019_LongArmArabState.pdf}}</ref>

Gaddafi's government's treatment of non-Arab Libyans came in for criticism from human rights activists, with native Berbers, Italians, Jews, refugees, and foreign workers all facing persecution in Gaddafist Libya.{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|pp=202–203, 209}} Human rights groups also criticized the treatment of migrants, including [[asylum seekers]], who passed through Gaddafi's Libya on their way to Europe.{{sfn|Zoubir|2009|p=409}} Despite his vocal opposition to colonialism, Gaddafi was criticized by some anti-colonial and leftist thinkers. The [[Political economy|political economist]] [[Yash Tandon]] stated that while Gaddafi was "probably the most controversial, and outrageously daring (and adventurous) challenger of the Empire" (i.e. Western powers), he had nevertheless been unable to escape the West's [[neo-colonialism|neo-colonial]] control over Libya.{{sfn|Tandon|2011|p=12}} During the Civil War, various leftist groups endorsed the anti-Gaddafist rebels—but not the Western military intervention—by arguing that Gaddafi had become an ally of Western imperialism by cooperating with the War on Terror and efforts to block African migration to Europe.{{sfn|Castro|2011|p=309}} Gaddafi's actions in promoting foreign militant groups, although regarded by him as a justifiable support for national liberation movements, was seen by the United States as interference in the domestic affairs of other nations and active support for international terrorism.{{sfn|St. John|1987|pp=82–83}} Gaddafi himself was widely perceived as a terrorist, especially in the US and UK.{{sfnm|1a1=Haynes|1y=1990|1p=58|2a1=Boyd-Judson|2y=2005|2p=91}}

Following his defeat in the civil war, Gaddafi's system of governance was dismantled and replaced by the interim government of the NTC, which legalized trade unions and freedom of the press. In July 2012, [[2012 Libyan General National Congress election|elections were held]] to form a new [[General National Congress]] (GNC), which officially took over governance from the NTC in August.
