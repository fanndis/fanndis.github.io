== Development ==
The goal of the Apple Watch was to complement an iPhone and add new functions, and to free people from their phones.<ref name="wired.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/04/the-apple-watch/|title=iPhone Killer: The Secret History of the Apple Watch|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> [[Kevin Lynch (computing)|Kevin Lynch]] was hired by Apple to make [[wearable technology]] for the wrist. He said: "People are carrying their phones with them and looking at the screen so much. People want that level of engagement. But how do we provide it in a way that's a little more human, a little more in the moment when you're with somebody?"<ref name="wired.com" /> Apple's development process was held under wraps until a [[Wired (website)|''Wired'']] article revealed how some internal design decisions were made.<ref name="wired.com" />

Rumors as far back as 2011 speculated that Apple was developing a wearable variation of the [[iPod]] that would curve around the user's wrist, and feature [[Siri]] integration.<ref name="imore-earlyrumors">{{cite web|title=Rumor: Apple working on wearable iPod with Siri control &#124; iMore|url=http://www.imore.com/apple-working-wearable-ipod-siri-control|website=[[iMore]]|access-date=September 1, 2015}}</ref> In February 2013, ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Apple was beginning to develop an [[iOS]]-based smartwatch with a curved display.<ref name="verge-earlyrumors">{{cite web|title=Apple is 'experimenting' with curved glass smartwatch, says NYT and WSJ|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/10/3973364/apple-rumored-to-be-developing-ios-based-smartwatch/in/4286985|website=[[The Verge]]|access-date=July 15, 2015}}</ref> That same month, ''[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]'' reported that Apple's smartwatch project was "beyond the experimentation phase" with a team of about 100 designers.<ref name="bloomberg-watchrumor">{{cite web|title=Apple Said to Have Team Developing Wristwatch Computer|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-12/apple-said-to-have-team-developing-wristwatch-computer|website=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]]|access-date=July 15, 2015}}</ref> In July 2013, ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported that Apple had begun hiring more employees to work on the smartwatch, and that it was targeting a retail release in late 2014.<ref name="verge-ftblitz">{{cite web|title=Apple on iWatch hiring blitz ahead of possible late 2014 launch, says Financial Times|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/14/4522898/apple-on-iwatch-hiring-blitz-and-could-launch-next-year-says/in/4286985|website=[[The Verge]]|access-date=July 15, 2015}}</ref>

The device was not branded as "iWatch" (which would put it in line with its pre-existing product lines such as iPod, iPhone, and [[iPad]]) because the inventor decided "Apple Watch" made more visionary sense than "iWatch," which would have followed previously-existing strategems; in the United States, the "iWatch" trademark is owned by OMG Electronics – who was [[crowdfunding]] a device under the same name, and is owned in the [[European Union]] by Irish firm Probendi.<ref name="cnet-iwatchname">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/non-apple-companies-hold-iwatch-trademark-in-u-s-u-k-china/|title=Non-Apple companies hold iWatch trademark in U.S., U.K., China|website=[[CNET]]|access-date=July 15, 2015}}</ref><ref name="cnbc-applewatchname">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/09/why-the-apple-watch-isnt-called-the-iwatch.html|title=Why the Apple Watch isn't called the iWatch|website=CNBC|publisher=[[NBCUniversal Television Group|NBCUniversal News Group]]|access-date=July 15, 2015}}</ref> In July 2015, Probendi sued Apple Inc. for [[trademark infringement]], arguing that through [[keyword advertising]] on the [[Google Search|Google search engine]], it caused advertising for the Apple Watch to appear on search results pages when users searched for the trademarked term "iWatch".<ref name="ars-iwatchlawsuit">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/07/the-apple-iwatch-doesnt-exist-but-a-legal-fight-over-it-does/|title=The Apple iWatch doesn’t exist, but a legal fight over it does|website=[[Ars Technica]]|access-date=July 15, 2015}}</ref>

Originally at launch, the Apple Watch was marketed through 3 "collections", with the case made out of different materials:
* Apple Watch Sport (Aluminium case)
* Apple Watch (Stainless steel case)
* Apple Watch Edition (Originally released as an 18kt gold casing with newer materials in later models)
Since Series 2, Apple dropped the "Sport" moniker from the branding (apart from the sport bands). "Apple Watch Edition" branding still exists.<ref>https://www.imore.com/apple-watch-series-2-unboxing</ref>

The Series 4 and Series 5 have been made available two sizes, {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|44|mm|in|abbr=on}}, replacing the {{convert|38|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|42|mm|in|abbr=on}} sizes of the original, Series 2, and Series 3 models.<ref name=Etienne>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17852388/apple-watch-series-4-dimensions-size-0-comparison-thick-iphone-event-2018 |title=Apple Watch Series 4 is thinner than previous models but bulkier than the original |last=Etienne |first=Stefan |website=[[The Verge]] |date=September 12, 2018 |access-date=September 28, 2019}}</ref><ref name=Wuerthele>{{cite web |url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/09/25/review-the-apple-watch-series-5-leaves-the-competition-in-the-dust |title=Review: The Apple Watch Series 5 leaves the competition in the dust |last1=Wuerthele |first1=Mike |last2=O'Hara |first2=Andrew |website=[[AppleInsider]] |date=September 25, 2019 |access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref> The design of the watch has not changed significantly since its release, so customizable bands and accessories are typically compatible with any Apple Watch of the same size, while {{convert|38|mm|in|abbr=on}} straps also fit {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} watches, and {{convert|42|mm|in|abbr=on}} straps fit {{convert|44|mm|in|abbr=on}} watches.<ref name=Steele>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/feature/364073/the-best-apple-watch-bands |last=Steele |first=Chandra |title=The Best Apple Watch Bands |date=October 2, 2018 |access-date=September 28, 2019 |website=[[PCMag]]}}</ref> The casing of the watch includes a mechanism to enable the straps to be interchangeable.

For input, the watch includes a "digital [[watch#Handedness|crown]]", which can be turned to scroll or zoom and pressed to return to the home screen, and a [[touchscreen]] that features [[Force Touch]] technology, which makes it pressure-sensitive and capable of distinguishing between a tap and a press.<ref name="ars-review" /> The watch also has a side button which can be used to display recently used apps and access [[Apple Pay]].<ref name=theverge2 /> Apple rates the device's battery for 18 hours of mixed usage.<ref name="ars-review"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humavox.com/blog/wearable-month-apple-watch/|title=Wearable of the Month: The Apple Watch|date=October 29, 2015|work=[[Humavox]]}}</ref> Apple Watch is charged by means of [[inductive charging]], using a cable similar to the [[MagSafe (Mac)|MagSafe]] cable from Apple's [[MacBook family]] of laptops.<ref name=theverge /> If the watch's battery depletes to less than 10 percent, the user is alerted and offered to enable a "power reserve" mode, which allows the user to continue to read the time for an additional 72 hours. The watch then reverts to its original mode when recharged.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/au/watch/battery.html|title=General Battery Information|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|access-date=April 11, 2015}}</ref>

Apple did not explicitly market the first generation Apple Watch as being [[waterproof]], stating that it can withstand splashes of water (such as rain and hand washing), but does not recommend submersion ([[IP code|IPX7]]). Apple introduced a higher level of water resistance with the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, and the device was explicitly advertised as being suitable for swimming and surfing.<ref name="apple" />

===Bands===
Apple Watch comes with an included band (strap) to attach it to the user's wrist, which can be easily changed to other types. Third party bands are compatible with Apple Watch, however Apple produces bands in a variety of materials and colours which are updated each season. The most recent update to the colours occurred in March 2020. Bands designed for the 38mm and 42mm cases are completely compatible with the 40mm and 44mm cases respectively.

Starting with Apple Watch Series 5, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Studio which allows customers to mix and match bands, eliminating the need to purchase a specific combination and allows for a simplification of packaging (since Series 4).

====Sport band====
Originally designed to be shipped exclusively with the original Apple Watch Sport, the sport band is made of fluoroelastomer with a pin‑and‑tuck closure. Made for an active lifestyle and for its durability, it was originally available in five colours including green, yellow, pink, white. A black colour was also produced which only shipped with the space grey case. The sport band can be purchased in 2 different sizes, S/M and M/L.

====Classic Buckle====
A leather strap which is reminiscent of traditional wrist watch straps including a metal buckle and fastener, available in a range of colours including black and brown.

====Modern Buckle====
A leather band which uses a quick release mechanism to attach the strap to the wrist and is designed to wrap symmetrically around the wrist.

====Leather loop====
Made from Venezia leather, the quilted fit of the strap, which has a series of hidden magnets in it, allows it to be infinitely adjustable. The strap is designed to attach to itself in a loop fashion and can be worn snug to the user's wrist.

====Milanese loop====
Reminiscent of mesh watch straps from more premium brands of watches, the Milanese loop is made of stainless steel with a magnetic fastener. It is infinitely adjustable making it suitable for a variety of wrist sizes.

====Woven Nylon====
Discontinued band which was similar to the 'classic buckle' band but made from nylon.

====Sport loop====
Introduced alongside the Apple Watch Series 3, the sport loop is made of nylon and features a hook and loop closure to secure the watch to the wrist. It is quick-fastening and designed for fitness as it is marketed as being breathable and lightweight. It is worn similarly to the leather and Milanese loop bands and is infinitely adjustable.

====Link bracelet====
The most expensive band available for purchase from Apple, the link bracelet mirrors high-end watch bands and includes a butterfly closure for fastening to the wrist. It contains more than 100 components and is made from the same [[stainless steel]] [[alloy]] as the Apple Watch case. For a larger fit, 6 additional links can be purchased separately, which can be installed using a simple release button.

====Nike Sport Band and Sport Loop====
The Nike Sport band is the signature band which ships with Apple Watch Nike Series 2 and later. It is made from fluoroelastomer, however it has compression-moulded perforations for breathability. The perforations often have a contrasting colour in them.

Similar in fit and wear to the normal sport loop, the Nike sport loop bands contain a reflective thread which shimmers when light strikes it. Although both Nike bands are designed to complement the Nike Apple Watch, they can also be purchased separately.

====Solo Loop and Braided Solo Loop====
Announced alongside the Apple Watch Series 6 and Apple Watch SE, the Solo Loop and Braided Solo Loop have no buckles or clasps. Both loops, stated by Apple as being compatible with Series 4 and above plus Watch SE, come in 12 sizes and a variety of colors. However, only six of the sizes are compatible with all watches that are otherwise compatible—the three smallest sizes are incompatible with a 44 mm case, while the three largest are incompatible with a 40 mm case.

==Software==
Apple Watch runs [[watchOS]], whose interface is based around a home screen with circular app icons. The OS can be navigated using the touchscreen or the crown on the side of the watch.<ref name="ars-review"/> During its debut, the first generation Apple Watch needed to be paired with an [[iPhone 5]] or later running [[iOS 8.2]] or later; this version of iOS introduced the Apple Watch app, which is used to pair the watch with an iPhone, customize settings and loaded apps, and highlight compatible apps from the App Store.<ref name="ars-review">{{cite web|title=Review: The absolutely optional Apple Watch and Watch OS 1.0|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/05/review-the-absolutely-optional-apple-watch-and-watch-os-1-0/|website=Ars Technica|access-date=July 15, 2015}}</ref>

The Apple Watch is capable of receiving notifications, messages, and phone calls via a paired iPhone.<ref name="ars-review"/> "Glances" allowed users to swipe between pages containing [[software widget|widget-like]] displays of information; however, this feature was replaced by a new Control Center. watchOS also supports [[iOS 8#Continuity|Handoff]] to send content from Apple Watch to an iOS or macOS device,<ref name="ars-review"/> and act as a [[Electronic viewfinder|viewfinder]] for an iPhone camera,<ref name=theverge2>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6107091/apple-watch-iphone-6-most-important-things|title=The Verge: The 15 most important announcements from the Apple Watch, iPhone 6 event|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=September 9, 2014|access-date=September 10, 2014}}</ref> [[Siri]] is also available for voice commands, and is capable of responding with voice prompts on the Series 3 watches.<ref name="ars-review" /> Apple Watch also supports [[Apple Pay]], and enables its use with older iPhone models that do not contain [[near-field communication]] (NFC) support.<ref name="ars-review" />

Apple Watch's default apps are designed to interact with their iOS counterparts, such as [[Apple Mail|Mail]], Phone, Calendar, [[iMessage|Messages]], [[Apple Maps|Maps]], Music, [[Photos (Apple)|Photos]], Reminders, Remote (which can control [[iTunes]] and [[Apple TV]]), Stocks, and [[Apple Wallet|Wallet]].<ref name="ars-review" /> Using the Activity and Workout apps, a user can track their physical activity and send data back to the iPhone for use in its Health app and other [[HealthKit]]-enabled software.<ref name="ars-review" /> With watchOS 3, Reminders, Home, Find My Friends, Heart Rate, and Breathe were added to the stock apps.

With the release of watchOS 4 and the Series 3 Apple Watch, iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c support was dropped, requiring users to use an [[iPhone 5s]] or later with iOS 11 or later to use watchOS 4. Apple Watches still running watchOS 3 or below remain compatible with the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. Further, watchOS 5 dropped support for the original (Series 0) Apple Watch.<ref>{{cite web |title=watchOS 5 Preview |url=https://www.apple.com/watchos-preview/ |website=[[Apple Inc.]] |access-date=June 14, 2018}}</ref> watchOS 6 requires iOS 13, and was the final version to support the Series 1 and Series 2 Apple Watch. watchOS 7 requires iOS 14.

===Version history===
{{See also|WatchOS#Version_history|l1=watchOS version history}}

At [[WWDC]] 2015, Tim Cook announced watchOS 2.0; described by ''[[CNET]]'' as a "significant revamp", it included a new [[software development kit]] that allows more direct access to the device's hardware, new watch faces, the ability to reply to an e-mail, and other features.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Get ready for Apple Watch 2.0|url = https://www.cnet.com/news/get-ready-for-apple-watch-2-0/|website = [[CNET]]|access-date = June 10, 2015}}</ref> WatchOS 2.0 was released in September 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cunningham|first1=Andrew|title=After delay, Apple releases watchOS 2.0 to the public|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2015/09/after-delay-apple-releases-watchos-2-0-to-the-public/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|access-date=September 21, 2015|date=September 21, 2015}}</ref> Following the software update, some users experienced issues with lag.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/393831/why-im-cheating-on-my-apple-watch/|title=Why I’m cheating on my Apple Watch |website=Cult of Mac|access-date=March 13, 2016}}</ref>

watchOS 3.0 was announced at WWDC 2016, with a priority on performance. Users are able to keep apps running in memory as well as receive background updates and refreshed information. Other updates include a new Dock invoked with the side button to replace the performance-laden Glances, an updated Control Center, and new reply options on Messages. Several new watch faces have also been added, including [[Minnie Mouse]], along with the ability to switch watch faces from the lock screen simply by swiping. A new feature called SOS allows users to hold the dock button to make a call to the local emergency line and pull up the user's Medical ID. Another feature is Activity Sharing, which allows sharing of workouts with friends and even sending their heartbeats to one another. A new app called Breathe guides users through breathing exercises throughout the day, with visuals and haptic feedback. It was made available to the public in September 2016.

watchOS 3.1 was released to the public in October 2016, and watchOS 3.2 was released in March 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/24/apple-releases-watchos-3-1-to-the-public-with-bug-fixes-update-through-iphone-watch-app/|title=Apple Releases watchOS 3.1 to the public with bug fixes, update through iPhone Watch app|website=[[9to5Mac]]|access-date=May 27, 2017}}</ref> Both updates added minor improvements and bug fixes.

WatchOS 4.0 was announced at WWDC 2017 and released to the public in September 2017. WatchOS 4 features a proactive Siri watch face, personalized activity coaching, and an entirely redesigned music app. It also introduces GymKit, a technology platform to connect workouts with cardio equipment.

WatchOS 4.3 was released in March 2018. It introduced support for Nightstand mode in portrait orientation. It brought back the ability for music playing on the iPhone to be controlled using the Music app on the Apple Watch and also enabled control of playback and volume on Apple's HomePod. Other new features included a new charging animation and a new app loading animation. Activity data was added to the Siri watch face, and the battery complication more accurately reports battery life.

watchOS 5.0 was first shown to the public at the San Jose WWDC developer conference held by Apple. It introduced an instant watch-to-watch walkie-talkie mode, all-new Podcasts app, raise-wrist-to-speak Siri, customizable Control Center, and the ability to access the notification center and control center from apps. Other features included support for WebKit to view web pages, six new watch faces, and new workout running features.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/17/watchos-5-features/|title=watchOS 5 for Apple Watch now available with Podcasts and Walkie-Talkie apps, much more|date=September 17, 2018|work=[[9to5Mac]]|access-date=November 18, 2018}}</ref> It was released to the public in September 2018.<ref>[https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-watch-4-rumors-launch-features-leaks-specs-price-release-date-reports-bigger-display/ Apple Watch Series 4 starts at $399, packs larger displays and EKG sensor - CNET<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  On the newest release of watchOS beta the sleep feature was shown on screen, this would eliminate the need to use third-party apps.

watchOS 6.0 was released to the public in September 2019. It introduced more native iOS apps such as voice memos, calculator, and a native watchOS app store. watchOS 6.0 also introduced new features such as the noise app that allows you to measure the sound around you in decibels, menstrual tracking, and new watch faces. Other features include Siri being able to tell users what music they are listening to, activity trends, and a new UI framework for developers.

watchOS 7.0 was announced in 22 June 2020 at the WWDC, and released on September 16th, 2020; new functionalities include sleep tracking, additional watch faces, handwashing detection and new workouts such as dancing.<ref name="appleWatchOS7" />

===Third-party apps===
In watchOS 1, third-party [[WatchKit]] applications run in the background on the iPhone as an application extension while a set of native user interface resources are installed on Apple Watch.<ref name=ArsTechnica>{{cite web|last1=Cunningham|first1=Andrew|title=Apple releases WatchKit developer tools alongside first iOS 8.2 beta|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/11/apple-releases-watchkit-developer-tools-alongside-first-ios-8-2-beta/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|access-date=May 15, 2015|date=November 18, 2014}}</ref> Thus, watchOS apps must be bundled within their respective iOS app, and are synced to the watch either manually, or automatically upon installation of the phone app.<ref name="ars-review"/> 

With the release of watchOS 2, Apple made it mandatory for new watch apps to be developed with the watchOS 2 SDK from June 1, 2016 onwards; no third-party languages or SDKs can be used to develop apps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/04/22/apple-requires-all-new-watchos-apps-be-native-by-june-1|title=Apple requires all new watchOS apps be native by June 1|date=April 22, 2016|website=AppleInsider|access-date=May 15, 2017}}</ref> This allowed for developers to create native apps that are run on the watch itself, thus improving the responsiveness of third-party apps.

In watchOS 5 and earlier, all watchOS apps are dependent apps - the watchOS app relies on an iOS companion app in order to function properly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Creating Independent watchOS Apps - Apple Developer Documentation|url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/creating_independent_watchos_apps#overview|website=Apple Developer|access-date=September 20, 2020}}</ref> However, in watchOS 6 or later, developers are able to create completely independent watchOS apps, and no longer require an app to be installed on the paired iPhone. This was assisted by the introduction of a separate App Store on the Apple Watch itself.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Abent|first1=Eric|url=https://www.slashgear.com/apple-watch-independent-apps-cut-out-the-iphone-03578919/|title=Apple Watch independent apps cut out the iPhone|date=June 3, 2019|website=SlashGear|access-date=September 20, 2020}}</ref>

[[File:AppleWatchAppleStore3.jpg|thumb|right|An Apple Store showcase with various Apple Watch models]]
As of September 2020, seven generations and seven series of Apple Watch have been released.

Apple Watch models have been divided into five "collections": Apple Watch (1st gen-present), Apple Watch Sport (1st gen), Apple Watch Nike+ (Series 2-present), Apple Watch [[Hermès]] (1st gen-Series 5, Series 6-present), and Apple Watch Edition (1st gen-Series 3, Series 5, Series 6-present). They are differentiated by combinations of cases, bands, and exclusive watch faces; Apple Watch comes with either aluminum or stainless steel cases, and various watch bands (only stainless steel was offered for Apple Watch 1st gen); Apple Watch Sport came with aluminum cases and sport bands or woven nylon bands; Apple Watch Nike+ comes with aluminum cases and Nike sport bands or sport loops; Apple Watch [[Hermès]] uses stainless steel cases and Hermès leather watch bands (also included is an exclusive Hermès orange sport band); and Apple Watch Edition came with ceramic cases and various bands (the 1st gen Apple Watch Edition used 18&nbsp;karat yellow or rose gold).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phonearena.com/news/Apple-Watch-Edition-price-to-start-at-5000_id60775|title=Apple Watch: 18-Karat Gold Premium Smartwatch Edition To Be Priced At $5000|date=September 17, 2014}}</ref> With the Series 5, the Edition tier was expanded with a new titanium case.<ref name=":1" />

As of Series 3, each Apple Watch model in aluminum, the least expensive casing, is available either with or without [[LTE (telecommunications)|LTE]] [[cellular connectivity]], while the models with the other casing materials available (stainless steel and sometimes ceramic and titanium) always include it.<ref name=Gil>{{cite web |url=https://www.imore.com/apple-watch-cellular-vs-gps-whats-difference |title=Apple Watch Cellular vs GPS: What's the difference? |website=[[iMore]] |date=September 15, 2020 |last=Gil |first=Lory |access-date=September 19, 2020}}</ref><ref name=Song2019>{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/apple-watch-series-3 |title=Apple Watch Series 3 Review |last=Song |first=Victoria |date=October 16, 2019 |access-date=September 19, 2020 |website=[[PCMag.com]]}}</ref>

Each model through Series 3 comes in a 38- or 42-millimeter body, with the larger size having a slightly larger screen and battery.<ref name="ars-review" /> The Series 4 has been updated to 40- and 44-millimeter models, respectively. Each model has various color and band options. Featured Apple-made bands include colored sport bands, sport loop, woven nylon band, classic buckle, modern buckle, leather loop, Milanese loop, and a link bracelet.<ref name="ars-review" />

Many reviewers described the watch as functional and convenient, while also noting failure to offer as much potential functionality as preceding smartphones. Farhad Manjoo of ''[[The New York Times]]'' mentioned the device's steep learning curve, stating it took him "three long, often confusing and frustrating days" to become accustomed to watchOS 1, but loved it thereafter.<ref name="NYT review">{{cite web|last1=Manjoo|first1=Farhad|title=Apple Watch Review: Bliss, but Only After a Steep Learning Curve|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/technology/personaltech/apple-watch-bliss-but-only-after-a-steep-learning-curve.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 25, 2015|date=April 8, 2015}}</ref> Some reviewers also compared it to competing products, such as [[Android Wear]] devices, and claimed "The Smartwatch Finally Makes Sense".<ref name="WSJ">{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-watch-review-the-smartwatch-finally-makes-sense-1428494495|title=Apple Watch Review: The Smartwatch Finally Makes Sense|last1=Fowler|first1=Geoffrey|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=April 8, 2015|access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref> Reviewers had mixed opinions on battery life though, with Geoffrey Fowler of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' saying "the battery lives up to its all-day billing, but sometimes just barely,"<ref name="WSJ" /> and others compared it to the [[Samsung Gear 2]], which "strolls through three days of moderate usage."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Luke|title=Samsung Gear 2: Apps, Battery, Value and Verdict |url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/samsung-gear-2-review-apps-battery-value-and-verdict-page-3|website=[[Trusted Reviews]]|access-date=April 9, 2015|quote=It strolled through three days moderate usage, which is two full days longer than the Galaxy Gear, but's still short of what we would like to see on a wearable.}}</ref> Tim Bradshaw of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' used several applications over a period of days.

When using the Apple Watch, some users have reported issues using the heart monitoring feature due to permanent skin conditions including [[tattoos]]. The Watch uses photoplethysmography technology (PPG) which utilizes the green LED lights to measure heart rates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://exist.io/blog/fitness-trackers-heart-rate/|title=How do fitness trackers measure your heart rate?|last=Cooper|first=Belle|date=February 21, 2016}}</ref> To gauge a user's heart rate, the watch flashes green light from the LEDs at the skin and records the amount of this light that is absorbed by the red pigment of the blood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/30/how-tattoogate-has-highlighted-a-wider-problem-with-wearables|title=How #tattoogate has highlighted a wider problem with wearables|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=April 30, 2015}}</ref> However, under certain circumstances the skin may not allow for the light absorption to be read properly and thus provide inaccurate results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204666 |title=Your heart rate.
