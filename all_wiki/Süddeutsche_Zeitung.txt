The '''''Süddeutsche Zeitung''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈzyːtˌdɔʏtʃə ˈtsaɪtʊŋ|}}; German for ''South German Newspaper''), published in [[Munich]], [[Bavaria]],<ref name=gh/> is one of the largest daily [[newspaper]]s in Germany.

==History==
On 6 October 1945,<ref name=ess>{{cite web|title=Media Landscape Media Claims|url=http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/docs/round6/methods/ESS6_media_landscape_media_claims_ed_02_0.pdf|work=European Social Survey|access-date=12 January 2015|date=May 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816014141/http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/docs/round6/methods/ESS6_media_landscape_media_claims_ed_02_0.pdf|archive-date=16 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Sigurd Hess|title=German Intelligence Organizations and the Media|journal=Journal of Intelligence History|date=2009|volume=9|issue=1-2|doi=10.1080/16161262.2009.10555166}}</ref> five months after the end of [[World War II]] in Germany, the ''SZ'' was the first newspaper to receive a license from the [[United States Armed Forces|US military]] administration of Bavaria. The first issue was published the same evening, allegedly printed from the same (repurposed) presses that had printed ''Mein Kampf''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zerofsky|first1=Elisabeth|title=How a German Newspaper Became the Go-To Place for Leaks Like the Paradise Papers|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-a-german-newspaper-became-the-go-to-place-for-leaks-like-the-paradise-papers|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=11 November 2017|date=11 November 2017}}</ref> The first article begins with:

:For the first time since the collapse of the [[Nazi Germany|brown rule of terror]], a newspaper run by Germans is published in Munich. It is limited by the political necessities of our days, but it is not bound by censorship, nor gagged by constraints of conscience.

Declines in ad sales in the early 2000s was so severe that the paper was to the brink of bankruptcy in October 2002. The Süddeutsche survived through a 150 million euro investment by a new shareholder, a regional newspaper chain called Südwestdeutsche Medien. Over a period of three years, the newspaper underwent a reduction in its staff, from 425, to 307, the closing of a regional edition in Düsseldorf, and the scrapping of a section devoted to news from Berlin.<ref>Mark Landler (19 January 2004), [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/19/business/media-woes-at-two-pillars-of-german-journalism.html MEDIA; Woes at Two Pillars of German Journalism] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

In spring 2004, ''SZ'' launched the ''Süddeutsche Bibliothek''. Each week, one of 50 famous novels of the 20th century was made available in hardcover at certain newsstands and in book shops. Later a series of 50 influential movies on DVD followed. In late 2004 the daily also launched a [[popular science]] magazine, ''SZ Wissen''.<ref name=eweb>{{cite web|title=New trend in Germany: scientific magazines by Die Zeit and Süddeutsche Zeitung|url=http://wef.blogs.com/editors/2004/12/new_trend_in_ge_1.html|work=Editors Weblog|accessdate=5 October 2013|date=3 December 2004}}</ref> In late 2005 a series of children's books continued this branch of special editions.

In early 2015, the newspaper received a 2.6-[[terabyte]] data set from an anonymous source. The dataset contained confidential information of a law firm offering the management of offshore companies. The newspaper in conjunction with the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] reviewed the data from the ''[[Panama Papers]]'' for over a year before publishing stories from it on 3 April 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Panama Papers. The secrets of dirty money|url=http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/articles/56febff0a1bb8d3c3495adf4/|accessdate=3 April 2016|date=April 2016}}</ref>

In the late 2017, the newspaper released snippets from a 1.4-[[terabyte]] data set to be known as the ''[[Paradise Papers]]'' containing about 13.4 million documents, throwing light on the financial offshore jurisdictions, whose workings are unveiled, including Bermuda, the HQ of the main company involved, [[Appleby (law firm)|Appleby]], corporate services provider Estera, corporate registries in Caribbean and Singapore-based international trust and corporate services provider, [[Asiaciti Trust]]. It contains the names of more than 120,000 people and companies.<ref>"[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41877932 Paradise Papers: Your guide to four years of offshore revelations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107042727/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-41877932 |date=7 November 2017 }}".</ref> The newspaper called in the ''International Consortium of Investigative Journalists'' to oversee the investigation. BBC Panorama and The Guardian are among the nearly 100 media groups investigating the papers. The leaked data covers seven decades, from 1950 to 2016.<ref>"[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-41880153 Paradise Papers: Everything you need to know about the leak] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109071826/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-41880153 |date=9 November 2017 }}".</ref>

==Profile==
The paper, often abbreviated ''SZ'', is read throughout Germany by 1.1 million readers daily and boasts a relatively high circulation abroad. The editorial stance of the newspaper is [[Liberalism|liberal]] and generally of [[centre-left]],<ref name=spiegelonline/><ref name=koopmans/> leading some to joke that the ''SZ'' is the only opposition in the state of [[Bavaria]], which has been governed by the conservative [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] almost continuously since 1949. In the [[German election, 2013|2013 elections]] the paper was among the supporters of the [[SPD]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Juan P.

''SZ'' is published in [[Newspaper format|Nordisch format]].<ref name=adsm/>

==Contents==

===Sections===
The national edition features four sections: Politics, Culture, Economy and Sports. Editions sold in Munich and its surrounding counties include local news inserts.

The ''SZ'' is well known for its daily frontpage column ''Streiflicht'' (searchlight) of 72 lines, which is published anonymously.

===Supplements===
*SZ Magazin (Friday), a magazine supplement
*Wochenende (Saturday), featuring longer articles and short stories for the weekend.
*TV listings (Tuesday) and an event guide (Thursday) are only included in the Bavarian edition.

===Articles in English===
Between 2004 and 2017, ''SZ'' published a weekly supplement containing articles in English from ''[[The New York Times]]''.

===Website===
Süddeutsche.de (formerly sueddeutsche.de) is the newspaper's website. It contains articles from the paper's own online staff, articles that originally appeared in the print version of the paper and agency reports. The paper's first incarnation on the web was launched on the paper's 50th anniversary.  It was called "SZonNet". The project was directed by Hella Schmitt of the SZ Text Archive (now DIZ - Documentation and Information Center Munich). Initially, it had no journalistic staff of its own, it simply used content from the print edition. Oliver Bantle, from SZ Science came up with ideas for publishing original science content online in 1996. The content went online in the fall of that year with Angelika Jung-Huettl as editor. Editorial responsibility lay with the then leader of SZ Science, Martin Urban. In the spring of 1998, travel-related content began to be published online. Wenke Hess originated the concept and implemented it as an editor.

''Süddeutsche.de'' employs 25 journalists.

==Notable writers==
Some of Germany's best-known journalists either work for the ''SZ'' or spent considerable parts of their careers working for the paper. [[Heribert Prantl]], head of the national desk, is a lawyer by education, a former public prosecutor, and the most cited author of editorial commentaries in German press. [[Hans Leyendecker]] is one of Germany's best known [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalists]]. Leyendecker formerly worked for the magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', unveiling various political and economic scandals, such as the widespread illegal party financing during the 1980s, and that of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] in 1999. He also unveiled the smuggling of Russian [[plutonium]] into Germany with the help of the foreign intelligence service ''[[Bundesnachrichtendienst]]'' in 1994, bribery at arms deals, the [[German Visa Affair 2005]] and corruption of the staff council at [[Volkswagen]].  Another well-known journalist working for the ''SZ'' was [[Rudolph Chimelli]], a political reporter who was working for the paper from 1 January 1957 to his death in 2016.

[[Martin Süßkind]] also worked with the ''SZ'' and eventually became the editor of the ''[[Berliner Zeitung]]''. [[Giovanni di Lorenzo]], who was responsible for the ''SZ'''s full page [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''Seite 3'' (Page 3) from 1994 to 1998, and who was later editor-in-chief of the ''[[Tagesspiegel]]'', also worked for the paper. He is now editor-in-chief of the weekly German newspaper ''[[Die Zeit]]''.

The investigative reporters [[Frederik Obermaier]] and [[Bastian Obermayer]] in 2016 initiated and coordinated the worldwide [[Panama Papers]] revelations.

==Controversy==
In May 2018, the German Press Council opened an inquiry to determine whether a ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' cartoon which depicted Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] was anti-Semitic; readers had complained that the image "reminded them of the anti-Semitic language of Nazi times." ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' ended its decades-long collaboration with the cartoonist and apologized to readers, calling the cartoon a mistake.<ref>Riham Alkousaa (May 18, 2018), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-antisemitism-cartoon/german-newspaper-drops-cartoonist-after-netanyahu-drawing-idUSKCN1IJ1MT German newspaper drops cartoonist after Netanyahu drawing] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>
