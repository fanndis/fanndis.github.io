He contributed to periodicals such as ''New Crisis'', ''Public Utilities Fortnightly'', and ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''.

In 2003 he visited the University of Washington, Seattle, to speak on reparations. At the time several of the majority-Black audience asked him how much money could potentially be wrought from reparations. While Ogletree would not elaborate on a particular number he seemed to support an audience member's suggestion of more than $2&nbsp;trillion or more.

In February 2011, he gave a three-part lecture at [[Harvard Law School]] entitled "Understanding Obama", which provides an inside look at President Barack Obama's journey from boyhood in Hawaii to the White House.<ref>[http://lawdawghall.blogspot.com/2012/04/understanding-obama-conundrum-of-race.html Charles Ogletree. ''Understanding Obama Lecture Series'']. W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African American Research. 2011. Retrieved April 17, 2012</ref> 

Ogletree appears in the 2013 documentary film, ''[[Justice is a Black Woman: The Life and Works of Constance Baker Motley]]'' and in the 2014 documentary, ''[[Hate Crimes in the Heartland]]'', providing an analysis of the [[Tulsa Race Riots]].

==Stature and public life==
Ogletree taught both [[Barack Obama|Barack]] and [[Michelle Obama]] at Harvard; he has remained close to Barack Obama throughout his political career.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135952/http://www.hlrecord.org/2.4475/interview-ogletree-on-obama-1.577513  Interview with Ogletree on his relationship with the Obamas] in the ''[[Harvard Law Record]]''</ref> He appeared briefly on the joint ''[[The Daily Show]]''-''[[Colbert Report]]'' election night coverage of the 2008 presidential election, making a few remarks about his personal knowledge of the Obamas.

Ogletree has written opinion pieces on the state of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] in the United States for major publications.<ref name="REP">{{cite news |first= Charles |last= Ogletree |title= The Case for Reparations |url= http://www.usaweekend.com/02_issues/020818/020818reparations.html |archive-url = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021113010242/http://www.usaweekend.com/02_issues/020818/020818reparations.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= November 13, 2002 |work= USA Weekend |date= August 18, 2002 |accessdate= September 3, 2006}}</ref> Ogletree also served as the moderator for a panel discussion on civil rights in baseball on March 28, 2008, that accompanied the second annual [[Major League Baseball]] [[Civil Rights Game|civil rights exhibition game]] the following day between the [[New York Mets]] and the [[Chicago White Sox]].<ref>[http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/story/10510543 Chicago White Sox, Major League Baseball, New York Mets&nbsp;— CBSSports.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120910031019/http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/story/10510543 |date=September 10, 2012 }}</ref>

On July 21, 2009, Ogletree issued a statement in response to the arrest of his Harvard colleague and client, Professor [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], whose arrest at his own home became a major news story about the nexus of politics, police power, and race that summer.<ref>[http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/20090721harvards_ogletree_slams_colleagues_cuffing/srvc=home&position=also – Police were out of line].</ref> Professor Ogletree later wrote a book about the events titled ''The Presumption of Guilt: The Arrest of Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Race, Class and Crime in America''.

After the September 2009 death of Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], Ogletree's name was suggested as one of the possible appointees to Kennedy's seat as a "placeholder" until a special election could be held. Other names rumored to be in contention were [[Michael Dukakis]] and several people who had held important Massachusetts or national Democratic positions: [[Paul G. Kirk]] (a former chair of the [[Democratic National Committee]]), [[Nick Littlefield]] (a former Kennedy chief of staff), [[Robert Travaglini]], and [[Shannon O'Brien]].<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090918/ap_on_re_us/us_kennedy_successor U.S. Kennedy Successor], September 18, 2009.

He is a founder of the Benjamin Banneker Charter Public School (www.banneker.org) and serves on the school's foundation board. The school library is named in his honor.

On July 13, 2016, a Tweet on Ogletree's Twitter account (@CharlesOgletree) linked to a website of the [[Harvard Law School#Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice|Charles Hamilton Houston Institute]] stating that Ogletree had recently been diagnosed with early-stage [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>https://charleshamiltonhouston.org/news/2016/07/ogletree/</ref>

==Plagiarism==
In 2004 Harvard disciplined Ogletree for the [[plagiarism]] of six paragraphs from [[Yale]] scholar [[Jack Balkin]]'s book, ''What Brown v. Board of Education Should Have Said'' in his own book, ''All Deliberate Speed: Reflections on the First Half-Century of Brown v.
