'''''Love Songs''''' is the third [[compilation album]] by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] [[girl group]] [[Destiny's Child]], released on January 25, 2013 through [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="iTunes US">{{cite web|title=Love Songs by Destiny's Child|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/love-songs/id592197418|publisher=[[iTunes]], Apple, Inc.|accessdate=January 25, 2013}}</ref><ref name="iTunes UK">{{cite web|title=Love Songs by Destiny's Child|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/love-songs/id592197418|publisher=[[iTunes]], Apple, Inc.|accessdate=January 25, 2013}}</ref> The album differs from their first two compilations in that it features mostly album-only selections as well as the newly recorded song "Nuclear", the first original song from Destiny's Child since the group disbanded in 2005. The album cover is based on the single artwork from the band's 2004 single "[[Lose My Breath]]".

Apart from "Nuclear", the rest of the album consists of assorted previously recorded music, which Knowles, Rowland and Williams handpicked.<ref name="VF" /><ref name="NuclearMTV" /> Williams said that ''Love Songs'' was made "for the fans", and told [[MTV News]] about recording the "Nuclear" track, "It was a bunch of fun. It was just picking up right where we left off. The harmonies and just us stacking [vocals] ... Beyoncé laid hers first, then I'd go and lay another note to the bottom, and I'm like, 'Wow, this is dope.'

Upon its release, the public reaction to "Nuclear" was mixed. According to [[MTV News]], "Those saying "no, no, no" called it too mid-tempo, underwhelming even, for an act that built its catalog on power anthems like "[[Survivor (Destiny's Child song)|Survivor]]." But supporters fell hard for the drum-heavy Pharrell production."<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Rebecca|title=Destiny's Child Love Songs: Four Key Tracks!|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1700950/destinys-child-love-songs-key-tracks.jhtml|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=February 3, 2013|date=January 29, 2013}}</ref> [[Consequence of Sound]]'s Amanda Koellner gave ''Love Songs'' a mixed review, noting that its material highlights "the group’s knack for harmony and emotion" and it is "a shot of [[nostalgia]]", but isn't an "essential collection".<ref name="COS">{{cite web|last=Koellner|first=Amanda|title=Album Review: Destiny's Child – Love Songs|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/02/album-review-destinys-child-love-songs/|publisher=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=February 3, 2013|date=February 1, 2013}}</ref> Sarah Rodman of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' was displeased with the lack of new material, calling the album "unnecessary" in the "digital world of playlist-making". Although, Rodman did praise "Nuclear" as a "modestly appealing trifle that features quasi-scientific nonsense about 'when two become one on a quantum level' and benefits from all the slow jam somnambulance preceding it by being slightly more alert."<ref>{{cite web|last=Rodman|first=Sarah|title=Not much new on Destiny's Child's 'Love Songs'|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2013/01/28/review-love-songs-destiny-child/umBgaG6AHpJt45L8ttrQJP/story.html|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=February 3, 2013|date=January 28, 2013}}</ref>

Jim Farber of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' said the album's ballads which "didn't flatter Destiny's core persona" sounded like "extended runs rather than fully honed tunes." Farber, who had given the album an overall score of three out of five stars, went on to praise their "rich" vocal performances, writing "the way the voices of Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams wrap around Beyoncé’s — encouraging ever higher flights, while jazzing up each other’s runs — proves this wasn’t just a one-woman show".<ref name="NY Daily">{{cite web|last=Farber|first=Jim|title=Album review: Destiny's Child, 'Love Songs'|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/album-review-destiny-child-love-songs-article-1.1245960|work=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=Daily News, L.P.|accessdate=February 3, 2013|date=January 27, 2013}}</ref>

Andy Kellman of [[Allmusic]] described the collection as "a sharp selection of deep album cuts, including one from Kelly Rowland's Simply Deep ("Heaven"), that demonstrates the group's depth behind the hits". Kellman gave particular praise to "Nuclear", calling it a "knockout" and writing, "it sounds more like something released in 1990 by the Chimes, Soul II Soul, or the Family Stand than any pop-R&B circa 2013".<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Kellman|title=Love Songs – Destiny's Child|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/love-songs-mw0002460473|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=February 25, 2013|date=January 29, 2013}}</ref>
