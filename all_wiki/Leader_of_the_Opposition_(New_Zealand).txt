{{Politics of New Zealand}}

In New Zealand, the '''leader of the Opposition''' (or '''Opposition leader''') is a senior politician who commands the support of the [[Official Opposition (New Zealand)|Official Opposition]]. The leader of the Opposition by [[constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]] heads the largest party not supporting the government: usually this is the [[parliamentary leader]] of the second-largest [[caucus]] in the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref name="glossary">{{cite web |title=Glossary |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/glossary/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=12 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref> When in the [[debating chamber]] the Opposition leader sits on the left-hand side of the centre table, in front of the Opposition and opposite the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]].<ref name="NZ_Parliament_People">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/HowPWorks/People/0/a/f/0afe831bd86b4c03b92cc769806bdb3b.htm|title=People in Parliament|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=21 January 2009}}</ref>

The role of the leader of the Opposition dates to the late 19th century, with the first [[political parties in New Zealand|political parties]], and the office was formally recognised by statute in 1933. Although currently mentioned in a number of statutes, the office is not established by any [[Act of Parliament|Act]] (nor is that of the prime minister); it is simply a product of the conventions of the [[Westminster system|Westminster]]-style [[parliamentary system]]. The leader of the Opposition is paid a special salary by virtue of the office.

Typically the leader of the Opposition is elected by his or her party according to its rules. A new leader may be elected when the incumbent dies, resigns, or is challenged for the leadership. [[Judith Collins]] of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] has [[Shadow Cabinet of Judith Collins|served]] as leader since 14 July 2020,<ref name="Collins">{{cite web |title=Judith Collins announced as new National Party leader |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/07/judith-collins-announced-as-new-national-party-leader-source.html |author=Sadler, Rachel |publisher=Newshub |accessdate=14 July 2020 |date=14 July 2020}}</ref> following the resignation of [[Todd Muller]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Todd Muller resigns as National Party leader|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/421152/todd-muller-resigns-as-national-party-leader|accessdate=14 July 2020|work=RNZ|date=14 July 2020|language=en-NZ}}</ref>

==Role==
{{Further|Official Opposition (New Zealand)}}
The term "[[Parliamentary opposition|opposition]]" has a specific meaning in the parliamentary sense; it is an important component of the Westminster system, with the Official Opposition directing criticism at the [[New Zealand Government|Government]].  The leader of the Opposition leads a [[Shadow Cabinet (New Zealand)|Shadow Cabinet]], which scrutinises the [[policies]] and actions of the [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] led by the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]], as well as offer alternative policies.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Relationship between the Government and the Opposition or Minority Parties in Selected Places|url=http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr02-03/english/sec/library/0203rp01e.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=13 November 2002}}</ref> The Opposition leader may be viewed as a prime minister in waiting.<ref name="parliament"/><ref>{{cite web|title=The Leader of the Opposition|url=https://moad-web.s3.amazonaws.com/heracles-production/9cb/910/701/9cb910701cb595cbad60721a77acd1108fafea80fc2680d480ce022bf4ed/54-opposition-leaders-c8faa0656.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2018}}</ref> He or she is expected to be ready to form a new government if the incumbent government is unable to continue in office.

There are several ways in which the leader of the Opposition participates directly in affairs of state. Often, these relate to national security matters, which are supposed to transcend party politics – the [[New Zealand Security Intelligence Service]], for example, is required to brief the leader of the Opposition as well as the prime minister on certain matters of [[national security]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzsis.govt.nz/about/|title=Overview|publisher=NZSIS|accessdate=21 January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104055731/http://www.nzsis.govt.nz/about/|archivedate=4 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Salary==
The leader of the Opposition receives a higher salary than other members of the Opposition, being paid the same amount as a [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] Minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10544218|title=Bill English admits pay rise 'a bit embarrassing'|date=21 November 2008|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=21 January 2009}}</ref> {{As of|2016|alt=As at 2016}} the Leader of the Opposition's salary is NZ$288,900.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Salaries and Allowances Determination 2016|url=https://www.parliament.nz/media/3151/parliamentary-salaries-and-allowances-determination-2016.pdf|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=2016}}</ref><ref name="radionz"/> In addition, like all other members of parliament, the leader of the Opposition receives annual allowances for travel and lodging.

==History==
For much of the country's early history, the role was not a formal one. For most of the 19th century, there was rarely any one person who could be identified as ''the'' leader of the Opposition. Prominent members were sometimes informally dubbed as "Leader of the Opposition" – often facetiously by rival politicians.<ref name="parliament">{{cite web |title=Chapter 8 Parties and Government |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/parliamentary-practice-in-new-zealand/chapter-8-parties-and-government |website=www.parliament.nz |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=18 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> It was only when the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] was formed that any unified leadership appeared in Parliament, and the role of Opposition leader is generally traced from this point. [[John Ballance]], leader of the Liberals (and later [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|premier]]) is usually considered the first leader of the Opposition in the modern sense.<ref name="parliament"/>

When Ballance led the Liberals into government in 1891, they faced no formal opposition in a party sense, though certain MPs were styled leader of the Opposition. Their opponents gradually coalesced around a leader, [[William Massey]], who became Opposition leader in 1903, and in 1909 became the first parliamentary leader of the new [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform Party]].<ref name="Massey">{{cite web |editor-last=McLintock |editor-first=Alexander Hare |last=Gardner |first=William James |title=MASSEY, William Ferguson |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/1966/massey-william-ferguson |website=[[An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=18 April 2020 |language=en |date=1966}}</ref> For the first time, an Opposition party came forward as an alternative government.<ref name="Massey"/> After this, the leader of the Opposition would always be the parliamentary leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives that had not undertaken to support the government of the day.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

One notable exception to this was during [[World War I]], when the opposition Liberal Party accepted the governing Reform Party's offer to form a wartime coalition. Prime Minister Massey also extended the offer to the new [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] who rejected it. This made Labour the largest party not in government, however their leader [[Alfred Hindmarsh]] was not officially recognised as the leader of the Opposition. [[Joseph Ward]], who became deputy prime minister in the wartime cabinet, still retained the title, albeit in name only.<ref name="DNZB Ward">{{DNZB|Bassett|Michael|2W9|Ward, Joseph George|2 February 2016||Michael Bassett}}</ref>

During the 1910s and 1920s, the role of Opposition alternated between the Liberal and Reform parties. However, the rise of the Labour Party in the 1920s, together with a gradual weakening in support for the Liberals, led to a three-party situation by the mid-1920s, with the Labour and Liberal parties having a similar number of seats. After the [[1925 New Zealand general election|1925 election]] there was no official leader of the Opposition until [[Rex Mason]] of Labour won the seat of [[Eden (New Zealand electorate)|Eden]] in the [[1926 Eden by-election|by-election]] held on 15 April 1926. Labour superseded the Liberals as the official opposition and their leader [[Harry Holland]] became Opposition leader.<ref name="DNZB Holland">{{DNZB|O'Farrell|Patrick|authorlink=Patrick O'Farrell|3h32|Holland, Henry Edmund - Biography|2 February 2016}}</ref>

The [[1928 New Zealand general election|1928 general election]] put the [[United Party (New Zealand)|United Party]] (a remnant of the Liberals) in government for the last time. Reform then became the Opposition, however in 1931 Reform entered into [[United–Reform coalition Government of New Zealand|coalition with the Liberals]], and Labour then became the Official Opposition, despite being the third party. The unity of the coalition, culminating in the formation of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] in 1936, created a stable two-party system, with National and Labour alternating between Government and Opposition for much of the remainder of the century.

===Modern office===
The office was first officially recognised by an [[Act of Parliament]] in 1933, when a special allowance was conferred on the holder.<ref name="parliament"/>

With the [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|introduction of]] the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) [[Electoral system of New Zealand|voting system]], first used in the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 general election]], the nature of parliamentary opposition has changed. Now, though the leader of the largest non-Government party still becomes the leader of the Opposition, there will usually be several parties who are "in opposition". An example of this arose after the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 general election]], when the National Party gained only 27 seats – less than half the 58 seats held by opposition parties. This prompted calls from a number of parties, notably [[New Zealand First]] and the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]], for the abolition or reform of the post. It was argued by these parties that the position had become an "anachronism" in the modern [[multi-party system|multi-party]] environment, and that the days of a united opposition bloc were gone. However, with the revival of the National Party in the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 general election]], a more traditional relationship between Government and Opposition has been restored. According to Parliamentary Services, the leader of the Opposition formally represents and speaks for all parties that are outside Government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/who-s-who-in-parliament/ |title=Who's who in Parliament? |accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref>
