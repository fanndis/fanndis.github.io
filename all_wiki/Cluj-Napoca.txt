==Etymology==
[[File:Tiperit en Klus.JPG|thumb|left|Romanian inscription of a religious book: "Tiperit en Klus en Anul Domnului 1703" (Translation: "Printed in Klus in the year of our Lord 1703").]]

On the site of the city was a [[List of ancient cities in Thrace and Dacia|pre-Roman settlement]] named ''Napoca''. After the AD 106 [[Roman Dacia|Roman conquest of the area]], the place was known as ''Municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napoca''. Possible etymologies for ''Napoca'' or ''Napuca'' include the names of some [[Dacian tribes]] such as the ''Naparis'' or ''Napaei'', the Greek term ''napos'' (νάπος), meaning "timbered valley" or the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European root]] ''*snā-p-'' ([[Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch|Pokorny]] 971-2), "to flow, to swim, damp".<ref name="etim-napoca">Lukács 2005, p.14</ref>

The [[Hungarian language|Hungarian form]] ''Kolozsvár'', first recorded in 1246 as ''Kulusuar'', underwent various [[phonetic change]]s over the years (''uar'' / ''vár'' means "castle" in Hungarian); the variant ''Koloswar'' first appears in a document from 1332.<ref name="szabadsag2">{{cite web|url=http://www.szabadsag.ro/archivum/2003/08/3aug-04.htm |last=Asztalos |first=Lajos |title=Kolozsvár neve |publisher=Szabadság |date=4 August 2003 |accessdate=2008-03-15 |language=Hungarian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207090427/http://www.szabadsag.ro/archivum/2003/08/3aug-04.htm |archivedate=7 December 2008}}</ref> Its [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] name ''Clusenburg''/''Clusenbvrg'' appeared in 1348, but from 1408 the form ''Clausenburg'' was used.<ref name="szabadsag2" /> The [[Romanian language|Romanian name]] of the city used to be spelled alternately as ''Cluj'' or ''Cluș'',<ref name="etim-dict">{{cite web|url=http://dictionar.referinte.transindex.ro/index.php3?action=betu&betu=k&kezd=60&co=nemet |title=Dicționar de localități din Transilvania |last=Szabó |first=Attila m. |accessdate=2008-03-15 |language=Romanian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822094410/http://dictionar.referinte.transindex.ro/index.php3?action=betu&betu=k&kezd=60&co=nemet |archivedate=22 August 2010 }}</ref> the latter being the case in [[Mihai Eminescu]]'s ''Poesis''.

==History==
{{Main|History of Cluj-Napoca|Timeline of Cluj-Napoca}}

===Roman Empire===
[[File:Part of Tabula Peutingeriana centered around present day Transylvania.png|thumb|text-top|upright=1.5|Napoca on the [[Roman Dacia]] fragment of the 1st–4th century AD [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] (upper center){{sfn|Bunbury|1879|p=516}}]]
The [[Roman Empire]] conquered [[Dacia]] in AD 101 and 106, during the rule of [[Trajan]], and the Roman settlement Napoca, established thereafter, is [[Milliarium of Aiton|first recorded on a milestone]] discovered in 1758 in the vicinity of the city.<ref name="roman">Lazarovici ''et. al.'' 1997, pp. 202–03 (6.2 Cluj in the Old and Ancient Epochs)</ref> Trajan's successor [[Hadrian]] granted Napoca the status of ''[[municipium]]'' as ''municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napocenses''. Later, in the 2nd century AD,<ref>Lazarovici et al. 1997, p. 17 (2.7 Napoca romană)</ref> the city gained the status of a ''[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' as ''Colonia Aurelia Napoca''. Napoca became a provincial capital of [[Dacia Porolissensis]] and thus the seat of a [[promagistrate|procurator]]. The ''colonia'' was evacuated in 274 by the Romans.<ref name="roman" /> There are no references to urban settlement on the site for the better part of a millennium thereafter.<ref>Brubaker et al. 2006, p.89</ref>

===Middle Ages===

At the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]], two groups of buildings existed on the current site of the city: the wooden fortress at [[Mănăștur|Cluj-Mănăștur]] (''Kolozsmonostor'') and the civilian settlement developed around the current ''Piața Muzeului'' (Museum Place) in the city centre.<ref name="medieval" /><ref name="alicu">Alicu 2003, p.9</ref> Although the precise date of the conquest of Transylvania by the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] is not known, the earliest Hungarian artifacts found in the region are dated to the first half of the 10th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Madgearu|first=Alexandru|title=Românii în opera Notarului Anonim|year=2001|isbn=973-577-249-3|publisher=Centrul de Studii Transilvane, Fundația Culturală Română|location=Cluj-Napoca}}</ref> In any case, after that time, the city became part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

In the autumn of 1918, as World War I drew to a close, Cluj became a centre of revolutionary activity, headed by [[Amos Frâncu]].

===Climate===
Cluj-Napoca has a [[continental climate|warm-summer continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Dfb). The climate is influenced by the city's proximity to the [[Apuseni Mountains]], as well as by urbanisation. Some West-Atlantic influences are present during winter and autumn. Winter temperatures are often below {{convert|0|C|F|0}}, even though they rarely drop below {{convert|-10|C|F|0}}. On average, snow covers the ground for 65 days each winter.<ref>{{cite web

Although average [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[humidity]] during summer is low, there are infrequent yet heavy and often violent storms. During spring and autumn, temperatures vary between {{convert|13|C|F|0}} to {{convert|18|C|F|0}}, and precipitation during this time tends to be higher than in summer, with more frequent yet milder periods of rain.

Because of the last years' massive urban development, in 2005 some areas of Cluj were named as districts (Sopor, Borhanci, Becaș, Făget, Zorilor South), but most of them are still construction sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.primariaclujnapoca.ro/phcl/7-10-2005/27.aspx|title=Hotărâre privind propuneri de atribuire denumiri strazi si cartiere in municipiul Cluj-Napoca|year=2005|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Cluj-Napoca City Hall|language=Romanian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302004936/http://www.primariaclujnapoca.ro/phcl/7-10-2005/27.aspx |archivedate=2 March 2008}}</ref> Beside these, there are some other building areas like ''Tineretului'', ''Lombului'' or ''Oser'', which are likely to become districts in the following years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftr.ro/emil-boc-il-sfideaza-pe-tariceanu-892.php|title=Emil Boc îl sfidează pe Tăriceanu|date=7 June 2007|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Foaia Transilvană|language=Romanian|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729013944/http://www.ftr.ro/emil-boc-il-sfideaza-pe-tariceanu-892.php|archivedate=29 July 2008}}</ref>

Additionally, as Cluj-Napoca is the capital of [[Cluj County]], the city hosts the palace of the prefecture, the headquarters of the [[county council]] (''consiliu județean'') and the [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]], who is appointed by Romania's central government.<ref name="law-admin" /> The prefect is not allowed to be a member of a political party, and his role is to represent the national government at the local level, acting as a liaison and facilitating the implementation of National Development Plans and governing programmes at the local level.<ref name="law-admin" /> Like all other local councils in Romania, the Cluj-Napoca local council, the county council and the city's mayor are elected every four years by the population.<ref name="law-admin" />

Cluj-Napoca is also the capital of the historical region of [[Transylvania]], a status that resonates to this day. Currently, the city is the largest in the [[Nord-Vest (development region)|Nord-Vest development region]], which is equivalent to [[NUTS-II]] regions in the [[European Union]] and is used by the European Union and the Romanian Government for statistical analysis and regional development. The Nord-Vest development region is not, however, an administrative entity.<ref name="law-admin" /> The [[Cluj-Napoca metropolitan area]] became operational in December 2008,<ref name="ziua-metropola" /> and comprises a population of 411,379.<ref name="INSSE-Cluj-2011-analiza" /><ref name="periurban" /> Besides Cluj-Napoca, it includes seventeen [[Communes of Romania|communes]]: [[Aiton, Cluj|Aiton]], [[Apahida]], [[Baciu]], [[Bonțida]], [[Borșa, Cluj|Borșa]], [[Căianu]], [[Chinteni]], [[Ciurila]], [[Cojocna]], [[Feleacu]], [[Florești, Cluj|Florești]], [[Gârbău, Cluj|Gârbău]], [[Gilău, Cluj|Gilău]], [[Jucu]], [[Petreștii de Jos]], [[Tureni]] and [[Vultureni, Cluj|Vultureni]].

In order to counterbalance the political influence of Transylvania's Hungarian minority, nationalist Romanians in Transylvania founded the [[Party of Romanian National Unity]] (PUNR) at the beginnings of the 1990s; the party was present in the Romanian Parliament during the 1992–1996 legislature.<ref name="punr">{{cite web|url=http://www.punr.ro/istoric.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041014191152/http://www.punr.ro/istoric.htm|archivedate=14 October 2004|title=History of PUNR|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Partidul Unității Națiunii Române|language=Romanian}}</ref> The party eventually moved its main offices to Bucharest and fell into decline as its leadership joined the ideologically similar [[Greater Romania Party|PRM]].<ref name="punr" /> In 2008, the ''Institute for Research on National Minorities'', subordinated to the [[Romanian Government]], opened its official headquarters in Cluj-Napoca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=1760|title=Institutul minorităților se înființează la Cluj|date=3 August 2007|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Ziua de Cluj|language=Romanian|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321123616/http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=1760|archivedate=21 March 2008}}</ref>

Eleven hospitals function in the city, nine of which are run by the county and two (for oncology and cardiology) by the [[Ministry of Public Health (Romania)|health ministry]].

===Justice system===
Cluj-Napoca has a complex judicial organisation, as a consequence of its status of [[Cluj County|county]] capital. The Cluj-Napoca Court of Justice is the local judicial institution and is under the purview of the Cluj County Tribunal, which also exerts its jurisdiction over the courts of [[Dej]], [[Gherla]], [[Turda]] and [[Huedin]].<ref name="lege-jude">{{cite web

The city also hosts the county's commercial and military tribunals.<ref name="lege-jude" />

Cluj-Napoca has its own municipal police force, ''Poliția Municipiului Cluj-Napoca'', which is responsible for policing of crime within the whole city, and operates a number of special divisions. The Cluj-Napoca Police are headquartered on Decebal Street in the city centre (with a number of precincts throughout the city) and it is subordinated to the [[Romanian Police|County's Police Inspectorate]] on Traian Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politiaromana.ro/legea_politiei.htm|title=Law no. 218 / 23 April 2002: Law on the organisation and work of the Romanian Police|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Parliament of Romania|language=Romanian}}</ref> City Hall has its own community police force, ''Poliția Primăriei'', dealing with local community issues.

Also notorious was the case of serial killer [[Romulus Vereș]], "the man with the hammer"; during the 1970s, he was charged with five murders and several [[attempted murder]]s, but never imprisoned on [[Insanity defense|grounds of insanity]]: he suffered from [[schizophrenia]], blaming the [[Devil]] for his actions. Instead, he was institutionalised in the Ștei psychiatric facility in 1976, following a three-year [[forensic]] investigation during which four thousand people were questioned. [[Urban myth]]s brought the number of victims up to two hundred women, though the actual number was much smaller. This confusion is probably explained by the lack of attention this case received, despite its magnitude, in the Communist press of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clujeanul.ro/cluj/citeste-povestea-celui-mai-temut-criminal-al-clujului-omul-cu-ciocanul-2394295|title=Citește povestea celui mai temut criminal al Clujului: "Omul cu ciocanul"|date=17 February 2008|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Clujeanul|language=Romanian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301111548/http://www.clujeanul.ro/cluj/citeste-povestea-celui-mai-temut-criminal-al-clujului-omul-cu-ciocanul-2394295|archive-date=1 March 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A 2006 poll shows a high degree of satisfaction with the work of the local police department.

Efforts made by local authorities in the Cluj-Napoca district at the end of the 1990s to reform the protection of [[children's rights]] and assistance for [[street children]] proved insufficient due to lack of funding, incoherent policies and the absence of any real collaboration between the actors involved (Child Rights Protection Directorate, Social Assistance Service within the District Directorate for Labour and Social Protection, Minors Receiving Centre, Guardian Authority within the City Hall, Police). There are numerous street children, whose poverty and lack of documented identity brings them into constant conflict with local law enforcement.<ref name="report-street-children">{{cite web|url=http://www.streetchildren.org.uk/reports/Romania%20JJ%20report%20-%20FINAL%204.04.doc|title=Street Children and Juvenile Justice in Romania|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher="Asociația pentru Sprijinirea Integrării Sociale" (ASIS) in partnership with "The Consortium for Street Children"|format=DOC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627181914/http://www.streetchildren.org.uk/reports/Romania%20JJ%20report%20-%20FINAL%204.04.doc |archivedate=27 June 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Following cooperation between the local governmental council and the [[Prison Fellowship]] Romania Foundation, [[homeless]] people, street children and [[beggar]]s are taken, identified and accommodated within the Christian Centers for Street Children and Homeless People, respectively, and the Ruhama centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.primariaclujnapoca.ro/acte-necesare/acte69.aspx|title=Acte necesare – Persoane fără adăpost|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Primăria Municipiului Cluj-Napoca|language=Romanian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317231110/http://www.primariaclujnapoca.ro/acte-necesare/acte69.aspx |archivedate=17 March 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The latter features a marshaling center for beggars and street children, as well as a [[flophouse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.primariaclujnapoca.ro/acte-necesare/acte70.aspx |title=Acte necesare – Azilul de noapte|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Cluj-Napoca City Hall|language=Romanian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013081853/http://primariaclujnapoca.ro/acte-necesare/acte70.aspx |archivedate=13 October 2007}}</ref> As a consequence, the fluctuating movement of children, beggars and homeless people in and out of the centre has been considerably reduced, with most of the initial beneficiaries successfully integrated into the programme rather than returning to the streets.<ref name="report-street-children" />

From 2000 onwards, Cluj-Napoca has seen an increase in illegal [[streetracing|road races]], which occur mainly at night on the city's outskirts or on industrial sites and occasionally produce victims. There have been attempts to organize legal races as a solution to this problem.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/cursele-de-masini-pe-timp-de-noapte-intra-in-legalitate/123606|author=Călina Berceanu|title=Cursele de mașini pe timp de noapte intră în legalitate|newspaper=Adevărul|date=7 April 2005|accessdate=2008-03-14|language=Romanian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302091609/http://www.adevarul.ro/articole/cursele-de-masini-pe-timp-de-noapte-intra-in-legalitate/123606 |archivedate=2 March 2008}}</ref>

The city's population, at the 2011 census, was 324,576 inhabitants,<ref name="population-2002" /> or 1.6% of the total population of Romania. The population of the [[Cluj-Napoca metropolitan area]] is estimated at 411,379.<ref name="INSSE-Cluj-2011-analiza" /><ref name="metro" /> As defined by [[Eurostat]], the Cluj-Napoca [[functional urban area]] has a population of 379,733 residents ({{as of|2015|lc=y}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/cities/data/database |title=Population on 1 January by age groups and sex – functional urban areas |accessdate=29 October 2017 |publisher=[[Eurostat]]}}</ref> Finally, the population of the peri-urban area numbers over 420,000 residents.<ref name="INSSE-Cluj-2011-analiza" /><ref name="periurban" /> The new [[Cluj-Napoca metropolitan area|metropolitan government of Cluj-Napoca]] became operational in December 2008.<ref name="ziua-metropola" /> According to the 2007 data provided by the County Population Register Service, the total population of the city is as high as 392,276 people.<ref name="flotanti" /> The variation between this number and the census data is partially explained by the real growth of the population residing in Cluj-Napoca, as well as by different counting methods: "In reality, more people live in Cluj than those who are officially registered", Traian Rotariu, director of the Center for Population Studies, told ''Foaia Transilvană''.<ref name="flotanti" /> Moreover, this number does not include the floating population—an average of over 20 thousand people each year during 2004–2007, according to the same source.<ref name="flotanti" />

In the modern era, Cluj's population experienced two phases of rapid growth, the first in the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the [[Communist Romania|Communist period]], when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people [[Urbanization|migrated from rural areas]] and from beyond the Carpathians to the county's capital.<ref>Brubaker et al. 2006, p.112</ref> About two-thirds of the population growth during this era was based on [[Net migration rate|net migration]] inflows; after 1966, the date of Ceaușescu's ban on abortion and contraception, [[natural increase]] was also significant, being responsible for the remaining third.<ref name=industrialisation />

From the [[Middle Ages]] onwards, the city of Cluj has been a multicultural city with a diverse cultural and religious life. According to the 2011 Romanian census, of those for whom data are available, 81.5% of the population of the city are [[Romanians|ethnic Romanians]], with the second largest ethnic group being the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], who make up 16.4% of the population. The remainder is composed of [[Romani people|Romani]] (1.1%), [[ethnic German|Germans]] (0.18%), [[Jews]] (0.05%) and others (0.7%). (Those for whom data were unavailable accounted for 7.1%.)<ref name="INSSE-etnie-2011" /> Today, the city receives a large influx of migrants: 25,000 people requested residence in the city during 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftr.ro/wanted-clujeanul-verde-2898.php|title=Wanted: Clujeanul verde|date=6 March 2008|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Foaia Transilvană|language=Romanian|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511000054/http://www.ftr.ro/wanted-clujeanul-verde-2898.php|archivedate=11 May 2008}}</ref>

In terms of religion, among those for whom there were data, 71.3% of the population in 2011 were [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] and 10.6% were [[Reformed Church in Romania|Reformed]]. The [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholic]] and the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Romanian Greek-Catholic]] communities claimed 5.0% and 4.7% of the population respectively, while other religious groups like [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] (2.7%), [[Baptist Union of Romania|Baptists]] (1.2%), or [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarians]] (1.0%) rounded out most of the rest.

In Transylvania as a whole, the Reformation sharpened ethnic divisions: Saxons became Lutheran while Hungarians either remained Catholic or became Calvinist or Unitarian.

[[File:Cluj-Napoca Central Park-statue 01.jpg|thumb|Fountain in the [[Cluj-Napoca Central Park|Central Park]]]]
Cluj-Napoca has a number of landmark buildings and monuments. One of those is the [[St. Michael's Church, Cluj-Napoca|Saint Michael's Church]] in [[Unirii Square, Cluj-Napoca|''Unirii'' Square]], built at the end of the 14th century in the [[gothic art|Gothic style]] of that period. It was only in the 19th century that the [[Neo-Gothic]] tower of the church was erected; it remains the tallest church tower in Romania to this day.<ref name="sf-mihail">Lukács 2005</ref>

In front of the church is the [[Matthias Corvinus Monument|equestrian statue of Matthias Corvinus]], erected in honour of the locally born [[Kingdom of Hungary|King of Hungary]]. The [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church's]] equivalent to St. Michael's Church is the [[Dormition of the Theotokos Cathedral, Cluj-Napoca|Orthodox Cathedral]] on [[Avram Iancu Square, Cluj-Napoca|''Avram Iancu'' Square]], built in the [[interwar]] era. The [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Romanian Greek-Catholic Church]] also has a cathedral in Cluj-Napoca, [[Transfiguration Cathedral, Cluj-Napoca|Transfiguration Cathedral]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Another landmark of Cluj-Napoca is the [[Palace of Justice, Cluj-Napoca|Palace of Justice]], built between 1898 and 1902, and designed by architect Gyula Wagner in an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] style.<ref name="palat-justitie">{{cite web|url=http://portal.just.ro/InstantaPrezentare.aspx?idInstitutie=117|title=Prezentare instanță|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Cluj Tribunal|language=Romanian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408092230/http://portal.just.ro/InstantaPrezentare.aspx?idInstitutie=117|archivedate=8 April 2008}}</ref> This building is part of an ensemble erected in Avram Iancu Square that also includes the National Theatre, the Palace of [[Căile Ferate Române]], the Palace of the Prefecture, the Palace of Finance and the Palace of the Orthodox Metropolis.

Many of the city's notable figures are buried in Hajongard Cemetery, which covers {{convert|14|ha|acre}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

As an important cultural centre, Cluj-Napoca has many theatres and museums. The latter include the [[National Museum of Transylvanian History]], the [[Ethnographic Museum of Transylvania|Ethnographic Museum]], the [[Cluj-Napoca Bánffy Palace|Cluj-Napoca Art Museum]], the Pharmacy Museum, the Water Museum and the museums of [[Babeș-Bolyai University]]—the University Museum, the Museum of Mineralogy, the Museum of Paleontology and Stratigraphy, the Museum of Speleology, the Botanical Museum and the Zoological Museum.

===Visual arts===
[[File:Place Avram Iancu & Theatre National, Cluj-Napoca.jpg|thumb|210px|right|[[Avram Iancu Square, Cluj-Napoca|Avram Iancu Square]]]]

In terms of [[visual arts]], the city contains a number of galleries featuring both classical and contemporary Romanian art, as well as selected international works.

The [[Bánffy Palace|National Museum of Art]] is located in the former palace of the count György Bánffy, the most representative secular construction built in the [[Baroque]] style in [[Transylvania]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cluj4all.com/adrese/istorie,18/obiective-istorice,60/palatul-banffy-sec.-xviii,711/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106061512/http://www.cluj4all.com/adrese/istorie,18/obiective-istorice,60/palatul-banffy-sec.-xviii,711/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-11-06|title=Palatul Bánffy|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Cluj4all.com|language=Romanian}}</ref><ref>Lukács 2005, pp.83–5</ref><ref>Pascu 1957, p.63</ref> The museum features extensive collections of Romanian art, including works of artists like [[Nicolae Grigorescu]], [[Ștefan Luchian]] and [[Dimitrie Paciurea]], as well as some works of foreign artists like [[Károly Lotz]], [[Luca Giordano]], [[Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin]], [[Herri met de Bles]] and [[Claude Michel]],<ref>{{cite web

The most notable of the city's other galleries is the ''Gallery of the Union of Plastic Artists''. Situated in the city centre, this gallery presents collections drawn from the contemporary arts scene. The Gallery of Folk Art includes traditional Romanian interior decoration artworks.

Historically, the city was one of the most important cultural and artistic centres in 16th-century Transylvania. The Renaissance workshop, formed in 1530 and strongly supported by the Transylvanian princes, served local and wider requirements: from the middle of the century onwards, when the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] had [[Battle of Mohács|conquered]] central Hungary, it extended its activity throughout the new principality. Its style, the "Flower Renaissance", used a variety of plant ornament enriched with coats of arms, figures and inscriptions. It continued to be of great importance into the 18th century, and traces of it are still apparent in 20th-century vernacular art; Klausenburg was central to the long, anachronistic survival of the style, particularly among Hungarians.<ref name="Grove" />

===Performing arts===
[[File:Teatrul National din Cluj cu afise.JPG|thumb|[[Lucian Blaga National Theatre]]]]
The city has a number of renowned facilities and institutions involving [[performing arts]].

These three clubs are classified as the top three clubs in the Transylvania-Banat region in a chart published by the national daily ''[[România Liberă]]''.<ref name="cluburi" /> The Unirii area also features the ''Fashion Bar'', with an exclusive terrace sponsored by [[Fashion TV]]. Some other clubs in the centre are Aftereight, Avenue, Bamboo, Decadence, Kharma and Molotov Pub. Numerous restaurants, pizzerias and coffee shops provide regional as well as international cuisine; many of these offer cultural activities like music and fashion shows or art exhibitions.<ref name="Dezbatere" />

The city also includes [[Strada Piezișă]] (''slanted street''), a central nightlife strip located in the Hașdeu student area, where a large number of bars and terraces are situated. Cluj-Napoca is not limited to these international music genres, as there are also a number of [[discothèque|discos]] where local "[[Lăutari]]" play [[manele]], a Turkish-influenced type of music.

==Architecture==
Cluj-Napoca's salient architecture is primarily [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. The modern era has also produced a remarkable set of buildings from the [[Mid-century modern|mid-century style]]. The mostly utilitarian Communist-era architecture is also present, although only to a certain extent, as Cluj-Napoca never faced a large [[systematization (Romania)|systematisation]] programme. Of late, the city has seen significant growth in contemporary structures such as skyscrapers and office buildings, mainly constructed after 2000.<ref name="iaim">{{cite web|url=http://www.iaim.ro/catedre/istorie_teorie_restaurare/note/APA/2-2-1-arh-mod-rom.doc|title=Arhitectura perioadei moderne pe teritoriul României|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher="Ion Mincu" Architecture University|language=Romanian|format=DOC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408202135/http://www.iaim.ro/catedre/istorie_teorie_restaurare/note/APA/2-2-1-arh-mod-rom.doc |archivedate=8 April 2008}}</ref>

===Historical architecture===
[[File:Palatul BanffyCJ.JPG|thumb|[[Bánffy Palace]]]]
[[File:Palatul Széki, Cluj.jpg|thumb|[[Széki Palace, Cluj-Napoca|Széki Palace]]]]
The nucleus of the old city, an important cultural and commercial centre, used to be a military camp, attested in documents with the name "castrum Clus".

[[File:CatedralaSfMihail (32).JPG|thumb|left|[[Iuliu Maniu Street, Cluj-Napoca|Iuliu Maniu Street]]: construction of this symmetrical street was undertaken during the 19th century.]]

The oldest residence in Cluj-Napoca is the [[Matthias Corvinus House, Cluj-Napoca|Matthias Corvinus House]], originally a Gothic structure that bears Transylvanian [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] characteristics due to a later renovation.<ref>Lazarovici et al. 1997, p.56 (3.2 Monumente medievale)</ref> Such changes feature on other Hungarian townspeople's residences, built from the mid-15th century mostly of stone and wood with a cellar, ground floor and upper storey, in the Late Gothic and Renaissance styles; although the late medieval houses have often been considerably altered, the street façades of the old town are mostly preserved.<ref name="Grove">{{cite web
|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T018268|title=Cluj-Napoca|year=2008|accessdate=2008-10-10|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> [[St. Michael's Church, Cluj-Napoca|St. Michael's Church]], the oldest and most representative Gothic-style building in the country, dates back to the 14th century. The oldest of its sections is the altar, dedicated in 1390, while the newest part is the clock tower, which was built in [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style (1860).<ref name="sf-mihail" />

As Renaissance styles survived late in the city, the appearance of Baroque art was also delayed, but from the mid-18th century Klausenburg was once again at the centre of the development and spread of art in Transylvania, as it had been two centuries earlier. The first enthusiasts for Baroque were the Catholic Church and the landed aristocracy. Artists came initially from south Germany and Austria, but by the end of the century most of the work was by local craftsmen. The earliest signs of the new style appear in the furnishings of St. Michael's church: the altarpieces and pulpit, which date to the 1740s, are carved, painted and richly decorated with figures. An altarpiece depicting the ''[[Adoration of the Magi in art|Adoration of the Magi]]'' (1748–50) is the work of [[Franz Anton Maulbertsch]]. The [[Cluj-Napoca Piarists' Church|earliest two-towered Baroque church]] was built by the Jesuits from 1718 to 1724 on the pattern of [[Košice]] and was later handed over to the Piarists. During the century more simply designed Baroque churches were built for the mendicant orders, Lutherans, Unitarians and the Orthodox Church. The noble families built houses and even palaces in the old town.<ref name="Grove" /> The Baroque [[Bánffy Palace]] (1774–1785), constructed around a rectangular yard, is the masterpiece of Eberhardt Blaumann. Its peculiarity lies in the appearance of the principal façade.<ref name="iaim" />

Both [[Avram Iancu Square, Cluj-Napoca|Avram Iancu]] and [[Unirii Square, Cluj-Napoca|Unrii Squares]] feature ensembles of [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] and [[baroque]]–[[rococo]] architecture, including the [[Palace of Justice, Cluj-Napoca|Palace of Justice]],<ref name="palat-justitie" /> the [[Cluj-Napoca National Theatre|Theatre]],<ref name="teatru" /> the [[Iuliu Maniu Street, Cluj-Napoca|Iuliu Maniu symmetrical street]],<ref name="maniu-street" /> and the New York Palace, among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=9446|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130113214106/http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=9446|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 January 2013|title=Cum va arăta viitorul "Conti"|date=26 February 2008|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Ziua de Cluj|language=Romanian}}</ref> In the 19th century many houses were built in the Neo-classical, Romantic and Eclectic styles. Also dating to that period are the [[Church with the Two Towers|two-towered Neo-classical Calvinist church]] (1829–50), its new college building of 1801, and the City Hall (1843–46) in the marketplace, by [[Antal Kagerbauer]].<ref name="Grove" />

The banks of the Someșul Mic also feature a wide variety of such old buildings. The end of the 19th century brought a building ensemble that fastens the corners of the oldest bridge over the river, at the north end of the [[Regele Ferdinand Avenue, Cluj-Napoca|Regele Ferdinand Avenue]]. The Berde, Babos, Elian, Urania, and [[Széki Palace, Cluj-Napoca|Széki]] palaces consist of a mixture of Baroque, Renaissance and Gothic styles, following the [[Art Nouveau]]/Secession and Revival specifics.<ref>Alicu et al. 1995, p.30</ref>
[[File:Canalul Morilor, Cluj-Napoca.JPG|thumb|right|The 17th century Canalul Morii]]
In the 2000s, the old city centre underwent extensive restoration works, meant to convert much of it into a pedestrian area, including [[Eroilor Avenue, Cluj-Napoca|Bulevardul Eroilor]], [[Unirii Square, Cluj-Napoca|Unirii Square]] and other smaller streets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/a98147/schimbarea-la-fata-a-centrului-clujului.html|title=Schimbarea la față a centrului Clujului|date=14 June 2007|accessdate=2008-03-12|newspaper=România Liberă|language=Romanian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228061239/http://www.romanialibera.ro/a98147/schimbarea-la-fata-a-centrului-clujului.html|archive-date=28 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In some residential areas of the city, particularly the high-income southern areas, like ''Andrei Mureșanu'' or ''Strada Republicii'', there are many [[fin-de-siecle|turn-of-the-century]] villas.

===Modern and Communist architecture===

[[File:Blocks Cluj-Napoca.jpg|thumb|Blocks of flats in central Cluj-Napoca]]

Part of Cluj-Napoca's architecture is made up of buildings constructed during the [[Communist Romania|Communist era]], when historical architecture was replaced with "more efficient" high-density apartment blocks. Nicolae Ceaușescu's project of [[Systematization (Romania)|systematisation]] did not really affect the heart of the city, instead reaching the marginal, shoddily built districts surrounding it.<ref name="iaim" />

Still, the centre hosts some examples of modern architecture dating back to the Communist era. The Hungarian Theatre building was erected at the beginning of the 20th century, but underwent an avant-garde renovation in 1961, when it acquired a [[modernist architecture|modernist style of architecture]].<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.huntheater.ro/oldal.php?soid=9&mm=11&sl=7|title=Detailed technical description|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Hungarian Theatre of Cluj}}</ref> Another example of modernist architectural art is ''Palatul Telefoanelor'', situated in the vicinity of [[Michael the Brave|Mihai Viteazul]] Square, an area that also features a complex of large apartment buildings.

Some outer districts, especially [[Mănăștur]], and to a certain extent [[Gheorgheni, Cluj-Napoca|Gheorgheni]] and [[Grigorescu, Cluj-Napoca|Grigorescu]], consist mainly of such large apartment ensembles.<ref name="iaim" />

===Contemporary architecture===

{{Main|Contemporary architecture in Cluj-Napoca}}
Since 1989, modern skyscrapers and glass-fronted buildings have altered the skyline of Cluj-Napoca. Buildings from this time are mostly made out of glass and steel, and are usually high-rise. Examples include shopping malls (particularly the [[Iulius Mall Cluj|Iulius Mall]]), office buildings and bank headquarters. Of this last, regional headquarters of the [[Banca Română pentru Dezvoltare]] is the tallest office building in Cluj-Napoca, with {{convert|50|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/sk/st/tp/co/?id=100136|title=Tallest High-rise Buildings in Countries: Europe: Romania|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Emporis|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218051431/http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/sk/st/tp/co/?id=100136|archivedate=18 February 2007}}</ref> Its twelve storeys were completed in 1997 after 4&nbsp;years of work and house offices for the bank and for divisions of several other companies, including insurance and oil companies.

Another [[Architecture|architecturally]] interesting building is the so-called "Clădirea biscuite" (''the biscuit building''). This building was supposed to house the local headquarters of the Banca Agricolă (Agricultural Bank), but entered in the custody of the city due to the failure of that bank in the 1990s and its subsequent purchase by the [[Raiffeisen Romania|Raiffeisen Bank]], to be eventually converted in an office building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-presa_regionala_arhiva-1711762-emil-boc-inventeaza-tivul-biscuit-city-business-center-plateste-primariei-cluj-napoca-parcare-care-nu-are.htm|title=Emil Boc inventeaza "tivul la Biscuit"|publisher=Romania liberă.

The headquarters of [[Banca Transilvania]], at the intersection of [[Regele Ferdinand Avenue, Cluj-Napoca|Regele Ferdinand Avenue]] and Barițiu Street, is also a large contemporary building and was originally constructed to host the regional offices of [[Romtelecom]], the public phone company, but was later sold to the bank.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zf.ro/articol_121977/bt_spends_another_7m_euros_on_headquarters_in_cluj.html|first=Doru|last=Pop|title=BT spends another 7&nbsp;m euros on headquarters in Cluj|publisher=Ziarul Financiar|date=26 April 2007|accessdate=2008-03-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429032807/http://www.zf.ro/articol_121977/bt_spends_another_7m_euros_on_headquarters_in_cluj.html |archivedate=29 April 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Transport==
Cluj-Napoca has a complex system of regional transportation, providing road, air and rail connections to major cities in Romania and Europe. It also features a public transportation system consisting of bus, trolleybus and tram lines.

===Road===
Cluj-Napoca is an important node in the [[International E-road network|European road network]], being on three different European routes ([[European route E60|E60]], [[European route E81|E81]] and [[European route E576|E576]]). At a [[Roads in Romania|national level]], Cluj-Napoca is located on three different main national roads: [[DN1]], DN1C and DN1F.

The [[Cluj-Napoca International Airport]] (CLJ), located {{convert|9|km|mi}} to the east of the city centre, is the second busiest airport in Romania,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adevarul.ro/locale/cluj-napoca/trafic-aerian-recordinregistrat--aeroportul-international-cluj-doilea-aeroport-altarii-numarul-pasageri-primele-6-luni-1_5406af470d133766a8d0c3e3/index.html |title=Trafic aerian record înregistrat pe Aeroportul Internaţional Cluj, al doilea aeroport al ţării după numărul de pasageri din primele 6 luni |work=Adevărul |author=Florina Pop |date=3 September 2014}}</ref> after Bucharest's [[Henri Coandă International Airport|OTP]], handling over 1.4 million passengers in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anna.aero/wp-content/uploads/european-airports.xls |title=2015 pax |work=Anna Aero}}</ref> Situated on the [[European route E576]] (Cluj-Napoca–[[Dej]]), the airport is connected to the city centre by the local public transport company, CTP, bus number 8. The airport serves various direct international destinations across Europe. In 2016, a 42 m-high control tower will be inaugurated on the site of the old tower, built in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://citynews.ro/eveniment/turn-nou-de-control-la-aeroport-2016-1263001 |title=Turnul de control al aeroportului din Cluj, finalizat în 2016.

===Rail===
[[Cluj-Napoca railway station|Cluj-Napoca Rail Station]], located about {{convert|2|km|mi}} north of the city centre, is situated on the [[Căile Ferate Române|CFR-Romanian Railways]] Main Line 300 ([[Bucharest]] – [[Oradea]] – Romanian Western Border) and on Line 401 (Cluj-Napoca – [[Dej]]). CFR provides direct rail connections to all the major Romanian cities and to [[Budapest]]. The rail station is very well connected to all parts of the city by the trams, [[trolleybus]]es and buses of the local public transport company, CTP.

[[File:Cluj-Napoca, PESA 82, 2012.06.09 (2).jpg|thumb|A [[Pesa 120Na|PESA Swing]] tram on Splaiul Independenței]]
The city is also served by two other secondary rail stations, the ''Little Station'' (''Gara Micǎ''), which is technically part of and situated immediately near the main station, and ''Cluj-Napoca East'' (''Est''). There is also a cargo station, ''Halta "Clujana"''.

===Trams, trolleybusses and buses===
[[Compania de Transport Public Cluj-Napoca|CTP]], the local public transport company, runs an extensive {{convert|321|km|mi}} public transport network within the city using 3 tram lines, 6 [[trolleybus]] lines and 21 bus routes.<ref name="hall-geography" /> Transport in the Cluj-Napoca metropolitan area is also covered by a number of private bus companies, such as Fany and MV Trans 2007, providing connections to neighboring towns and villages.<ref>{{cite web|author=Vasile Racovițan|url=http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=14080|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130113132707/http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=14080|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 January 2013|title=Curse private, prețuri ca la stat|date=1 July 2008|accessdate=2009-07-03|publisher=Ziua de Cluj|language=Romanian}}</ref>

====Trams====
The local transportation company, CTP, manages a tram line that runs through the city. Planned modernisation will involve the installation of new rail tracks and the separation of the tram route from road traffic. This will bring a number of advantages, including vibration and shock reduction, a substantial noise decrease, long use expectancy and higher [[Mass transit|transit]] speed – {{convert|60|to|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftr.ro/index.php?cmd=d&id=1589|title=Tramvaiul clujean circulă expirat|date=18 January 2007|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Foaia Transilvană|language=Romanian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212002628/http://www.ftr.ro/index.php?cmd=d&id=1589|archivedate=12 February 2008}}</ref> The route will undergo major alteration on Horea Street, between the [[Chamber of Commerce]] and the central rail station, a rather problematic area. This dilemma should be solved either with the relocation of the track next to the sidewalk, or through the construction of a suspended tunnel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=5568|title=Vor tunel suspendat pe strada Horea|date=22 November 2007|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Ziua de Cluj|language=Romanian |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203124534/http://www.ziuadecj.ro/action/article?ID=5568|archivedate=3 February 2008}}</ref> Another area that will benefit from large-scale changes is "Splaiul Independenței", where the tracks will be pulled back to the [[Cluj-Napoca Central Park|Central Park]], so that the roadway can host two lanes. In the Mănăștur area, under the bridge, the tracks will be brought closer, while other major works will executed on the traffic circle on Primăverii Street. Given the development of the [[Cluj-Napoca metropolitan area|metropolitan area]], further plans feature the creation of a [[light rail]] track between [[Gilău, Cluj|Gilău]] and [[Jucu]] that will use these modernised tracks in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.clujeanul.ro/cotidian/nocache/articol/Cluj/Aviz_pentru_tramvai_nou_in_Cluj.html|title=Aviz pentru tramvai nou în Cluj|date=21 November 2007|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Clujeanul|language=Romanian|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214162106/http://old.clujeanul.ro/cotidian/nocache/articol/Cluj/Aviz_pentru_tramvai_nou_in_Cluj.html|archivedate=14 February 2008}}</ref>

==Culture and media==
Cluj-Napoca is an important centre for [[Transylvania]]n mass media, since it is the headquarters of all regional television networks, newspapers and radio stations. The largest daily newspapers published in [[Bucharest]] are usually reissued from Cluj-Napoca in a regional version, covering Transylvanian issues. Such newspapers include ''[[România Liberă]]'', ''[[Gardianul]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitateacluj.ro/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=642:GARDIANUL-REGIONAL---Cotidianul-național-Gardianul-își-lansează-ediție-regioanală_2008-04-15-03-19-55&catid=12:social&Itemid=13 |title=Cotidianul național Gardianul își lansează ediție regională |date=15 March 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-15 |publisher=Realitatea Cluj |language=Romanian |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20080503031822/http://www.realitateacluj.ro/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=642:GARDIANUL-REGIONAL---Cotidianul-na%C5%A3ional-Gardianul-%C3%AE%C5%9Fi-lanseaz%C4%83-edi%C5%A3ie-regioanal%C4%83_2008-04-15-03-19-55&catid=12:social&Itemid=13 |archivedate=3 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', ''[[ProSport]]'' and ''[[Gazeta Sporturilor]]''.

Apart from the regional editions, which are distributed throughout [[Transylvania]], the national newspaper ''[[Ziua]]'' also runs a local franchise, ''Ziua de Cluj'', that acts as a local daily, available only within city limits. Cluj-Napoca also boasts other newspapers of local interest, like ''[[Făclia]]'' and ''[[Monitorul de Cluj]]'', as well as two free dailies, ''[[Informația Cluj]]'' and ''[[Cluj Expres]]''. ''[[Clujeanul]]'', the first of a series of local weeklies edited by the media trust [[Central European Media Enterprises|CME]], is one of the largest newspapers in Transylvania, with an audience of 53,000 readers per edition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.clujeanul.ro/cotidian/nocache/articol/Cluj/CLUJEANUL_isi_schimba_infatisarea.html|title=Clujeanul își schimbă înfățișarea|date=1 December 2007|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Clujeanul|language=Romanian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20080127170826/http://old.clujeanul.ro/cotidian/nocache/articol/Cluj/CLUJEANUL_isi_schimba_infatisarea.html|archivedate=27 January 2008}}</ref> This weekly has a daily online version, entitled ''Clujeanul, ediție online'', updated on a real-time basis. Cluj-Napoca is also the centre of the Romanian [[Hungarian language]] press. The city hosts the editorial offices of the two largest newspapers of this kind, ''[[Krónika]]'' and ''[[Szabadság]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaromania.ro/|title=Media statistics for newspapers in Romania|accessdate=2008-03-13|publisher=Mediaromania.ro|language=Romanian}}</ref> as well as those of the magazines ''[[Erdélyi Napló]]'' and ''[[Korunk]]''. ''[[Săptămâna Clujeană]]'' is an economic weekly published in the city, that also issues two magazines on successful local people and companies (''Oameni de Succes'' and ''Companii de Succes'') every year, while ''[[Piața A-Z]]'' is a newspaper for announcements and advertisements distributed throughout Transylvania. Cluj had an active press in the interwar period as well: publications included the [[Zionism|Zionist]] newspaper ''[[Új Kelet]]'', the official party organs ''Keleti Újság'' (for the [[Magyar Party (Romania)|Magyar Party]]) and ''Patria'' (for the [[National Peasants' Party]]);<ref>{{cite book|last=Forter|first=Norman|author2=Rostovsky, Demeter|title=The Roumanian Handbook|publisher=Ayer Publishing|year=1971|isbn=0-405-02747-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/roumanianhandboo00norm/page/29 29]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/roumanianhandboo00norm/page/29}}</ref> and the nationalist ''Conștiința Românească'' and ''Țara Noastră'', the latter a magazine directed by [[Octavian Goga]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Blinkhorn|first=Martin|title=Fascists and Conservatives|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|isbn=0-04-940087-8|page=230}}</ref> Under Communism, publications included the socio-political and literary magazines ''Tribuna'', ''Steaua'', ''Utunk'', ''Korunk'', ''Napsugár'' and ''Előre'' as well as the regional Communist party daily organs ''Făclia'' and ''Igazság'' and the trilingual student magazine ''Echinox''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Romanian Academy|title=Dicționar enciclopedic român|volume=Volume 1|publisher=Academia Republicii Populare Române|year=1962–66|page=673}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

Among the local television stations in the city, ''[[TVR Cluj]]'' (public) and ''[[One TV (Romania)|One TV]]'' (private) broadcast regionally, while the others are restricted to the metropolitan area. ''[[Napoca Cable Network]]'' is available through cable, and broadcasts local content throughout the day. Other stations work as affiliates of national TV stations, only providing the audience with local reports in addition to the national programming. This situation is mirrored in the radio broadcasting companies: except for ''[[Radio Cluj]]'', ''[[Radio Impuls]]'' and the Hungarian-language ''[[Paprika Rádió]]'', all other stations are local affiliates of the national broadcasters. ''Casa Radio'', situated on Donath Street, is one of the modern landmarks of the media and communications industry; it is, however, not the only one: [[Palatul Telefoanelor, Cluj-Napoca|Palatul Telefoanelor]] ("the telephone palace") is also a major modernist symbol of communications in the city centre.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Magazines published in Cluj-Napoca include ''HR Journal'', a publication discussing human resources issues, ''[[J'Adore (magazine)|J'Adore]]'', a local shopping magazine that is also franchised in Bucharest, ''Maximum Rock Magazine'', dealing with the rock music industry, ''RDV'', a national hunting publication and ''Cluj-Napoca WWW'', an English-language magazine designed for tourists. Cultural and social events as well as all other entertainment sources are the leading subjects of such magazines as ''[[Șapte Seri]]'' and ''CJ24FUN''.

In the early 20th century, film production in Kolozsvár, led by [[Jenő Janovics]], was the chief alternative to Budapest.<ref name="filmkultura" /> The first film made in the city, in association with the Parisian producer [[Pathé]], was ''Sárga csikó'' ("Yellow Foal", 1912), based on a popular "peasant drama". ''Yellow Foal'' became the first worldwide Hungarian success, distributed abroad under the title ''The Secret of the Blind Man'': 137 prints were sold internationally and the movie was even screened in Japan.<ref name="filmkultura" />

The first artistically prestigious film in the annals of Hungarian cinematography was also produced on this site, based on a national classic, ''[[Bánk bán]]'' (1914), a tragedy written by [[József Katona]].<ref name="filmkultura" />

Later, the city was the production site of the 1991 Romanian drama ''Undeva în Est'' ("Somewhere in the East"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103165/|title=Undeva în Est (1991)|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> and the 1995 Hungarian language film ''[[The Outpost (1995 film)|A Részleg]]'' ("Outpost").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114313/|title=A Részleg (1995)|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> Moreover, the Romanian-language film ''Cartier'' ("Neighbourhood", 2001) and its sequel ''Înapoi în cartier'' ("Back to the Neighbourhood", 2006) both feature a story replete with violence and rude language, behind the blocks in the city's [[Mănăștur]] district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmulcartier.ro/|last=Enache|first=Cornel|title=Official website of the movie|publisher=Page Cinema|accessdate=2008-03-16|language=Romanian |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205192325/http://www.filmulcartier.ro/|archivedate=5 February 2008}}</ref> This district is also mentioned in the lyrics to the song ''Înapoi în cartier'' by [[La Familia (rap group)|La Familia]] member Puya, featured on the soundtrack of the motion picture.

Documentary and mockumentary productions set in the city include [[Irshad Ashraf]]'s ''St. Richard of Austin'', a tribute to the American film director [[Richard Linklater]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0809945/|title=St. Richard of Austin (2004) (TV)|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> and ''Cluj-Napocolonia'', a mockumentary imagining a fabulous city of the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0918505/|title=Cluj – Napocolonia (2006)|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref>

Its name commemorates two important [[Transylvania]]n figures, the Romanian physician [[Victor Babeș]] and the Hungarian mathematician [[János Bolyai]]. The university claims roots as far back as 1581, when a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college opened in Cluj, but it was in 1872 that emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] founded the University of Cluj, later renamed the ''Franz Joseph University'' (József Ferenc Tudományegyetem).<ref name="francisc-iosif">{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ubbcluj.ro/www/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=72&MMN_position=243:243|title=Învățământul universitar în Transilvania|accessdate=2008-03-12|publisher=Babeș-Bolyai University – The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science|language=Romanian}}</ref> During 1919, immediately after the end of World War I, the university was moved to [[Budapest]], where it stayed until 1921, after which it was moved to the Hungarian city of [[Szeged]].

The Romanian branch acquired the name ''Babeș''; a Hungarian university, ''Bolyai'', was established in 1945, and the two were merged in 1959. The city also hosts nine other universities, among them the [[Technical University of Cluj-Napoca|Technical University]], the [[Iuliu Hațieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy]], the [[University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Cluj-Napoca]] (USAMV), the [[Art and Design University of Cluj-Napoca|University of Arts and Design]], the [[Gheorghe Dima Music Academy]] and other private universities and educational institutes.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Footnotes==
a.{{note label|a|a|none}} The engraving, dating back to 1617, was executed by Georg Houfnagel after the painting of Egidius van der Rye (the original was done in the workshop of Braun and Hagenberg).

b.{{note label|b|b|none}} After the declaration of the union between the 1918–1920 period an exodus of Hungarian inhabitants occurred. Also, the city grew and many people moved in from the surrounding area and Cluj County as a whole, populated largely by Romanians.

c.{{note label|c|c|none}} In August 1940, as the second Vienna Award transferred the northern half of Transylvania to Hungary, many Hungarians and Romanians chose to leave or were exiled. After some ethnic Hungarians groups considered unreliable or insecure were sacked/expelled from Southern-Transylvania, the Hungarian officials also regularly expelled some Romanian groups from Northern-Transylvania.<ref>A történelem tanúi – Erdély – bevonulás 1940 p 56. - The witnesses of history – Transylvania – Entry 1940 p. 56. - {{ISBN|978-963-251-473-4}}</ref>

d.{{note label|d|d|none}} The 1941 Hungarian census is considered unreliable by most historians. In 1941, Cluj had 16,763 Jews. They were forced into ghettos in 1944 by the Hungarian authorities and deported to Auschwitz in May–June 1944.

e.{{note label|e|e|none}} In the 1960s a determined policy of industrialisation was initiated. Many people from the surrounding rural areas (largely Romanian) moved into the city, giving Cluj a Romanian majority.

f.{{note label|f|f|none}} Data refer to those for whom ethnicity is available, and do not include the 23,165 individuals (7.1% of the city's population) for whom such data are unavailable.
