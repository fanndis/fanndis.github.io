{{italic title}}'''''Gone Girl''''' is a [[thriller novel]] in the [[Mystery novel|mystery]] and [[Crime novel|crime]] genres, by the American writer [[Gillian Flynn]]. It was published by  [[Crown Publishing Group]] in June 2012. The novel became quite popular and soon made the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. The sense of suspense in the novel comes from whether or not Nick Dunne is involved in the disappearance of his wife Amy.

In several interviews, Flynn has said that she was inspired to write the novel by the disappearance of Californian [[Laci Peterson]] in late 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Real-Life Murder Mystery with 'Gone Girl' Ties|url=https://time.com/3461244/gone-girl-scott-peterson/|access-date=2020-11-21|website=Time}}</ref> Portraying her principal characters as out-of-work writers, she made use of her own experience being laid off from her job as a writer for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.

Critics in the United States positively received and reviewed the novel. Reviewers praised the novel's use of [[Unreliable narrator|unreliable narration]], [[plot twists]], and [[suspense]].

A [[Gone Girl (film)|film adaptation]] was released on October 3, 2014, directed by [[David Fincher]], and written by Flynn herself, with [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Rosamund Pike]] starring in lead roles. The film was met with both commercial success and widespread critical acclaim.

== Plot summary ==

The first part of the novel centers on Nick Dunne and Amy Elliott's marriage. Its point of view alternates between that of Nick and Amy, whose perspectives on their marriage are very different. For example, Nick describes the couple's relationship in the present day, while Amy's diary entries depict their relationship in the past. Amy's diary portrays Nick as an aggressive, moody, idle, and threatening husband, while Nick describes Amy as someone who is needlessly difficult, anti-social, stubborn, and an irrational perfectionist.

When Nick and Amy both lose their jobs in [[New York City]], they relocate to Nick's hometown in North Carthage, [[Missouri]], to help take care of Nick's sick mother. This causes their marriage to take a turn: Amy loved their life in New York, hates living in the Midwest, and soon begins to resent Nick for making her move to his hometown.

On their wedding anniversary, Amy disappears without a trace, and Nick eventually becomes a suspect in her disappearance. Among other reasons, his lack of emotion about Amy's disappearance and the discovery that Amy was pregnant when she went missing lead both the police and the public to believe that Nick may have murdered his wife.

In the second half of the book, the reader learns that the main characters are [[Unreliable narrator|unreliable narrators]] and that the reader is not being given all of the information. Nick is revealed to have been cheating on his wife, and Amy is revealed to be alive and in hiding and trying to [[Frameup|frame]] Nick for her "death" as revenge for his perceived wrongs against her. Her pregnancy and her diary entries are revealed to be fake; Amy fabricated them in order to incriminate Nick further. However, her plan is foiled when she is robbed at the motel she is hiding in. Desperate, she seeks help from her ex-boyfriend Desi Collings, who agrees to hide her in his lake house but soon becomes possessive, causing Amy to feel trapped.

Meanwhile, Nick has discovered that Amy is framing him for her murder by making purchases using credit cards in his name and hiding them in his sister Margo's woodshed, along with her anniversary gift of [[Punch and Judy]] puppets, one of which is missing a handle. However, since the clues she left for him on their anniversary treasure hunt are so vague, and based on their inside jokes that no one else would get, he has no way of proving it.

Together, he and his lawyer work to change the public's perception of Nick. He is granted an interview with a popular talk show host, during which Nick pretends to be apologetic for his infidelity and appeals to Amy to come back. It goes well with the public, but unfortunately, the police have discovered in the woodshed boxes of demeaning and violent porn videos, which Nick swears he did not buy, and Amy's diary. A few weeks later, they bring out the missing handle from the Punch and Judy puppets, soaked in Amy's blood, which has been discovered in the river, and arrest Nick.

At Desi's lake house, Amy sees the TV interview and is convinced that Nick really does want her back. She murders Desi after seducing him and returns to her husband, who is out on bond. Upon her return, she fabricates a story that she was kidnapped and imprisoned by Desi. Although Nick knows she is lying, he has no proof and is forced to return to married life with Amy as the media storm dies down.

He soon begins writing a memoir detailing Amy's crimes and deceptions. Aware of Nick's intentions to expose her lies, Amy uses Nick's [[semen]], which they saved at a fertility clinic, to make herself pregnant. She then forces him to delete his book by threatening to keep him from their unborn child. In the end, Nick deletes his memoir and chooses to stay with Amy for his child's sake.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Flynn |first=Gillian |url=https://archive.org/details/gonegirlnovel00flyn |title=Gone Girl |publisher=Crown |year=2012 |location=New York, New York |url-access=registration}}</ref>

== Characters ==
* '''Amy Elliott Dunne''': The title character. She proves to be a clever sociopath. She is the source of inspiration for her parents' "Amazing Amy" book series.  She made a living in New York as a writer for personality quizzes and met Nick at a writers' party; they marry after two years of dating, and the marriage starts out great until they both get laid off, her parents ask for financial help, and she and Nick move to North Carthage, Missouri, after no longer being able to afford living in New York City.  After that, she becomes very resentful toward Nick as he grows increasingly distant and depressed with the stress of his mother's death and father's dementia. Upon realizing that he was cheating on her, Amy spends a year developing a complex plan to frame her husband for her own murder. By utilizing her calculating intelligence and charm, she eventually returns and manages to convince the public that she was kidnapped and raped by an old boyfriend. Nick, Boney, and Go are all convinced of her guilt, but they are unable to prove it. Amy ultimately blackmails Nick into staying with her by inseminating herself with his sperm. He realizes that he now can never be free of her, and if he leaves his child would grow to hate him under Amy's manipulations. <ref name=":0" />
* '''Nick Dunne''': Raised in a working-class household with a misogynistic father who later suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]], a mother who later developed cancer, and a twin sister with whom he is close. Nick grew up as the golden child of the family and held several jobs throughout his adolescence. He worked as a journalist in New York City until he was laid off during the [[2009 recession]]. He returned to his hometown with his wife Amy, where he was weighed down by his mother's cancer and father's dementia. Amy give him money to open "The Bar" with his twin sister Go. He begins to fall out of love with Amy and has an affair with one of his students, Andie. When Amy finds out about his affair, she retaliates by concocting a plan to frame Nick for her kidnapping. Nick eventually realizes her plan and manipulated her into coming home by saying what he knew she wanted to hear during television interviews. When Amy returns, Nick tried to convince her to divorce him, but she refuses. He ultimately stays with her because she inseminates herself with his sperm and he knows he will never be free of her. He doesn't want his child to grow up hating him, or to give Amy the opportunity to falsely accuse him of abuse. <ref name=":0" />
* '''Jim Gilpin:''' A detective who participated in Nick's investigation. He is described by Nick as having "fleshy bags under his eyes" and "scraggly white whiskers in his mustache."<ref name=":0" />
* '''Rhonda Boney:''' A detective who participated in Nick's investigation. She has a younger brother whom she "dotes on," and is the mother of a teenaged daughter, Mia.<ref name=":0" /> She is described by Nick as "ugly," although he says he has an "affinity" for "ugly women."  She does not want to believe Nick is really guilty despite the seeming evidence piling on the case and gives him the benefit of the doubt until things really take a turn for the worse. When Amy returns, Nick tells Boney about Amy's confession but nobody is able to find enough evidence against her. <ref name=":0" />
* '''Tanner Bolt:''' Nick's lawyer, a defense attorney who specializes in defending husbands accused of murdering their spouses.<ref name=":0" />
* '''Andie Hardy:''' A woman in her early 20s with whom Nick cheats on Amy. Andie met Nick as a student in his magazine-writing class, and their affair began 15 months before Amy's disappearance. She appears genuinely in love with Nick and becomes very resentful when he abandons her due to Amy's disappearance. Andie goes on a talk show and tells the story of their affair at the same time that Nick confesses to his infidelity during a separate interview. <ref name=":0" />
* '''Margo ("Go") Dunne:''' Nick's twin sister, with whom he owns a bar and has a close relationship. She remains loyal to Nick throughout the murder investigation, despite her suspicions. <ref name=":0" /> 
* '''Desi Collings:''' Amy's boyfriend in high school, who is described as wealthy and obsessed with Amy. In their youth, she manipulated her parents into thinking that he was stalking her and overdosed in her bedroom. While she is on the run, Amy is robbed of all her money. She reaches out to Desi for financial help and manipulates him into falling in love with her by using his pompous savior nature against him. However, he doesn't give her money-rather, he brings her to a summer home where he essentially keeps her prisoner by not giving her any money, keys, or the gate security code. Amy quickly grows resentful of his controlling disguised as caring behavior. Her last night at Desi's house, she seduces him, puts sleeping pills in his cocktail and kills him. She later revealed that she had been abusing herself with a wine bottle and tying twine around her wrists to leave marks in order to make it look like Desi kidnapped and raped her. Desi's mother remained convinced of his innocence, but nobody is able to find evidence of Amy's guilt. <ref name=":0" />

== Composition and publication ==
Gillian Flynn is a former writer for ''Entertainment Weekly'' who wrote two popular novels prior to ''Gone Girl'' — ''[[Sharp Objects]]'' and ''[[Dark Places (novel)|Dark Places]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Nordyke |first=Kimberly |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gone-girl-author-gillian-flynn-395337 |title=Hollywood's Most Powerful Authors: Gillian Flynn on Adapting ''Gone Girl'', Being Too 'Wimpy' for Crime Reporting and Her Best Advice to Writers (Q&A) |date=30 November 2012 |work=Hollywood Reporter |access-date=5 April 2013}}</ref>  ''Gone Girl'' is her best selling book to date. Her other two books were about people incapable of making commitments, but in this novel, she tried to depict the ultimate commitment, marriage: "I liked the idea of marriage told as a he-said, she-said story, and told by two narrators who were perhaps not to be trusted." Flynn has also described marriage as "the ultimate mystery."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Haupt |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/one-true-thing/201211/best-selling-author-gillian-flynn-gone-girl |title=Best-selling Author Gillian Flynn: ''Gone Girl'' |date=19 November 2012 |work=Psychology Today |access-date=24 December 2012}}</ref>

Flynn admits to putting some of herself in the character of Nick Dunne. Like Dunne, she was a popular culture writer. Also, like Dunne, she was laid off after many years at the same job.<ref name="Memmott">{{Cite news |last=Memmott |first=Carol |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2012/10/08/gillian-flynn-interview/1610623/ |title=Gillian Flynn talks 'Gone Girl,' success and movie deals |date=9 October 2012 |work=USA Today |access-date=24 December 2012}}</ref> Flynn said, "I certainly wove that experience, that sense of having something that you were going to do for the rest of your life and seeing that possibility taken away... I definitely wove that sense of unrest and nervousness into Nick's character."<ref name="Rousseau">{{Cite news |last=Rousseau |first=Caryn |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120622/us-books-gillian-flynn/ |title=Flynn's 'Gone Girl' poised to be summer thriller |date=22 June 2012 |work=Huffington Post |access-date=26 December 2012}}</ref>

Asked how she can write so believably about a man's inner life, Flynn says, "I'm kind of part guy myself." When she needs to understand something about how men think, she asks her husband or a male friend.<ref name="Memmott" />  Flynn's autobiographical essay "I Was Not a Nice Little Girl..." invites readers to believe she took inspiration for Amy Dunne from her own interior monologue. In that essay, Flynn confesses to sadistic childhood impulses like "stunning ants and feeding them to spiders." A favourite indoor game called "Mean Aunt Rosie" allowed Flynn to cast herself as a "witchy caregiver" who exercised malevolent influence over her cousins. The same essay argues that women fail to acknowledge their own violent impulses and incorporate them into their personal narratives, though men tend to cherish stories of their childhood meanness.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/essays/flynn.html |title=I Was Not a Nice Little Girl |last=Flynn |first=Gillian |publisher=Powells.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217071048/http://www.powells.com/essays/flynn.html |archive-date=17 February 2015 |access-date=24 December 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bookreporter.com/authors/gillian-flynn/news/talk-070612 |title=Author Essay: July 6, 2012 |last=Flynn, Gillian |date=July 6, 2012 |publisher=Bookreporter.com |access-date=December 17, 2014}}</ref>

Flynn identified [[Zoë Heller]]'s ''[[Notes on a Scandal]]'' and [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' as influences on her writing and, in particular, on the plot and themes of ''Gone Girl''. Flynn said she admired the "ominous" ending of ''Notes on a Scandal'' and the pathology of a bad marriage from ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''. For the conclusion of ''Gone Girl'', Flynn drew from ''[[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|Rosemary's Baby]]'': "I love that it just ends with, you know, 'Hey, the devil's in the world, and guess what? Mom kind of likes him!'", she said.<ref name="Lee">{{Cite news |last=Lee |first=Stephan |url=http://shelf-life.ew.com/2012/12/04/gillian-flynn-gone-girl-ending/ |title=Best of 2012 (Behind the Scenes): Gillian Flynn on 'Gone Girl' twists &ndash; 'It's fine with me if people don't like the ending' |date=4 December 2012 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=24 December 2012}}</ref>

Flynn also says she is influenced by the mystery writers [[Laura Lippman]], [[Karin Slaughter]], [[George Pelecanos]], [[Dennis Lehane]], and [[Harlan Coben]]. However, she tries not to read any one genre exclusively, and she also admires [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Margaret Atwood]], [[T.C. Boyle]], and [[Arthur Phillips]], who are better known as realistic contemporary writers.<ref name="Lee" />

''Gone Girl'' is also the title of a [[Lew Archer]] story, in the 1955 collection ''The Name is Archer'', by [[Ross Macdonald]], who Flynn has also cited as a favorite author.<ref>[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/595206.The_Name_Is_Archer Goodreads listing.]</ref>

== Genre ==
''Gone Girl'' is an example of mystery, suspense, and crime genres. A ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' review, for instance, notes that the book is "more than just a crime novel". The review goes on to describe ''Gone Girl'' as a "masterful psychological thriller" which offers "an astute and thought-provoking look into two complex personalities".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Reilly |first=Amy |url=http://www.rd.com/recommends/still-worth-the-hype-gillian-flynns-gone-girl/ |title=Still Worth the Hype: Gillian Flynn's 'Gone Girl' |date=2 October 2012 |work=Reader's Digest |access-date=26 December 2012}}</ref> A ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' review notes that ''Gone Girl'' uses many of the devices common to thrillers—a cast of viable suspects, unfolding secrets, and [[red herring]]s. However, the novel does more with these devices than the thriller genre requires: "While serving their usual functions, they also do much more, launching us into an unnerving dissection of the fallout of failed dreams."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Gutman |first=Amy |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-28/features/ct-prj-0603-gone-girl-20120728_1_nick-person-investigation-printers-row |title=A marriage gone missing |date=28 July 2012 |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=26 December 2012}}</ref>

In her ''New York Times'' review, [[Janet Maslin]] also writes that the elements of ''Gone Girl'' that "sound like standard-issue crime story machinations" are not, because both narrators are also consummate liars and cannot be trusted to convey the truth about their own stories.<ref name="Maslin">{{Cite news |last=Maslin |first=Janet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/books/gone-girl-by-gillian-flynn.html |title=The Lies That Buoy, Then Break a Marriage |date=29 May 2012 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=26 December 2012}}</ref> [[Salon.com]] writes that ''Gone Girl'' has literary features that enhance the crime genre features, adding that Flynn is "kicking the genre into high gear."<ref name="Miller" /> Flynn herself says that, in writing ''Gone Girl'', she employed the mystery genre as a "thru-lane" to explore what she was really interested in: relationships.<ref name="Memmott" />

== Themes ==
''Gone Girl's'' themes include dishonesty, the devious media, the unhappiness that comes with a troubled economy, and the superficial nature of appearance. The characters lie to each other and the reader about affairs and disappearances. Amy fabricates a fake diary to implicate her husband for her disappearance and murder. Flynn says that, in writing the book, she wanted to examine how people within a marriage lie to each other: "marriage is sort of like a long con, because you put on display your very best self during courtship, yet at the same time the person you marry is supposed to love you warts and all. But your spouse never sees those warts really until you get deeper into the marriage and let yourself unwind a bit."

An underlying theme is the brief undertone of feminism, most notably represented in Amy's 'Cool Girl' speech. For some, it is in this monologue that the otherwise despised Amazing Amy emerges as an unlikely heroine of sorts; flying the flag for women who refuse to succumb to the pressure to morph into the male's ideal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wildhormoans.com/2015/02/gone-girl-3-reasons-why-im-teamamy.html |title=Gone Girl: 3 reasons why I'm #TeamAmy |publisher=wildhormoans |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212140831/http://www.wildhormoans.com/2015/02/gone-girl-3-reasons-why-im-teamamy.html |archive-date=12 February 2015 |access-date=13 February 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Flynn is a self-identified feminist and has stated that Amy's "just pragmatically evil" character and non-conformity to the traditional [["Women are wonderful" effect|perception of women as innately good]] characters are the embodiment of feminism, which she defined as "the ability to have women who are bad characters."<ref name="flynnga">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/01/gillian-flynn-bestseller-gone-girl-misogyny |title=Gillian Flynn on her bestseller Gone Girl and accusations of misogyny |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=13 February 2015}}</ref>

Several reviews have also noted how well ''Gone Girl'' shows the tricky nature of media representation. Nick seems guilty due to media coverage before a trial occurs. Salon.com notes that "Flynn, a former staff writer for ''Entertainment Weekly'', is especially good on the infiltration of the media into every aspect of the missing-person investigation, from Nick's cop-show-based awareness that the husband is always the primary suspect to a raving tabloid-TV [[The Furies|Fury]], who is out to avenge all wronged women and obviously patterned on [[Nancy Grace]]."<ref name="Miller">{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Laura |url=http://www.salon.com/2012/06/04/gone_girl_marriage_can_be_murder/ |title=Gone Girl: Marriage can be murder |date=4 June 2012 |work=Salon.com |access-date=24 December 2012}}</ref> Entertainment writer Jeff Giles notes that the novel also plays on reader expectations that the husband will be the murderer, expectations that have also been shaped by the media, writing, "The first half of ''Gone Girl'' is a nimble, caustic riff on our Nancy Grace culture and the way in which 'The butler did it' has morphed into 'The husband did it.'"<ref name="Giles">{{Cite news |last=Giles |first=Jeff |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20597896,00.html |title=Gone Girl review |date=6 June 2012 |work=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=24 December 2012}}</ref> A ''New York Daily News'' review also notes the novel's interest in how quickly a husband can be convicted in the media: "In a media society informed by Nancy Grace, when a wife goes missing, the husband murdered her. There's no need for a body to arrive at a verdict."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Connelly |first=Sherryl |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/book-review-girl-gillian-flynn-article-1.1086025 |title=Book Review: 'Gone Girl' by Gillian Flynn |date=24 December 2012 |work=Daily News |access-date=3 June 2012 |location=New York}}</ref> A ''San Francisco Chronicle'' review also notes the book's recurring commentary on media influence: "Flynn pokes smart fun at cable news, our collective obsession with social media and reality TV."<ref name="SF Chronicle">{{Cite news |last=Harwood |first=Seth |url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Gone-Girl-by-Gillian-Flynn-review-3621248.php |title='Gone Girl,' by Gillian Flynn: review |date=10 June 2012 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=26 December 2012}}</ref>

Flynn has also said that she wanted this novel to capture the sense of [[bankruptcy]] that both individuals and communities feel when the economy spirals. Not only have both her main characters lost their jobs, they have also moved to a town that is blighted by unsold houses and failed businesses. "I wanted the whole thing to feel bankrupt ...  I wanted it to really feel like a marriage that had been hollowed out in a city that had been hollowed out and a country that was increasingly hollowed out," said Flynn.<ref name="Rousseau" />

Amy's "Cool Girl" speech and the vital task of Nick's performing for his media spectators, highlight the importance of establishing and maintaining appearances, however false. Flynn said this: "The whole point is that these are two people pretending to be other people, better people, versions of the dream guy and dream girl, but each one couldn't keep it up, so they destroy each other".<ref>[[Maureen Dowd]] (12 October 2014), "[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/opinion/sunday/maureen-dowd-lady-psychopaths-welcome.html Lady psychopaths welcome]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', p.&nbsp;SR11.</ref> Amy creates her plan to frame her husband when Nick fails to maintain the false image Amy married, which she feels she is owed for keeping her side of the bargain by pretending to be his "cool girl" fantasy. She only returns to him after he gives a convincing public performance in the role of perfect husband. However, it is not his sincerity she is attracted to, she knows he is putting on an act, but the appearance of it. Amy views Nick as her ideal husband in the end because she knows he must appear to be her ideal husband, permanently, due to her blackmail and the risk of public condemnation. In exchange, she will appear as an ideal wife and mother, a trade Nick accepts. Both prefer the appearance the other projects over the reality of the person they married.

''The New York Times'' likens Gillian Flynn to acclaimed suspense novelist [[Patricia Highsmith]].

Many reviewers have noted the difficulty of writing about ''Gone Girl'', because so little in the first half of the novel is what it seems to be. In his ''Time'' review, Lev Grossman describes the novel as a "house of mirrors." He also writes "Its content may be postmodern, but it takes the form of a thoroughbred thriller about the nature of identity and the terrible secrets that can survive and thrive in even the most intimate relationships."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Grossman |first=Lev |title=My So-Called Wife |date=11 June 2012 |work=Time}} Volume 179, issue 23.

In an article in [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]], Laura Miller laments that ''Gone Girl'' was conspicuously absent from the winning ranks of prestigious literary awards, like the [[National Book Awards]], and the [[Pulitzer Prize]]. The same article argues that ''Gone Girl'' was snubbed because it belongs to the mystery genre.
