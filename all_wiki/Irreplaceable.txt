"'''Irreplaceable'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] for her second studio album, ''[[B'Day (Beyoncé album)|B'Day]]'' (2006). The song was written by [[Ne-Yo|Shaffer "Ne-Yo" Smith]], [[Stargate (music producers)|Tor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel, S. Eriksen]], [[Espionage (production team)|Espen Lind, Amund Bjørklund]], Beyoncé and produced by [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]] and Beyoncé. "Irreplaceable" was originally a [[country music|country]] record; it was re-arranged as a mid-[[tempo]] [[ballad]] with pop and R&B influences by modifying the vocal arrangements and instrumentation. During the production and recording sessions, Beyoncé and Ne-Yo wanted to create a record which people of either gender could relate to. The song's lyrics are about the breakdown of a relationship with an unfaithful man and the song contains a message about [[Women's rights|female empowerment]].

Following the moderate chart performances of "[[Déjà Vu (Beyoncé song)|Déjà Vu]]" and "[[Ring the Alarm]]", "Irreplaceable" was released internationally on October 23, 2006 as the album's second [[single (music)|single]], and the third in the United States on December 5, 2006. The single was released through [[Columbia Records]]. ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed it on their lists of Best Songs of the 2000s. "Irreplaceable" won several awards, including Best R&B/Soul Single at the 2007 [[Soul Train Music Awards]]. It was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] award at the [[50th Grammy Awards]].

The single became Beyoncé's fourth number-one in the U.S., was ''B'Day''{{'}}s most successful release, and remained at the top of the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for ten consecutive weeks. "Irreplaceable" was the twenty-fifth most successful song of the 2000s (decade) in the U.S., and was [[Music recording sales certification|certified]] double-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). It became Beyoncé's second single to achieve 200 million audience impressions in 2006. She is the second singer to achieve this feat in the U.S., the first having been [[Mariah Carey]] in 2005. "Irreplaceable" also peaked at number one in Australia, Hungary, Ireland, and New Zealand, at number four in the United Kingdom, and reached the top twenty in several other European countries. "Irreplaceable" was the most successful song of 2007 in the US and 2007's tenth best-selling digital single with over 4.6&nbsp;million copies sold worldwide.<ref name="IFPI2007YEC">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/DMR208.pdf |title=Digital Music Sales Around The World |date=January 21, 2010 |publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] |page=6 |access-date=March 17, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326004911/http://www.ifpi.org/content/library/DMR208.pdf |archive-date=March 26, 2013 }}</ref> It also was the most downloaded female ringtone of the 2000s decade in the US. 

The single's accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Anthony Mandler]] and served as the debut performance of Beyoncé's all-female band, Suga Mama. The video was included on the 2007 ''[[B'Day Anthology Video Album]]'', and a video edit was produced for "Irreemplazable", the Spanish version of the song. It won the Video of the Year award at the 2007 [[Black Entertainment Television]] (BET) Awards, and was nominated for the [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year]] at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards|2007 Awards]]. "Irreplaceable" has regularly featured in Beyoncé's tours and live performances since 2006. The [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP) recognized the song as one of the most performed of 2007 at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards.

When the team worked with Ne-Yo, they recorded the song with a male vocalist.

The recording was engineered by Jim Caruana and mixed by Jason Goldstein at [[Sony Music Studios]] in New York City.<ref name="B'Day"/> Goldstein was  hired to mix ''B'Day''. He said: "This song was really simple to mix. It was produced by Stargate and the sounds are really good and they all made sense, and there was lots of room for all the instruments."<ref name="sound"/> Goldstein used a board [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]] for the drums' treatment. For the acoustic guitars, he used the [[Analogue electronics|analogue]] [[Flanging|flanger]] of a [[TC Electronic|TC 1210]] spatial expander "to sweeten the sound" and to give them "a little bit more spread".<ref name="sound"/> Goldstein thought "Irreplaceable" sounded "a bit old-school"; an [[eighth note]] [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]] [[Echo#In music|echo]] was placed on the song's [[lead vocalist|lead vocal]] at 341ms, using the [[Line 6 (company)|''Echo Farm'']] [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] software.<ref name="sound"/> For the backing vocals, Goldstein used ''Echo Farm'' with a [[quarter note]] delay at 682ms and Sony's ''Oxford Dynamics'' [[Audio compression (data)|compressor]]/[[limiter]] in dual-mono mode.<ref name="sound"/>

The compressor was placed in Classic setting, to emulate the [[LA-2A Leveling Amplifier|LA-2A]] [[leveler|leveling amplifier]], and the Warmth button used to add harmonics. ''Oxford Dynamics'' was used for the bass in a different setting. Goldstein passed the final mix through the ''Oxford EQ'' and ''Inflator'' plug-ins.<ref name="sound"/> [[Pro Tools]] software was used to print the [[Aux-send|aux track]] into a [[44,100 Hz|44.1kHz]]/[[24-bit]] CD and then into a 24-bit [[Audio mastering|CD master]].<ref name="sound">{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr07/articles/insidetrack_0407.htm|title=Secrets Of The Mix Engineers: Jason Goldstein – Beyoncé's 'Déjà Vu' and 'Irreplaceable' |work=Sound on Sound |first=Paul |last=Tingen |date=April 2007 |access-date=September 26, 2011}}</ref> After the sessions for "Irreplaceable" ended, Hermansen said that "everyone felt they had captured something special and that Beyoncé had done the track justice", but there were still concerns that urban radio might not play the song as it featured acoustic guitars and had more of a pop appeal. "But then it became the biggest urban record ... ever," [Hermansen] said.<ref name="Gil" />

=== Songwriting controversy ===
A controversy arose over the writing credits on "Irreplaceable". Ne-Yo told MTV: "Apparently Beyoncé was at a show somewhere and right before the song came on she said, 'I wrote this for all my ladies' and then the song came on&nbsp;...&nbsp;The song is a co-write. I wrote the lyrics, I wrote all the lyrics. Beyoncé helped me with the melodies and the harmonies and the vocal arrangement and that makes it a co-write.

Jim DeRogatis of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote that "Irreplaceable" resembles ballads sung by [[Whitney Houston]].<ref>{{cite web|author=DeRogatis, Jim|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060903/ai_n16710505|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023221412/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060903/ai_n16710505|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 23, 2007|title=Spins&nbsp;– Beyonce, "B'day" (Sony)|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=September 3, 2006|access-date=January 9, 2011}}</ref> Spence D. of [[IGN]] wrote that the song was inspired by [[Aretha Franklin]]'s work since "Irreplaceable" consists of several variations in [[guttural]]s and octave range.<ref name="Spence"/> The lyrics of "Irreplaceable" concern the breakdown of a woman's relationship with her boyfriend after she discovers his infidelity, and the song "sounds a lot like a statement of independence".<ref name="Kelefa"/> Sarah Rodman of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote, "With a heretofore unknown grasp of nuance, Beyonce combines heartache, bravado, and anger as she tells a cad he's far from irreplaceable—and that, in fact, her new man will be arriving momentarily."<ref name="Boston"/> Hermansen said that "Irreplaceable" is a song that "people from all walks of life can enjoy".<ref name="Gil"/> Beyoncé said that the song is "a little honest",<ref name="Reynolds">{{cite web |last=Reynolds |first=Star Jones |title=CNN Larry King Live: Interview With Beyoncé|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0704/02/lkl.01.html |publisher=CNN|date=April 2, 2007 |access-date=January 4, 2011}}</ref> and, "... basically we can't forget our power and our worth. And sometimes you're so in love, you forget that. And sometimes you feel like you're not being appreciated. And sometimes they forget that they can be replaced."<ref name="Reynolds"/>

The song's lyrics are constructed in the verse-pre-chorus-chorus form.<ref name="Sheet"/> It begins with guitar strumming, and Beyoncé sings the [[Hook (music)|hook]]-[[Introduction (music)|intro]], "To the left, to the left: everything you own in a box to the left".<ref name="Kelefa"/><ref name="Joseph"/> In bar seven, she sings the first verse, arguing with her boyfriend about the indifference of their relationship, and tells him to walk away. The pre-chorus and chorus follow, "You must not know 'bout me&nbsp;...&nbsp;I can have another you by tomorrow / I could have another you in a minute&nbsp;...&nbsp;Don't you ever for a second get to thinking / You're irreplaceable". In the second verse, Beyoncé recollects the moment she discovered her boyfriend's infidelity. The same pattern leads to the second chorus. Towards the end, Beyoncé sings the [[bridge (music)|bridge]], where she tells her lover, "Replacing you is so easy". The song closes with an [[Ad libitum|ad-libbed]] chorus.<ref name="Kelefa"/> ''The Boston Globe'' noted that Beyoncé sings some parts of it in a higher register "that complements the lyrics' wounded sensibility".<ref name="Boston"/>

== Release ==
During the production of "Irreplaceable", Hermansen thought that the track would not receive radio play because of the acoustic guitars, and deemed the song too pop-oriented. Hermansen did not expect "Irreplaceable" to conform to any genre. Despite his prediction, the song became successful on [[urban contemporary|urban]] charts. It was played in New York and on country radio stations. Shortly after the release of "Irreplaceable", Beyoncé told MTV: "I love 'Irreplaceable'. I think it's important to have those songs. I've had so many people come up to me in tears, saying, 'I experienced my first breakup. If it wasn't for the song, I wouldn't be strong enough to not call. I wouldn't know how much I'm worth.' I'm happy to be a part of that."<ref name="Gil"/>

"Irreplaceable" was [[music video director|directed]] by [[Anthony Mandler]], who co-directed the video of "Get Me Bodied". The video features the debut performance of Beyoncé's all-female band, Suga Mama, who also appeared in the "[[Green Light (Beyoncé song)|Green Light]]" music video. Her acting-then-ex-boyfriend in the video is model [[Bobby Roache]], who played police officer for the "Ring the Alarm" music video and warrior during [[Jay-Z]] and Beyoncé's live performance at the 2006 Fashion Rocks show.<ref name="Reid">{{cite web |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |title=Beyoncé's 'Irreplaceable' Guy Had A Tough Time Getting Dumped: VMA Lens Recap |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1568975/beyonces-irreplaceable-guy-had-a-tough-time-getting-dumped-vma-lens-recap/ |publisher=MTV News|date=September 6, 2011 |access-date=January 4, 2011}}</ref> The video was included on the 2007 ''[[B'Day Anthology Video Album]]'', and a video edit was produced for "Irreemplazable".

The music video follows the storyline of the song's lyrics. "She told me to pack up all my stuff, I'm getting kicked out—the video starts off like that", said Roache.<ref name="Reid"/> It opens with Beyoncé filing her nails in silence, as her ex-partner packs up his property, as Beyoncé orders him to leave. Mid-way in the video, Beyoncé follows her then-ex-boyfriend outside the house and leans on a 2007 [[Jaguar XK]]. She appears to be pretentiously caressing him; only for the audience to find out that she is repossessing things she bought for him. He leaves her and the car, about to ride off in a taxi. Between cuts, Beyoncé manages herself in front of a mirror; putting on a lipstick, wearing huge curlers and a high-waisted skirt. There are additional beats mixed to the arrangement for the video version that can be heard, when Beyoncé sings with her all-female band, Suga Mama, towards the end. It ends with Beyoncé greeting her new boyfriend at the front door.

At the 2007 [[Black Entertainment Television|Black Entertainment Television (BET)]] Awards, Beyoncé won Video of the Year Award for "Irreplaceable", an award for which "[[Beautiful Liar]]" was also nominated.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grossberg |first=Josh |title=Beyoncé Bests BET Noms |url=http://www.eonline.com/uk/news/55175/beyonce-bests-bet-noms5 |publisher=E! |date=May 17, 2007 |access-date=January 4, 2011}}</ref> It was nominated for Video of the Year during the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]],<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kristin |first=Boehm |title=Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé Top VMA Nominations |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20050372,00.html |work=People |date=August 7, 2007 |access-date=January 4, 2011}}</ref> but it lost to Rihanna's single, "[[Umbrella (song)|Umbrella]]" (2007).<ref name="VMA2007">{{cite web |title=2007 VMA Winners |url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/2007/winners.jhtml |publisher=MTV |access-date=January 4, 2011}}</ref> At the 2007 Soul Train Music Awards, the video was nominated for the [[Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul or Rap Music Video|Michael Jackson Award for Best R&B/Soul or Rap Music Video]], but lost to rapper (and husband) Jay-Z's "[[Show Me What You Got]]" video.<ref name="Gail"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Mitchel |first=Gail |title=Beyoncé Reigns Over Soul Train Nominations |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1055285/beyonce-reigns-over-soul-train-nominations |work=Billboard |date=February 6, 2007 |access-date=January 4, 2011}}</ref> The video received two nominations for Best Female Artist and Video of the Year at the [[MTV Australia Video Music Awards 2007|2007 MTV Australia Video Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=254593 |title=2007 MTV AVMAs winners and nominees |work=MusicFix |publisher=[[ninemsn]] |access-date=July 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205190150/http://music.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=254593 |archive-date=February 5, 2012 }}</ref>
