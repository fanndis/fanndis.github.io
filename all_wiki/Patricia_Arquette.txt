==Career==

===Early career (1987–1996)===
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=They asked me to come back for 4 but at that time I was starting to break into kind of meatier roles.

In 1987, Arquette's first starring roles included pregnant teenager Stacy in the television film ''Daddy,''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fandango.com/patriciaarquette/filmography/p2423 |title=Patricia Arquette Filmography |publisher=Fandango.com |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref> boarding school student Zero in ''[[Pretty Smart]]'', and [[Kristen Parker]] in ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors]]'', alongside [[Robert Englund]] as [[Freddy Krueger]] and [[Heather Langenkamp]] as [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]]. She reprised her role as Kristen in the music video to [[Dokken]]'s ''[[Dream Warriors (song)|Dream Warriors]]'' (1987). She was asked to reprise her role in the sequel, ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]'' (1988), but she declined the offer in order to do other projects. She gave up the role of Tralala in ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn (film)|Last Exit to Brooklyn]]'' due to her pregnancy with her son Enzo.

In 1988, Arquette played the daughter of [[Tess Harper]] in ''[[Far North (1988 film)|Far North]].'' Her roles in the early 1990s were in low budget and independent films, including ''[[Prayer of the Rollerboys]]'' (1990) as love interest of [[Corey Haim]]'s character, ''[[The Indian Runner]]'' (1991), which was the directorial debut of [[Sean Penn]]; and the drama ''[[Inside Monkey Zetterland]].'' In 1992, she won a [[CableACE Award]] for Best Lead Actress in a Mini-Series for her portrayal of a deaf girl with [[epilepsy]] in ''[[Wildflower (1991 film)|Wildflower]],'' directed by [[Diane Keaton]] and also starring [[Reese Witherspoon]].

In her early career, Arquette received the most recognition for her role as Alabama Whitman, a free-spirited, kind-hearted prostitute in [[Tony Scott]]'s ''[[True Romance]]'' (1993). The film was a moderate box office success but became a cultural landmark because of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s screenplay, which preceded ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', although some critics were deterred by the graphic violence. In one scene, Arquette puts up a fierce physical struggle in a fight with [[James Gandolfini]] (as a viciously sadistic killer) which her character ultimately wins. Arquette's performance received generally unanimous praise from critics. [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' premarked that Arquette played her role with "surprising sweetness", while [[Peter Travers]] remarked that "Arquette delivers sensationally".<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/19/movies/up-and-coming-patricia-arquette-she-s-the-embodiment-of-the-spacey-flower-child.html|title=Up and Coming - Patricia Arquette - She's the Embodiment Of the Spacey Flower Child|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Aljean|last=Harmetz|date=September 19, 1993|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/true-romance-19930910|title=True Romance|first=Peter|last=Travers|date=September 10, 1993|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}</ref> ''[[TV Guide]]'' noted that the film blends and recycles elements from the story of ''[[Bonnie and Clyde]]'' and [[Terrence Malick]]'s "love on the run" film ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' (1973). It gave ''True Romance'' overall a favourable review for having "enough energy and verve to create something entirely fresh and infectiously entertaining".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/true-romance-129392/review/|title=True Romance Review|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}</ref> Richard Corliss of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' made similar statements and also likened the film to the earlier, seminal ''Bonnie and Clyde.''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979192,00.html|title=Goons Go Gun Crazy|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=September 13, 1993|accessdate=February 25, 2015|first=Richard|last=Corliss}}</ref>

Arquette next appeared in the television film ''Betrayed by Love'' (1994), and the well-received biopic ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]],'' directed by [[Tim Burton]] and starring [[Johnny Depp]], where she portrayed his girlfriend. Her next role was as Laura Bowman in [[John Boorman]]'s ''[[Beyond Rangoon]]'' (1995), which drew mixed critical reviews, but was a success internationally. In France, it was the official selection at the [[1995 Cannes Film Festival]], where it became one of the most popular hits of the event.<ref name="festival-cannes 1995">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3356/year/1995.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Beyond Rangoon |accessdate=September 2, 2009|publisher=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> Although the film had lackluster reviews, Arquette's performance as an American tourist in Burma during the [[8888 Uprising]] was regarded as one of the work's strong points. Michael Sragow, writing for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', stated "Arquette gives the kind of mighty physical performance usually delivered by men in existential action classics like "The Wages of Fear," but she suffuses it with something all her own - she's bulletproof yet vulnerable."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/beyond-rangoon|title=Beyond Rangoon|work=[[The New Yorker]]|first=Michael|last=Sragow|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}</ref> Hal Hinson of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' remarked that the film was "odd, brilliant in places, but frustrating all the same," commenting that "Arquette shows real grit when the chips are down".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/beyondrangoonrhinson_c029f1.htm|title=Beyond Rangoon|work=[[The Washington Post]]|first=Hal|last=Hinson|date=August 25, 1995|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}</ref>

Arquette appeared in three films in 1996, the first the comedy film ''[[Flirting with Disaster (film)|Flirting with Disaster]]'' (1996), about a young man's cross-country pursuit to find his parents. Critical reception was largely positive, with [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praising the film and the authenticity of Arquette's performance, highlighting that "Arquette [is] very believably distracted and infuriated".<ref>{{cite news|first=Todd|last=McCarthy|url=https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/flirting-with-disaster-3-1200445284/|title=Flirting with Disaster|work=Variety|date=March 18, 1996|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}</ref> ''Flirting with Disaster'' grossed $14 million at the American box office and was screened in the ''[[Un Certain Regard]]'' section at the [[1996 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="Festival-Cannes 1996">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4704/year/1996.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Flirting with Disaster |accessdate=September 20, 2009 |publisher=Festival-Cannes.com}}</ref> Her second film released that year was the period drama ''[[The Secret Agent (1996 film)|The Secret Agent]],'' an adaptation of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1907 novel of the same name.

===Independent film work and critical success (1997–2003)===
In 1997, Arquette starred in [[David Lynch]]'s neo-noir psychological thriller ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]],'' in dual roles as Renee Madison and Alice Wakefield. The film had an ambiguous narrative, which polarized audiences and drew varying critical opinion, but it established a strong cult following. Arquette played an elusive [[femme fatale]] in a critically revered performance that enabled her to draw on her sexuality more than any other previous role. [[Roger Ebert]], of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', disliked the film, saying there was "no sense to be made of it" and voiced his distaste over a scene in which Arquette's character is asked to disrobe at gunpoint.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lost-highway-1997|first=Roger|last=Ebert|title=Lost Highway|date=February 27, 1997|publisher=rogerebert.com|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}</ref> Other critics were more favourable: Andy Klein of the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' called it a "two-hour plus fever dream",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/1997-02-27/film/a-bumpy-ride/|title=A bumpy ride|work=Dallas Observer|first=Andy|last=Klein|date=February 27, 1997}}</ref> Michael Sragow of ''The New Yorker'' called the film a "compelling erotic nightmare",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/online/filmfile/pop/?88DCD25E7E9E367D00666425 |first=Michael |last=Sragow |title=Lost Highway |accessdate=February 25, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107231933/http://www.newyorker.com/online/filmfile/pop/?88DCD25E7E9E367D00666425 |archivedate=January 7, 2006}}</ref> and Edward Guthman of the ''[[San Francisco Gate]]'' wrote a glowing review praising Arquette's performance, calling it the "strongest, most memorable performance [of the film]" and favourably comparing her double role to [[Kim Novak]]'s in ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Highway-Travels-A-Weird-Route-David-Lynch-2852820.php|title=Lost Highway travels a weird route|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|first=Edward|last=Guthman|date=February 28, 1997}}</ref> That same year, Arquette appeared in ''[[Nightwatch (1997 film)|Nightwatch]]'', a horror-thriller film directed by [[Ole Bornedal]]. The film is a remake the [[Denmark|Danish]] film ''[[Nattevagten]]'' (1994), which was also directed by Bornedal. ''Nightwatch'' was not a box office success and received poor reviews by critics, many of whom considered it an unnecessary, inferior retelling of the original film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/NIGHT.php |title=Nightwatch - Box Office Data |accessdate=July 25, 2011 |publisher=The Numbers}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1082428-nightwatch/|title=Nightwatch|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=February 25, 2015}}</ref>

1998 saw Arquette perform in two films: ''[[Goodbye Lover]]'', a comedic neo-noir directed by [[Roland Joffé]] and ''[[The Hi-Lo Country]]'', a period Western directed by [[Stephen Frears]]. The former received a poor critical reception while the latter received a more appreciative albeit modest response.

''Fast Food Nation'' received mixed to positive critical reviews. [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' awarded the film three out of four stars and added, "It's less an exposé of junk-food culture than a human drama, sprinkled with sly, provoking wit, about how that culture defines how we live ...
