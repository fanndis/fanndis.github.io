The wedding dress of Princess Elizabeth (the future [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]) was worn at her [[Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten|wedding to Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh]] on 20 November 1947 in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Given the rationing of clothing at the time, she still had to purchase the material using [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|ration coupons]].<ref name="Gibson2001">{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Clare|title=The Wedding Dress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s9f_nSD4geQC|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=15 October 2001|publisher=Courage Books|isbn=978-0-7624-1119-1}}</ref> The dress was designed by [[Norman Hartnell]].<ref name="Steele2010">{{cite book|last=Steele|first=Valerie|title=The Berg Companion to Fashion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hemsvn9ZbRkC&pg=PA392|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=9 November 2010|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-84788-592-0|page=392}}</ref> Hartnell's signature was said to be embroidery, and he enjoyed "working with soft, floating fabrics, particularly tulle and chiffon, and with plain, lustrous silks".<ref name="Steele2010"/> The dress was made of Chinese silk, with a high neckline, tailored bodice and a short train.

The dress, without straps and with long sleeves, provided a "fit and flare silhouette".<ref name="Delamore2005">{{cite book|author=Philip Delamore|title=The Perfect Wedding Dress|url=https://archive.org/details/perfectweddingdr0000dela|url-access=registration|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=8 December 2005|publisher=Firefly Books|isbn=978-1-55407-130-2}}</ref>

== Design ==
The wedding was a royal event held following the end of the Second World War. The dress, designed by the Court Designer [[Norman Hartnell]], had a star-patterned fan-shaped bridal train that was {{convert|13|ft|m}} in length. The train, symbolic of rebirth and growth after the war, was stated to be inspired by [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s c. 1482 painting of [[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]], particularly the elaborate embroidery motifs of scattered flowers on the rich satin dress and the tulle veil worn by the royal bride.<ref name=Vogue>{{Cite web|last=Bowles|first=Hamish|url=http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/hamishsphere-a-vogue-history-of-royal-wedding-dresses/
|title=Hamishsphere: A ''Vogue'' History of Royal Wedding Dresses|accessdate=30 April 2011|publisher=Vogue Daily|date=25 April 2011}}</ref> The material used was ivory silk and a [[Elizabeth II's jewels#Queen Mary Fringe Tiara|diamond fringe tiara]] secured her [[veil]]. The dress was decorated with [[crystals]] and 10,000 seed [[pearls]], imported from the United States of America. Hartnell, who had been Court Designer since 1938, claimed it as "the most beautiful dress I had so far made".<ref name=Royal>{{Cite web|url=http://www.awegirls.com|title=A Royal Wedding: 20 November 1947|accessdate=30 April 2011|publisher=The Royal Collection}}</ref>

On account of the austerity measures following the war, Princess Elizabeth had to use clothing ration coupons to show her entitlement to the dress.<ref name=Vogue/> The government allowed her 200 extra ration coupons. She was given hundreds of clothing coupons by brides-to-be from all parts of the country to help her acquire the dress. She had to return these coupons as it was illegal for them to have been given away in the first instance.<ref>{{cite web|title=60 amazing facts you never knew about the Queen|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/60-amazing-queen-facts-you-661023|accessdate=3 February 2015}}</ref> 

The designs for the dress were approved three months before the wedding. Hartnell's search for suitable designs in London art galleries had led to him to the Botticelli figure. This was the inspiration for the use of ivory silk with flower designs of [[jasmine]], [[smilax]], [[syringa|lilac]] and [[white rose]]-like blossoms added to the train, embellished by white crystals and pearls. These motifs were transferred to drawings to enable embroidery experts to work on them. The dress featured a "heart-shaped neckline and long tight sleeves".<ref name="RoyalDress">{{cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/wedding-dresses|title=Royal Wedding Dresses throughout history|publisher=The Royal Family|accessdate=9 October 2018}}</ref> The silk cloth was chosen at the specific directive of her mother, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|the Queen]], who desired an "unusually rich, lustrous stiff satin which was made at [[Lullingstone Castle]]".<ref name="60-BBC">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7100546.stm|title=Sixty facts about a royal marriage|publisher=BBC|date=18 November 2007|accessdate=15 November 2018}}</ref> The silkworms to manufacture the silk were bought from [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Nationalist China]] and not from [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922–1943)|Italy]], which were the UK's enemies during the war. [[Satin]] was chosen for the train, and a more flexible material of the same tone as the train was chosen for the dress. However, in spite of the careful choice of the silk, the curator of the London Museum observed 30 years later when the dress was on display at the museum that "the choice of silk was not a good one" as the fabric had deteriorated. It was also noted that the "weight of the embroidery dragged the skirt down, increasing the strain on the weave."<ref name=fashion>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fashion-era.com/the_queens_robes.htm|title= The Queen's Wedding Dress|accessdate=30 April 2011|publisher=Fashionera.com}}</ref> Round the hem of the dress, "a border of [[orange blossom]] was appliqued with transparent tulle outlined in seed pearls and crystal".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/royal-wedding-traditions|title=Royal Wedding Traditions|publisher=The Royal Family|accessdate=9 October 2018}}</ref>

The final design of the dress was kept secret, although much speculation surrounded it. It was said the princess feared that if details were published fashion house copies would make it impossible for her to make last-minute design alterations.<ref name="Melbourne Age">{{cite news|last1=AAP|title=Simple wedding gown for princess|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&dat=19471104&id=o8VVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=I8QDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3246,3021485|accessdate=22 August 2014|publisher=The Age, Melbourne|date=4 November 1947}}</ref> The dress was taken to the palace a day before the wedding in a {{convert|adj=on|4|ft}} box. On the wedding day, the dress glittered, bejewelled with pearls "skilfully combined with flowing lines of wheat ears, the symbol of fertility, and worked in pearl and diamante."<ref name=fashion/>

==Similarities==
Princess Elizabeth's wedding dress has drawn parallels with both the similarly designed dress worn by [[Grace Kelly]] in 1956 and the "Westminster décor" wedding dress that [[Sarah Burton]] at [[Alexander McQueen]] designed for [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Catherine Middleton]]; particular points of similarity have been highlighted in the pleats and silhouette of the skirt.<ref name=Three>{{Cite news|last=Boyle|first=Katherine|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/arts-post/post/three-princesses-one-style-referencing-queen-elizabeth-ii-and-grace-kelly-in-middletons-dress/2011/04/29/AFM5xnDF_blog.html|title=Three Princesses, One Style: Referencing Queen Elizabeth II and Grace Kelly in Middleton’s Dress|accessdate=30 April 2011|newspaper= Washington Post|date=29 April 2011}}</ref>

The dress was put on display at St James's Palace and was then exhibited in the major cities and towns of the UK.<ref name="60-BBC"/>
