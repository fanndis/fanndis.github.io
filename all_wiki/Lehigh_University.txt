==Spirit and traditions==
Lehigh students have several lasting traditions: Lehigh's school colors, brown and white, date back to 1874, and the school newspaper of the same name was first published in 1894.

Following the death of Asa Packer in May 1879, the University established "Founder's Day" to be held in October to remember and recognize those have contributed to the success of the University. The event remains an annual tradition.

Freshmen are traditionally inducted into the University in a convocation in the [[Zoellner Arts Center]] and welcomed at a Freshman-Alumni Rally where their class flag is given to them by the class from fifty years before.

Until the 1970s, freshmen wore small brown hats with their class numbers called "dinks" from the beginning of the fall semester until the Lafayette football game. The week leading up to the big game was full of festivities created to unite the students and fuel spirit. In one of these events, "The Pajama Parade," the freshmen were led across the penny toll bridge in their pajamas singing "We Pay No Tolls Tonight" to the [[Moravian College]] dormitories where they would serenade the women. The week before the game still involves decoration of the Greek houses, a bonfire, parties, rallies and the [[Marching 97]] performing unexpectedly during classes the Friday before the game.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Lehigh: Marching 97 Campus Tour |url=https://www1.lehigh.edu/about-hallmarks-traditions-marching-97-campus-tour |publisher=Lehigh University |quote=The march is called "Eco-flame" because in the '70s Professor Rich Aaronson asked the band to play for his ECO 001 class. |access-date=August 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819170016/https://www1.lehigh.edu/about-hallmarks-traditions-marching-97-campus-tour |archive-date=August 19, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== The Clery Act ==
{{Main|Clery Act|Jeanne Clery}}
On April 5, 1986, a 19-year-old Lehigh freshman was raped and murdered in her dorm room; the perpetrator was apprehended, tried and sentenced to death. The backlash against unreported crimes on numerous campuses across the country led to the [[Murder of Jeanne Clery|Jeanne Clery]] Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The Clery Act requires that colleges reveal information regarding crime on their campuses.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116872,00.html|title=After Their Daughter Is Murdered at College, Her Grieving Parents Mount a Crusade for Campus Safety|last=Gross|first=Ken|date=February 19, 1990|magazine=People.com|accessdate=2011-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604122642/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20116872,00.html|archive-date=June 4, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.securityoncampus.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=271&Itemid=60|title=Complying With The Jeanne Clery Act|publisher=Securityoncampus.org|accessdate=2011-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213104921/http://www.securityoncampus.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=271&Itemid=60|archive-date=December 13, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

20 years after the federal Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act took effect, thought leaders on campus safety came to Lehigh to discuss critical safety issues for colleges and universities. The event, "Proceeding in Partnership: The Future of Campus Safety," was held on the Lehigh campus in September 2011, and was co-sponsored by Security on Campus (SOC), which was founded by Connie and Howard Clery following the death of their daughter, Jeanne Clery. The conference represented the first cooperative effort between Lehigh and the organization since Jeanne Clery's death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www4.lehigh.edu/news/newsarticle.aspx?Channel=/Channels/News:+2011&WorkflowItemID=b681a630-0fc5-42e9-acb5-153d3de0927c|title=National campus safety issues are focus of summit|year=2011|accessdate=2012-09-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603221627/http://www4.lehigh.edu/news/newsarticle.aspx?Channel=%2FChannels%2FNews%3A+2011&WorkflowItemID=b681a630-0fc5-42e9-acb5-153d3de0927c|archive-date=June 3, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>
