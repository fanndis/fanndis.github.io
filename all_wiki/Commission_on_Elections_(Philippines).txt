{{Politics of Philippines}}
The '''Commission on Elections''' ({{lang-fil|Komisyon sa Halalan}}), usually abbreviated as '''{{Sc1|COMELEC}}''',<ref>[http://www.comelec.gov.ph/ home page of the {{Sc2|COMELEC}} website] accessed January 28, 2016 consistently uses the all upper case abbreviation of "COMELEC" rather than "Comelec"</ref> is one of the three [[constitutional commissions]] of the [[Philippines]]. Its principal role is to enforce all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of [[elections in the Philippines]].

==Functions==
According to Article IX-C, Section 2 of the [[1987 Constitution of the Philippines]], the Commission on Elections shall exercise the following powers and functions:<ref>Article IX-C, Section 2, 1987 Constitution of the Philippines</ref>
# Enforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election, plebiscite, initiative, referendum, and recall.
# Exercise exclusive original jurisdiction over all contests relating to the [[Election|elections]], returns, and qualifications of all elective regional, provincial, and city officials, and appellate jurisdiction over all contests involving elective municipal officials decided by trial courts of general jurisdiction, or involving elective barangay officials decided by trial courts of limited jurisdiction. Decisions, final orders, or rulings of the Commission on election contests involving elective municipal and barangay offices shall be final, executory, and not appealable.
# Decide, except those involving the right to vote, all questions affecting elections, including determination of the number and location of polling places, appointment of election officials and inspectors, and registration of voters.
# Deputize, with the concurrence of the President, law enforcement agencies and instrumentalities of the Government, including the Armed Forces of the Philippines, for the exclusive purpose of ensuring free, orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections.
# Register, after sufficient publication, political parties, organizations, or coalitions which, in addition to other requirements, must present their platform or program of government; and accredit citizens’ arms of the Commission on Elections. Religious denominations and sects shall not be registered. Those which seek to achieve their goals through violence or unlawful means, or refuse to uphold and adhere to this Constitution, or which are supported by any foreign government shall likewise be refused registration. Financial contributions from foreign governments and their agencies to political parties, organizations, coalitions, or candidates related to elections constitute interference in national affairs, and, when accepted, shall be an additional ground for the cancellation of their registration with the Commission, in addition to other penalties that may be prescribed by law.
# File, upon a verified complaint, or on its own initiative, petitions in court for inclusion or exclusion of voters; investigate and, where appropriate, prosecute cases of violations of election laws, including acts or omissions constituting election frauds, offenses, and malpractices.
# Recommend to the Congress effective measures to minimize election spending, including limitation of places where propaganda materials shall be posted, and to prevent and penalize all forms of election frauds, offenses, malpractices, and nuisance candidacies.
# Recommend to the President the removal of any officer or employee it has deputized, or the imposition of any other disciplinary action, for violation or disregard of, or disobedience to its directive, order, or decision.
# Submit to the President and the Congress a comprehensive report on the conduct of each election, plebiscite, initiative, referendum, or recall.

===Predecessor===
====The Executive Bureau====
The Commission on Elections ({{Sc1|COMELEC}}) was created by a 1940 amendment to the 1935 [[Constitution of the Philippines]]. Before the creation of the {{Sc1|COMELEC}}, supervision over the conduct of elections was vested by law in the Executive Bureau under the Department of Interior and, later directly by the same Department. The Secretary of Interior saw to it that local authorities performed the ministerial duties assigned to them by the Election Code. He decides administrative questions concerning elections. The courts, however, exercised exclusive and final jurisdiction over questions affecting the right to vote as well as contested elections of local elective officials. Elections contests involving members of the [[National Assembly of the Philippines|National Assembly]] were judged solely by an Electoral Commission composed of three justices of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] and six members of the National Assembly.

===Statutory commission===
In view, however, of the close official ties between the [[President of the Philippines|President]] and the Secretary of Interior, there was always the danger of a partisan Secretary of the Interior exploiting his powers and influence to ensure the victory of his party at the polls. As a consequence, the Constitution was amended in 1940 to create an independent Commission on Elections, composed of a Chairman and two other members, to take over the functions of the Secretary of the Interior relative to the elections. but since the amendments could not be effective in time for the 1940 elections, the National Assembly, by Commonwealth Act No. 607, created a Commission on Elections, giving thereto the same powers which the Commission on Elections could have under the amended Constitution. The statutory Commission supervised the conduct of the December 10, 1940 local elections.

===Creation===
The constitutional amendment creating the Commission on Elections was finally approved on December 2, 1940. On June 21, 1941, Commonwealth Act No. 657 was enacted reorganizing the Commission on Elections as a constitutional entity. The members of the statutory Commission continued as members of the constitutional Commission.

The Chairman and Members of the Commission had a fixed term of nine years each – a member being replaced every three years except in the first Commission. They could be removed from office only by [[impeachment]]. They were provided with fixed salaries which could neither be increased nor diminished during their term of office. These were safeguards to ensure the independence of the Commission.

The administrative control of elections exercised by the Secretary of Interior was transferred to the Commission on Elections. The Commission was vested with the exclusive charge of enforcing and administering all laws relative to elections and power to decide all questions affecting elections, except those involving the right to vote, which were left to final judicial determination. The courts and electoral tribunals retained their original powers over election contests.

===Membership expansion===
The 1973 Constitution enlarged the membership of the Commission from three to nine members but reduced their term of office from nine years to seven years. As in the 1935 Constitution, the Chairman and Commissioners have staggered terms of office and could be removed from office only by impeachment.

First to serve in the Commission on Elections under the 1973 Constitution were former Senator Leonardo B. Perez, as Chairman, and Venacio S. Duque, Flores A. Bayot, Jose M. Mendoza, Fernando R. Veloso, Lininding Pangandaman, Venancio L. Yaneza and Casimiro R. Madarang, Jr. as Commissioners. Commissioner Pangandaman, the first Muslim Commissioner of the {{Sc1|COMELEC}}, was appointed Ambassador by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] even before the expiration of his term. His unexpired term was taken over by Commissioner Hashim R. Abubakar.

On May 17, 1980, Chairman Perez (who was later appointed Minister on Political Affairs by President Marcos) and Commissioners Duque and Bayot, after completing their seven-years term, retired. Commissioner Santiago succeeded Perez, and the following were appointed Commissioners: Domingo C. Pabalete; Victorino A. Savellano; Jaime C. Opinion; Noli Sagadraca; Romeo Firme: Luis Lardizabal and Ide C. Tillah. With Commissioner Lardizabal the membership of the Commission was thus increased to eight, one short of the full complement of nine.

Upon the retirement of Commissioners Firme, Tillah and Lardizabal on May 17, 1983 the Commission on Elections was composed of only five members. On March 21, 1983, two new members were appointed by President Marcos, namely: Froilan Bacungan and Ramon H. Felipe, Jr. With the retirement of Chairman Santiago and Commissioners Pabalete and Sagadraca on May 17, 1984, Savellano was appointed Chairman. Three new members were appointed on July 27, 1985, namely: Commissioners Quirino A. Marquinez, Mangontawar Guro and Mario D. Ortiz. On January 31, 1986 Commissioners Ruben C. Agpalo and Jaime Layosa were appointed to finally complete the required membership of nine.

===After the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution===
After the tumultuous February 7, 1986 [[1986 Philippine presidential election|snap elections]] and the [[People Power Revolution]], Chairman Savellano and all the Commissioners of the {{Sc1|COMELEC}} tendered their courtesy resignations which, except those of Commissioners Bacungan and Felipe, were accepted by President [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon C. Aquino]].

On April 11, 1986 Commissioner Felipe was appointed Acting Chairman. On July 23, 1986 he took his oath of office as permanent Chairman, together with Commissioners Leopoldo Africa, [[Haydee Yorac]], Andres Flores, Anacleto Badoy, and Dario Rama as members of the "new" Commission on Elections. On February 15, 1988 [[Hilario G. Davide, Jr.]], was appointed Chairman with Alfredo E. Abueg, Jr., Haydee B. Yorac, Leopoldo L. Africa, Andres R. Flores, Dario C. Rama and Magdara B. Dimaampao as Commissioners. Commissioner Haydee B. Yorac was appointed as Acting Chairman when Hilario G. Davide, Jr. was appointed Chairman of the Presidential Fact Finding Commission in December 1989, pursuant to Administrative Order No. 146. On June 6, 1991 [[Christian Monsod]] was appointed by President Aquino as Chairman of the Commission to serve the unexpired term of Davide.

When Monsod retired on February 15, 1995 President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] appointed Court of Appeals Justice [[Bernardo P. Pardo|Bernardo Pardo]] as Chairman of the Commission. Pardo's term was cut short when he was appointed by President [[Joseph Estrada]] as Associate Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] in October 1998. Commissioner [[Luzviminda Tancangco]] was appointed Acting Chairman of the Commission.

On January 11, 1999 President Estrada appointed [[Sandiganbayan]] Justice [[Harriet Demetriou]] as Chairman of the Commission. After the events of January 17 to 20, 2001 that led to the ouster and resignation of President Estrada from power, Demetriou tendered her courtesy resignation which was accepted by President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]].

On February 19, 2001 President Arroyo appointed Justice [[Alfredo Benipayo]] as Chairman of the Commission. However, the Commission on Appointments did not confirm his appointment due to opposition of some Commissioners led by Luzviminda Tancangco. On June 5, 2002 President Arroyo appointed [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] Chairman and former [[Mandaluyong City]] mayor [[Benjamin Abalos|Benjamin S. Abalos, Sr.]] to replace Benipayo. On January 26, 2008, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] appointed former Supreme Court Associate Justice Jose Melo, 77, to replace Chair Abalos.<ref>Marichu Villanueva [http://asianjournalusa.com/melo-named-new-comelec-chairman-p3958-67.htm Melo named new {{Sc1|COMELEC}} chairman] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428184916/http://asianjournalusa.com/melo-named-new-comelec-chairman-p3958-67.htm |date=April 28, 2012 }}. asianjournalusa.com (January 26, 2008)</ref> The United Opposition ([[Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino]]) opposed Melo's appointment.<ref>[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/video/17270/opposition-questions-melo-s-appointment-as-poll-chief Opposition questions Melo's appointment as poll chief]. gmanetwork.com.

==Issues and incidents==
===ZTE broadband contract controversy===
In August 2007, Nueva Vizcaya Rep. Carlos Padilla delivered a privilege speech alleging that Abalos brokered for the national broadband network (NBN) project. Padilla claimed that Abalos met with officials of the Chinese firm ZTE Corp., which got the US $329 million contract for the broadband project.

Abalos denied brokering for the National Broadband Network project despite admitting he knows some officials in ZTE Corp. He admitted making four trips to China and playing golf there. He also admitted that ZTE officials, whom he says are his golf buddies, hosted and paid for the trips.

Jose de Venecia III, son of House Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr, alleged that Abalos offered him US$10 million to withdraw his proposal on the NBN project. De Venecia is a majority shareholder of Amsterdam Holdings Inc., a company that submitted an unsolicited proposal on the NBN project. De Venecia also claimed that Abalos asked for money from the ZTE Corp. officials.

===Hello Garci scandal===
{{main|Hello Garci scandal}}
Abalos was mentioned in the "Hello Garci" tape, which refers to the alleged wiretapped conversations where vote rigging in the 2004 elections was discussed by, among others, a woman presumed to be President Arroyo and man presumed to be {{Sc1|COMELEC}} Commissioner [[Virgilio Garcillano]].

===Mega Pacific===
Abalos was the {{Sc1|COMELEC}} chair when the election body approved a P1.3-billion contract with the Mega Pacific Consortium for the purchase of automated counting machines, which the Supreme Court in January 2004 declared as void because of "clear violation of law and jurisprudence" and "reckless disregard of {{Sc1|COMELEC}}'s own bidding rules and procedure."

On January 21, 2004, Pimentel filed criminal and administrative charges before the Ombudsman against Abalos and other commissioners in connection with the deal. Abalos described the charges as a "demolition job."

Pimentel accused Abalos and the other commissioners of committing an act of impropriety when they and their wives traveled to Seoul, South Korea to visit the plant of the maker of the counting machines a few months before the bidding for the contract started. Pimentel said he received information that the Korean company paid for the plane tickets and hotel accommodations for the trip.

However, Abalos claimed that the expenses for the trip were paid for out of the P1 million he won in a golf tournament in Wack Wack.

On September 27, 2006, the Ombudsman, in a resolution, absolved all respondents involved in the Mega Pacific controversy of all administrative and criminal liabilities "for lack of probable cause." It also reversed its June 28 resolution which contained factual findings that can be used by the House of Representatives to initiate impeachment proceedings against {{Sc1|COMELEC}} Commissioner Resureccion Borra.

===Website hacking===
