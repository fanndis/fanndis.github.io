==Parliamentary career==

Baker prided himself on "uncovering scandals and conflicts of interest among MPs and the government".

===Front-bench career===
In the 2001–05 Parliament, Baker was a member of the [[Joint Committee on Human Rights]], and was appointed as Liberal Democrat [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Environment spokesman]] in 2002, a post he held until his resignation in 2006 following the election of Sir [[Menzies Campbell]] as party leader.

As Environment spokesman in May 2005, he joined with two former environment ministers, the Labour MP [[Michael Meacher]] and the Conservative [[John Gummer]], to table a cross-party [[Early Day Motion]] No. 178<ref name="EDM178">{{cite web |url=http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=28373 |title=Early Day Motion 178: Climate Change |accessdate=24 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113141314/http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=28373 |archive-date=13 January 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in support of a [[Climate Change]] Bill drafted by [[Friends of the Earth (EWNI)|Friends of the Earth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/pabills/200506/climate_change.htm |title=Climate Change Bill, 2005 |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |date=13 July 2005 |accessdate=24 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115012923/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/pabills/200506/climate_change.htm |archive-date=15 November 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foe.co.uk/campaigns/climate/news/gov_climate_bill.html |title=Friends of the Earth secures Climate Change Bill |work=[[Friends of the Earth (EWNI)|Friends of the Earth]] website |accessdate=24 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007233023/http://www.foe.co.uk/campaigns/climate/news/gov_climate_bill.html |archive-date=7 October 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> The motion called for a Bill to be "brought forward in this Parliament so that annual cuts in carbon dioxide emissions of 3 per cent can be delivered in a framework that includes regular reporting and new scrutiny and corrective processes" and attracted 412 signatures.<ref name="EDM178" /> Baker also opposed nuclear power, describing it as "hopelessly uneconomic", and warning that new nuclear power stations "would generate vast quantities of nuclear waste and divert essential funding away from energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4620072.stm |title=Nuclear energy 'too uneconomic' |work=BBC News |date=17 January 2006 |accessdate=24 November 2007 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325143143/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4620072.stm |archive-date=25 March 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===David Kelly===
Baker announced on 19 May 2006 that his decision to step down from the Liberal Democrat front bench had been based on a decision to pursue a quest to establish the truth behind the death in 2003 of [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]],<ref name="BBC-Kelly-investigation">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4995076.stm |title=MP investigates Dr Kelly's death |author=Brian Wheeler |work=BBC News |date=19 May 2006 |accessdate=24 November 2007 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808011132/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4995076.stm |archive-date=8 August 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> an expert in biological warfare employed by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and a former United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq. Kelly's discussion with BBC ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme journalist [[Andrew Gilligan]] about the British government's dossier on [[weapons of mass destruction|weapon of mass destruction]] (WMD) in Iraq inadvertently caused a major political scandal. Kelly had been found dead days after appearing before the Parliamentary committee investigating the scandal.

The [[Hutton Inquiry]], a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death, ruled that he had committed suicide and that Kelly had not in fact said some of the things attributed to him by Gilligan. Baker said that Hutton had "blatantly failed to get to the bottom of matters", and that "the more I look into it the less convinced I am by the explanation and the more unanswered questions appear which ought to have been addressed properly by the Hutton inquiry or by the coroner."<ref name="BBC-Kelly-investigation" />

In July that year, Baker claimed that data had been wiped from the hard drive on one of his computers. Although some news reports suggested that this related to evidence showing Kelly's death was not a suicide,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/5178302.stm |title=Files 'wiped' in Dr Kelly inquiry |work=BBC News |date=13 July 2006 |accessdate=24 November 2007 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=1024802006 |title=MP says files into Kelly death have been wiped |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=14 July 2006 |accessdate=24 November 2007 |location=Edinburgh |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516082150/http://news.scotsman.com/politics.cfm?id=1024802006 |archive-date=16 May 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Baker maintained that none of his research on Kelly had been stored on that particular machine.<ref>''The Strange Death of David Kelly'' Norman Baker</ref> In April 2007 he announced his findings, telling a meeting in Lewes:<blockquote>I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that this could not be suicide. The medical evidence does not support it and David Kelly's state of mind and personality suggests otherwise. It was not an accident so I am left with the conclusion that it is murder."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/display.var.1327811.0.0.php |title=Murder theory that just won't go away |author=Miles Godfrey And Katya Mira |work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]] |date=13 April 2007 |accessdate=24 November 2007 |quote=The greatest British conspiracy theory of the modern age was unveiled this week.

His book, ''The Strange Death of David Kelly'', was published in October 2007, and serialised in the ''[[Daily Mail]]''. Some relatives of Kelly have expressed their displeasure at the publication. The husband of Kelly's sister Sarah said "It is just raking over old bones ...

In February 2008 he released a statement to mark [[International Mother Language Day]] saying "The [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] government are following a deliberate policy of extinguishing all that is Tibetan, including their own language in their own country.

On 18 March 2008 he addressed Tibetan protesters outside the Chinese embassy in London, and also delivered a letter to Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] from six Tibetan students in the UK who were supporting Tibetans in the [[2008 Tibetan unrest]]. The students' letter called for an end to the unrest's suppression, a [[UN]] investigation into it, and for unfettered media access in Tibet.<ref name="BBC-20080321" />

In March 2010, the BBC ran an investigation detailing 37 occasions that Baker failed to declare a financial interest in Tibet during parliamentary debates and questions, despite receiving hospitality from the Tibetan government-in-exile. Baker released a statement saying that it was an oversight.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8574332.stm |work=BBC News |title=Norman Baker MP: Foreign trips and rule breaches |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref>

In 2013, Baker was quoted as saying that rail fares were "not that expensive" when compared to fares for rail travel in other countries, and that deals that were available reduced the price significantly.
