The '''Democratic National Committee''' ('''DNC''') is the governing body of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|United States Democratic Party]]. The committee coordinates strategy to support Democratic Party candidates throughout the country for local, state, and national office. It organizes the [[Democratic National Convention]] held every four years to nominate a candidate for [[President of the United States]] and to formulate the [[party platform]]. While it provides support for party candidates, it does not have direct authority over elected officials.<ref name="DNC organization">{{cite web|url=https://www.democrats.org/organization/the-democratic-national-committee|title=Democrats.org|publisher=DNC|access-date=January 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617155424/https://www.democrats.org/organization/the-democratic-national-committee|archive-date=June 17, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Its chair is elected by the committee. It conducts fundraising to support its activities.<ref name="DNC organization" />

The DNC was established at the [[1848 Democratic National Convention]].<ref name="party1848">[http://www.democrats.org/a/party/history.html Party History]. Retrieved February 17, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104073023/http://www.democrats.org/a/party/history.html |date=November 4, 2006 }}</ref> The DNC's main counterpart is the [[Republican National Committee]].

==Role and organization==
The DNC is responsible for articulating and promoting the Democratic platform and coordinating party organizational activity. When the president is a Democrat, the party generally works closely with the president. In presidential elections, it supervises the national convention and, both independently and in coordination with the presidential candidate, raises funds, commissions polls, and coordinates campaign strategy. Following the selection of a party nominee, the public funding laws permit the national party to coordinate certain expenditures with the nominee, but additional funds are spent on general, party-building activities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Public Funding of Presidential Elections |publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]] |date=February 2005 |url= http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/pubfund.shtml#General |accessdate=October 29, 2006}}</ref> There are state committees in every state, as well as local committees in most cities, wards, and towns (and, in most states, counties).

The chairperson of the DNC is elected by vote of members of the Democratic National Committee.<ref name=charter>[https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/DNC-Charter-Bylaws-8.25.18-with-Amendments.pdf DNC 2018 Charter]</ref>{{rp|5}} The DNC is composed of the chairs and vice-chairs of each state Democratic Party's central committee, two hundred members apportioned among the states based on population and generally elected either on the ballot by primary voters or by the state Democratic Party committee, a number of elected officials serving in an [[ex officio member|ex officio]] capacity, and a variety of representatives of major Democratic Party constituencies.

[[File:Chicago delegation to the January 8, 1912 meeting of the Democratic National Committee.jpg|thumb|[[Chicago]] delegation to the January 8, 1912 Democratic National Committee]]
The DNC establishes rules for the [[caucus]]es and [[United States presidential primary|primaries]] which choose delegates to the [[Democratic National Convention]], but the caucuses and primaries themselves are most often run not by the DNC but instead by each individual state. Primary elections, in particular, are invariably conducted by state governments according to their own laws. Political parties may choose to participate or not participate in a state's primary election, but no political party executives have any jurisdiction over the dates of primary elections, or how they are conducted.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Outside of the process of nominating a presidential candidate, the DNC's role in actually selecting candidates to run on the party ticket is minimal.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

All DNC members are [[superdelegate]]s to the Democratic National Convention, and their role can affect the outcome over a close primary race. These delegates, officially described as "unpledged party leader and elected official delegates," fall into three categories based on other positions they hold:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demrulz.org/wp-content/files/12.15.14_2016_Delegate_Selection_Documents_Mailing_-_Rules_Call_Regs_Model_Plan_Checklist_12.15.14.pdf|title=Delegate Selection Materials For the 2016 Democratic National Convention|date=December 15, 2014 |accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref>
* elected members of the Democratic National Committee,
* sitting Democratic governors and members of Congress, and
* distinguished party leaders, consisting of current and former presidents, vice presidents, congressional leaders, and DNC chairs, are all superdelegates for life.

==Fundraising==

In 2005, the DNC led by [[Howard Dean]] introduced the Democracy Bonds program to promote small-donor fundraising.<ref>[http://www.democrats.org/democracybonds.html 2006 Democracy Bonds]. Retrieved on August 2, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813061632/http://www.democrats.org/democracybonds.html |date=August 13, 2007 }}</ref>

In the 2016 election cycle, the DNC raised a total of US$75,945,536 as of July 21, 2016. The three largest contributors were [[Renaissance Technologies]] (US$677,850), [[Newsweb Corporation]] (US$334,000), and [[Total Wine]] (US$298,100).<ref>{{cite web|title=Top Contributors DNC 2016 Election|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/parties/contrib.php?cmte=DNC&cycle=2016|website=OpenSecrets.org| publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]]|accessdate=3 August 2016|date=21 July 2016}}</ref>

In the 2020 election cycle, the DNC raised a total of US$107,030,025 as of June 23, 2020. The three largest contributors were [[Renaissance Technologies]] (US$910,000), [[Microsoft]] (US$897,423), and Art Advisors LLC (US$710,000).<ref>{{cite web |title=Democratic National Cmte |url=https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/contrib.php?cmte=DNC&cycle=2020 |website=OpenSecrets.org |publisher=Center for Responsive Politics |accessdate=23 June 2020}}</ref>

In June 2008, after Senator [[Barack Obama]] became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Dean announced that the DNC, emulating the Obama campaign, would no longer accept donations from federal lobbyists.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rhee |first=Foon |title=DNC bars Washington lobbyist money |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=June 5, 2008 |url= http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/06/dnc_bars_washin.html |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080715034652/http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/06/dnc_bars_washin.html |archive-date=July 15, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> In July 2015, during the 2016 election cycle, the DNC, led by [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]], reversed this policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/249052-dnc-to-allow-lobbyist-money-to-fund-conventions|title=DNC to allow lobbyist money to fund conventions|first=Elliot|last=Smilowitz|date= July 24, 2015|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref>

==Deputy Chairs==
The Deputy Chair of the Democratic National Committee was re-established by [[Tom Perez]] in February 2017 after his win in the [[Democratic National Committee chairmanship election, 2017|2017 DNC Chair race]].

After a close victory over Minnesota Congressman [[Keith Ellison]], Perez appointed Ellison as Deputy Chair in an attempt to lessen the divide in the Democratic Party after the contentious [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Democratic presidential primaries]], which saw conflicts between supporters of [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Bernie Sanders]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bradner|first1=Eric|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/25/politics/dnc-chair-election/|title=Perez wins DNC chairmanship|date=February 26, 2017|work=[[CNN]]|access-date=August 24, 2019}}</ref> Perez was seen as being more in line with the Clinton wing, while Ellison was more in line with the Sanders wing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/140847/case-tom-perez-makes-no-sense|title=The Case for Tom Perez Makes No Sense|author=Chang, Clio|date=February 23, 2017|accessdate=March 12, 2017|newspaper=[[The New Republic]]}}</ref> The role's revival in 2017 has been described by critics as largely titular and ceremonial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theslot.jezebel.com/thank-you-ida-b-wells-taught-us-and-we-walked-straigh-1792750809|title=Tom Perez Elected to Head DNC, Edging Out Keith Ellison|author=Evans, Lauren|date=February 25, 2017|accessdate=March 12, 2017|newspaper=[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]}}</ref>
