==History==
Juan Fernández Latorre founded ''La Voz de Galicia'' in 1882 as a republican, progressive newspaper. Consolidated in the republican era with a circulation of more than 20.000 daily copies, it was not until the 1960s, when Santiago Rey Fernandez-Latorre, the founder's grandson took over as manager, that ''La Voz'' began its expansion.

In May 2010, ''La Voz'' started a Digital Terrestrial Television station V Televisión. The Fundación Santiago Rey Fernández-Latorre manages, besides the museum, the programs of Voz Natura and Prensa-Escuela.

In 1993 the circulation of ''La Voz'' was 107,446 copies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Edward F.

==Political allegiance==
Like the majority of Galician newspapers, ''La Voz de Galicia'' relies on regional government subsidies for its survival, heavily compromising its editorial independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://anavedasideas.blogaliza.org/2011/03/22/os-medios-de-comunicacion-galegos-segundo-anton-fernandez-escuredo/ |title=Os medios de comunicación galegos segundo Antón Fernández Escuredo |date=22 March 2011 |access-date=28 September 2018 |work=A Nave Das Ideas |language=gl |publisher=[[WordPress]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401213642/http://anavedasideas.blogaliza.org/2011/03/22/os-medios-de-comunicacion-galegos-segundo-anton-fernandez-escuredo/ |archive-date=1 April 2018}}</ref>  Following the [[Galician parliamentary election, 2009|2009 Galician parliamentary elections]] in which the center-right [[People's Party of Galicia]] defeated the center-left [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]]-[[Bloque Nacionalista Galego]] coalition, the newspaper was awarded more than 4 million euros in subsidies. Other Galician media, like the defunct newspaper ''Xornal de Galicia'', born to compete with ''La Voz de Galicia'', claimed that this was reward for its political bias towards the ruling People's Party.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.xornal.com/artigo/2009/08/14/sociedad/comunicacion/voz-faro-reciben-nuevas-ayudas-publicas-prensa/2009081421062580322.html |title=La Voz y Faro reciben el 55% de las nuevas ayudas públicas a la prensa |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727201735/http://www.xornal.com/artigo/2009/08/14/sociedad/comunicacion/voz-faro-reciben-nuevas-ayudas-publicas-prensa/2009081421062580322.html |archive-date=27 July 2010 |date=14 August 2009 |access-date=28 September 2018 |journal=Xornal |language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnN-P2aV5uEC&pg=PA406 |title=Historia de la empresa de La Voz de Galicia |first=Aurora |last=Garcia Gonzalez |publisher=LibrosEnRed |year=2009 |page=406 |isbn=9781597544641}}</ref> This kept the paper alive, while other media disappeared because they lacked the financial support that they were entitled to as Galician language papers (the Spanish government provides extra funding to regions with several official languages in order to support their promotion).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://elpais.com/diario/2010/09/01/galicia/1283336300_850215.html |title='A Nosa Terra' se vuelve virtual |date=1 September 2010 |access-date=28 September 2018 |first=Paola |last=Obelleiro |location=A Coruña |language=es |newspaper=[[El País]] |publisher=[[Prisa]]}}</ref>

==Editions==
The newspaper publishes 14 editions every day, carried out by journalists from 26 different areas and resources (branch offices, sub-branches and correspondents) which allows the reader to obtain the closest information on everyday reality. Each edition is singled out by an insert within the newspaper which gathers all local information, a specific first page for each area and targeted information within the main body of the newspaper, specially in the sports section. This personalization implies the production of nearly 400 daily pages processed by the editorial staff and the printing department, of these the reader gets to see an average of 96 pages in his local edition.

With the opening of the Ferrol branch office in 1953, ''La Voz de Galicia'' was the first newspaper to undertake this editorial system which served as model to other newspapers outside Galicia. From that moment on, the expansion was carried out in various phases. In 1959 the Santiago branch was opened, in 1964 the one in Carballo and so on up to 1978, when the seven Galician cities had their own local editorial office. By 1990 the other main regions were also covered and short after the editorial staff office in Madrid was inaugurated, city that has a numerous Galician population.

This territorial organization allows ''La Voz de Galicia'' to have representatives in these areas in order to meet the necessities and interests of each city and region: the delegates are who manage the manpower appointed to each branch office and who defend the interests of the Corporación Voz and its readers.

''La Voz'' has also a weekly supplement, ''Golfiño''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Antonio J.
