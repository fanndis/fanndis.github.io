{{short description|Music albums released with little or no prior publicity}}
A '''surprise album''' or '''surprise release''' refers to the release of an [[album]] with little or no prior announcement, marketing or promotion.<ref name="diymag-3.25.19"/> The strategy contrasts traditional album releases, which typically feature weeks or months of advertising in the form of singles, music videos, tour announcements and album pre-sales. Often, the release of a surprise album is the formal announcement of its release. This strategy developed in part due to the prevalence of album [[Internet leak|leak]]s on the Internet during the 2000s.

== History ==
[[File:Radiohead France 2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Radiohead]] on tour for their 2007 surprise album ''[[In Rainbows]]'']]

The English rock band [[Radiohead]]'s 2007 studio album ''[[In Rainbows]]'' is often credited as the first surprise album.<ref name="gigwise-5.20.16" /><ref name="diymag-3.25.19" /><ref name="themusicnetwork-9.29.19" /><ref name="consequenceofsound-5.5.16" /> Shortly after the release, Radiohead's bassist Colin Greenwood stated the band had several motivations behind the album's release format, including the increased popularity of the internet as a tool for discovering music, frustrations with the traditional release and promotion format, the freedom of not being signed to a record label at the time, a desire to do something special and unique, and an interest in broadcasting their music directly to listeners globally at the same time.<ref name="index-9.13.10" /> It also served as a countermeasure to [[Internet leak]]s of albums, which had become prevalent at the time.<ref name="diymag-3.25.19"/> ''In Rainbows'' is also credited for starting the [[Pay what you want|pay-what-you-want]] model.<ref name="consequenceofsound-5.5.16" />

After ending a tumultuous relationship with Interscope Records in 2007, [[Nine Inch Nails]] independently released ''[[Ghosts I–IV]]'' and ''[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]'' in 2008. Both were released for free (with the option to purchase higher-quality digital or physical editions) and were released under a [[Creative Commons license]] to allow fans the ability to edit and remix the new music as they desired.<ref name="nytimes-5.6.08" /> Nine Inch Nails manager Jim Guerinot said the idea to release the albums without prior announcement was to pre-empt a leak and control the marketing, stating: "Internet searches peak around the leak, not around the single or the album. By the time the album comes out, it's done."<ref name="rollingstone-5.29.08" />

In 2011, American rappers [[Jay-Z]] and [[Kanye West]] advertised false release dates for their collaborative album ''[[Watch the Throne]]'', in part an effort to pre-empt leaks. This strategy inspired the singer [[Frank Ocean]] to surprise-release his second album ''[[Channel Orange]]'' one week earlier than its publicized release date.<ref name="udiscover-6.2.19" />

[[File:Beyoncé e Jay-Z.jpg|thumb|[[Beyoncé]] and [[Jay-Z]] (in 2009), the most popular implementers of the release strategy]]

Jay-Z and American singer [[Beyoncé]]<ref name="vulture-1.2.19" /> are often credited for popularizing the release strategy through multiple solo and collaborative releases. Beyoncé's 2013 self-titled album ''[[Beyoncé (album)|Beyoncé]]'' became the next most prominent surprise release after ''In Rainbows''. Harley Brown of ''[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]'' wrote, "Ever since Beyoncé's self-titled visual album appeared like a Christmas miracle on the iTunes store at midnight on a Thursday in December of 2013, the rules for how to release a record were rewritten literally overnight."<ref name="vulture-1.2.19" /> The singer would also adapt the release format for her follow-up album ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]'' in 2016. Jay-Z surprise released his 2017 album ''[[4:44]]'', and the following year the couple surprise released the collaborative album ''[[Everything Is Love]]'' as [[The Carters]].<ref name="diymag-3.25.19" />

Some surprise albums created controversy. In 2014, Irish rock band [[U2]] partnered with [[Apple Inc.]] to release their thirteenth studio album ''[[Songs of Innocence (U2 album)|Songs of Innocence]]'' through the [[iTunes Store]] at no cost to half a billion people. The album was automatically added to users' music libraries in [[iTunes]], which for those with automatic downloads enabled, resulted in an unprompted download of the album to their electronic devices. Many users did not want the album and several months after the release were frustrated that they could not delete the album from their devices.<ref name="diymag-3.25.19" /><ref name="yahoo-2.23.15" /> David Sackllah of ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' noted that "U2 and Apple deserve credit for thinking ambitiously, but they overestimated the band's relevance with fans, and many felt like the automatic download constituted an invasion of privacy."<ref name="consequenceofsound-5.5.16" />

In 2016, American R&B singer [[Frank Ocean]] surprised released his visual album ''[[Endless (Frank Ocean album)|Endless]]'', to complete his contract with [[Def Jam]], and quickly followed up with ''[[Blonde (Frank Ocean album)|Blonde]]'' a few days later independently, both as [[Apple Music]] exclusives. The act of Frank Ocean leaving Def Jam called into question surprise albums and exclusive digital releases. An anonymous Def Jam employee said to ''Buzzfeed'' at the time, "Our view is that giving exclusives to individual streaming platforms for long periods of time is not good for the artist, it's not good for the fans, and it limits the commercial opportunity for everybody involved."<ref name="buzzfeed-8.24.16" /> By 2019, ''Vulture'' and ''The Music Network'' published editorial articles questioning if the surprise album release format had peaked in popularity and effectiveness.<ref name="themusicnetwork-9.29.19" /><ref name="vulture-1.2.19" />

In 2020, American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]'s eighth studio album, [[Folklore (Taylor Swift album)|''Folklore'']], was released with less than 24 hours notice to much surprise among listeners and the music industry.<ref name="DIhQl"/> The record was created in isolation during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], under total secrecy; [[Republic Records]], Swift's record label, were let known about the project only few hours before its launch.<ref name="qUBmf" /> According to Elias Leight of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', while Swift had preferred traditional album-release cycles and was "a rare holdout" among major recording artists, ''Folklore''{{'}}s surprise release acknowledged that "the new class of winners release music steadily and adapt quickly to capitalize on sudden flashpoints, rather than trying to force those flashpoints to happen on any sort of regular, preordained schedule. If music industry success used to be all about muscle, now it's more about speed."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Leight|first=Elias|date=July 23, 2020|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/taylor-swift-folklore-surprise-album-1033102/|title=Taylor Swift Finally Abandoned the Traditional Album Rollout|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=September 4, 2020}}</ref>

== Reception ==
Rachel Finn of ''[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]'' said that while surprise albums were becoming too common to be truly surprising, "it gives artists breathing space to really make an impact and retain control over the way their music is released, pre-empting album leaks and taking their album out of the pre-album press cycle to let the music speak for itself."<ref name="diymag-3.25.19" /> Entrepreneur and freelance writer Cortney Harding wrote in a Medium article that while surprise albums give artists more flexibility, the strategy can usually only pay off for well-known musicians and can be problematic when the album is exclusive to a specific streaming service.<ref name="medium-8.5.16" /> David Sackllah of ''Consequence of Sound'' noted that while many major artists had attempted a surprise release, few had matched or surpassed the level of excitement of ''In Rainbows''.<ref name="consequenceofsound-5.5.16" /> Writing for ''The Ringer'', Lindsay Zoladz expressed criticism toward overuse of the term that began to dilute its meaning as music journalists were using "surprise album" to describe albums that were previously announced. Zoladz stated:

<blockquote>"'Surprise album' has become such a ubiquitous term that its meaning becomes more vague with each passing tweet. (Last month the ''Chicago Tribune'' even used it to describe [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]'s ''[[Views (album)|Views]]'', an album that not only had a previously announced release date, but which Drake himself had been teasing for the better part of two years.) But even when the phrase is used more precisely, it's becoming a bit hollow; we're living through a deluge of albums — even something as long promised as [[Rihanna]]'s ''[[Anti (album)|Anti]]'' — that lay claim to that trendy term 'surprise,' but have, like ''Lemonade'', given us a lot of hints that they were coming."<ref name="ringer-6.1.16" /></blockquote>
