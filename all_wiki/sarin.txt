Sarin is generally considered a [[weapon of mass destruction]]. Production and stockpiling of sarin was outlawed as of April 1997 by the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] of 1993, and it is classified as a [[List of Schedule 1 substances (CWC)|Schedule 1 substance]].

== Health effects ==
[[File:Sarin Biological effects.svg|thumbnail|150px|Sarin (red), acetylcholinesterase (yellow), acetylcholine (blue)]]
Like some other nerve agents that affect the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]], sarin attacks the [[nervous system]] by interfering with the degradation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at [[neuromuscular junction]]s. Death will usually occur as a result of [[asphyxia]] due to the inability to control the muscles involved in breathing.

Initial symptoms following exposure to sarin are a [[runny nose]], tightness in the chest, and [[Pupil constriction|constriction]] of the [[pupil]]s. Soon after, the person will have difficulty breathing and they will experience [[nausea]] and drooling. As they continue to lose control of bodily functions, they may vomit, defecate, and urinate. This phase is followed by [[Muscle contraction|twitching]] and jerking. Ultimately, the person becomes comatose and suffocates in a series of convulsive [[spasm]]s. Moreover, common mnemonics for the symptomatology of organophosphate poisoning, including sarin, are the "killer Bs" of [[bronchorrhea]] and [[bronchospasm]] because they are the leading cause of death,<ref>{{cite journal|first=Leon|last=Gussow|title= Nerve Agents: Three Mechanisms, Three Antidotes|journal=Emergency Medicine News|publisher=[[Wolters Kluwer]]|location=Alphen aan den Rijn, Netherlands|volume=27|issue=7|page=12|date=July 2005|doi=10.1097/00132981-200507000-00011}}</ref> and [[SLUDGE syndrome|SLUDGE]] – salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal distress, and emesis (vomiting). Death may follow in one to ten minutes after direct inhalation.

Sarin has a high [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] (ease with which a liquid can turn into vapour) relative to similar nerve agents, therefore inhalation is very easy and even vapor may immediately penetrate the skin. A person's clothing can release sarin for about 30 minutes after it has come in contact with sarin gas, which can lead to exposure of other people.<ref name="CDC">{{cite web|title=Facts About Sarin|url= https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/sarin/basics/facts.asp | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = November 18, 2015 | access-date = April 10, 2017}}</ref>

=== Management ===
Treatment measures have been described.<ref name=CDC /> Treatment is typically with the [[antidote]]s [[atropine]] and [[pralidoxime]].<ref name=niosh /> Atropine, an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] to [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, is given to treat the physiological symptoms of poisoning. Since muscular response to acetylcholine is mediated through [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, atropine does not counteract the muscular symptoms. Pralidoxime can regenerate [[cholinesterase]]s if administered within approximately five hours. [[Biperiden]], a synthetic [[acetylcholine antagonist]], has been suggested as an alternative to atropine due to its better [[blood–brain barrier]] penetration and higher efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shim|first=TM|author2=McDonough JH |title=Efficacy of biperiden and atropine as anticonvulsant treatment for organophosphorus nerve agent intoxication|journal=Archives of Toxicology|date=May 2000|volume=74|issue=3|pages=165–172|doi=10.1007/s002040050670|pmid=10877003|s2cid=13749842|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA385192}}</ref>

=== Mechanism of action ===
Specifically, sarin is a potent [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor|inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors =Abu-Qare AW, Abou-Donia MB |title=Sarin: health effects, metabolism, and methods of analysis |journal=[[Food and Chemical Toxicology]] |publisher=[[Elsevier]]|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1327–33 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12387297 |doi=10.1016/S0278-6915(02)00079-0 }}</ref> an enzyme that degrades the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]] after it is released into the [[synaptic cleft]]. In vertebrates, acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the neuromuscular junction, where signals are transmitted between [[neuron]]s from the [[central nervous system]] to muscle fibres. Normally, acetylcholine is released from the neuron to stimulate the muscle, after which it is degraded by [[acetylcholinesterase]], allowing the muscle to relax.  A build-up of acetylcholine in the [[synaptic cleft]], due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, means the neurotransmitter continues to act on the muscle fibre, so that any nerve impulses are effectively continually transmitted.

Sarin acts on acetylcholinesterase by forming a [[covalent bond]] with the particular [[serine]] residue at the active site. Fluoride is the [[leaving group]], and the resulting [[phosphothioester]] is robust and biologically inactive.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Millard CB, Kryger G, Ordentlich A, etal |title= Crystal Structures of Aged Phosphonylated Acetylcholinesterase: Nerve Agent Reaction Products at the Atomic Level |journal=Biochemistry |volume=38 |issue=22 |pages=7032–9 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10353814 |doi=10.1021/bi982678l |s2cid= 11744952 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/39c0183d5ef4da92c341b9cba7f8e07e70946584}}.

Its mechanism of action resembles that of some commonly used [[insecticide]]s, such as [[malathion]]. In terms of biological activity, it resembles [[carbamate]] insecticides, such as [[Carbaryl|Sevin]], and the medicines [[pyridostigmine]], [[neostigmine]], and [[physostigmine]].

=== Diagnostic tests ===
Controlled studies in healthy men have shown that a nontoxic 0.43&nbsp;mg oral dose administered in several portions over a 3-day interval caused average maximum depressions of 22 and 30%, respectively, in plasma and erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase levels. A single acute 0.5&nbsp;mg dose caused mild symptoms of intoxication and an average reduction of 38% in both measures of acetylcholinesterase activity. Sarin in blood is rapidly degraded either ''in vivo'' or ''in vitro''. Its primary inactive [[metabolite]]s have ''in vivo'' serum half-lives of approximately 24 hours. The serum level of unbound [[isopropylmethylphosphonic acid|isopropyl methylphosphonic acid]] (IMPA), a sarin [[hydrolysis]] product, ranged from 2–135&nbsp;μg/L in survivors of a terrorist attack during the first four hours post-exposure. Sarin or its metabolites may be determined in blood or urine by gas or liquid [[chromatography]], while acetylcholinesterase activity is usually measured by enzymatic methods.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Randall C.|last1=Baselt|first2=Robert H.|last2=Cravey|title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man|publisher=Biomedical Publications|location=Seal Beach, California|date=2017|isbn=978-0-8151-0547-3|pages=1926–1928|url=https://archive.org/details/dispositionoftox00base|url-access=registration}}</ref>

A newer method called "fluoride regeneration" or "fluoride reactivation" detects the presence of nerve agents for a longer period after exposure than the methods described above. Fluoride reactivation is a technique that has been explored since at least the early 2000s. This technique obviates some of the deficiencies of older procedures. Sarin not only reacts with the water in the blood plasma through hydrolysis (forming so-called 'free metabolites'), but also reacts with various proteins to form 'protein adducts'. These protein adducts are not so easily removed from the body, and remain for a longer period of time than the free metabolites. One clear advantage of this process is that the period, post-exposure, for determination of sarin exposure is much longer, possibly five to eight weeks according to at least one study.<ref>{{Cite report|url = http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a484093.pdf|title = Fluoride ion regeneration of sarin (GB) from minipig tissue and fluids following whole-body gb vapor exposure|date = July 2003|publisher = United States Army|last = Jakubowski |display-authors=etal }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/5/364.full.pdf|title = Improvements of the Fluoride Reactivation Method for the Verification of Nerve Agent Exposure|last = Degenhardt |display-authors=etal |date = July 2004|journal = [[Journal of Analytical Toxicology]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxfordshire, England|volume = 28|issue = 5|pages = 364–371|doi = 10.1093/jat/28.5.364 |pmid = 15239857}}</ref>

=== Toxicity ===

Sarin is highly toxic, whether by contact with the skin or breathed in. The toxicity of sarin in humans is largely based on calculations from studies with animals. The lethal concentration of sarin in air is approximately 28 – 35&nbsp;mg per cubic meter per minute for a two-minute exposure time by a healthy adult breathing normally (exchanging 15 liters of air per minute, lower 28 mg/m<sup>3</sup> value is for general population).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQqWDwAAQBAJ&q=exponent+lethality+vx&pg=PA174|title=Chemical Warfare Agents: Biomedical and Psychological Effects, Medical Countermeasures, and Emergency Response|last1=Lukey|first1=Brian J.|last2=Jr|first2=James A.

== Production and structure ==
Sarin is a [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] molecule because it has four chemically distinct [[substituents]] attached to the [[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]] phosphorus center.<ref>{{cite book|first=D.

At high [[pH|p''H'']], sarin decomposes rapidly to nontoxic [[phosphonic acid]] derivatives.<ref name = FAS />

It is usually manufactured and weaponized as a [[racemic mixture]] (a 1:1 mixture of its two enantiomeric forms) as this involves a simpler [[chemical synthesis|synthetic process]] whilst providing an adequate weapon.<ref name = enantiomers1 /><ref name = enantiomers2 />

A number of production pathways can be used to create sarin. The final reaction typically involves attachment of the isopropoxy group to the phosphorus with an [[alcoholysis]] with [[isopropyl alcohol]]. Two variants of this process are common. One is the reaction of [[methylphosphonyl difluoride]] with isopropyl alcohol, which produces a racemic mixture of sarin enantiomers with [[hydrofluoric acid]] as a byproduct:<ref name = FAS />

:[[File:Sarin synth with racemic stereochemistry.png|415px]]

The second process, uses equal quantities of [[methylphosphonyl difluoride]] and [[methylphosphonic acid dichloride]], a mixture "Di-Di" in this process, rather than just the difluoride.  This reaction also gives sarin, but [[hydrochloric acid]] as a byproduct instead. The Di-Di process was used by the United States for the production of its unitary sarin stockpile.<ref name = FAS>{{Cite book|chapter-url = https://fas.org/irp/threat/mctl98-2/p2sec04.pdf|chapter = Chemical Weapons Technology|access-date = September 4, 2020|via = [[Federation of American Scientists]]|title = The Militarily Critical Technologies List Part II: Weapons of Mass Destruction Technologies (ADA 330102)|publisher = [[U.S. Department of Defense]]|author = Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology|date = February 1998}}</ref>

The scheme below shows a generic example of Di-Di process; in reality, the selection of reagents and reaction conditions dictate both product structure and yield.  The choice of enantiomer of the mixed chloro fluoro intermediate displayed in the diagram is arbitrary, but the final substitution is selective for chloro over fluoro as the [[leaving group]]. Inert atmosphere and anhydrous conditions ([[Schlenk line#Techniques|Schlenk techniques]]) are used for synthesis of sarin and other organophosphates.<ref name = FAS />

As both reactions leave considerable acid in the product, and consequently sarin produced in bulk by these methods has a short half life without further processing, and would be corrosive to containers and damaging to weapons systems. Various methods have been tried to resolve these problems. In addition to industrial [[refining]] techniques to purify the chemical itself, various additives have been tried to combat the effects of the acid, such as:
* [[Tributylamine]] was added to US sarin produced at [[Rocky Mountain Arsenal]].<ref name="auto">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.wood.army.mil/chmdsd/images/pdfs/Jan-June%202006/Kirby-Nerve%20Gas.pdf|title = Nerve Gas: America's Fifteen Year Struggle for Modern Chemical weapons|last = Kirby|first = Reid|date = January 2006|journal = [[Army Chemical Review]]}}</ref>

Another byproduct of these two chemical processes is [[diisopropyl methylphosphonate]], formed when a second isopropyl alcohol reacts with the sarin itself. This chemical degrades into isopropyl methylphosphonic acid.<ref>{{cite web |work=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] |url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=967&tid=203 |title=Toxic Substances Portal – Diisopropyl Methylphosphonate (DIMP)}}</ref>

== Degradation and shelf life ==
[[File:Sarin test rabbit.jpg|thumb|upright|Rabbit used to check for leaks at former sarin production plant ([[Rocky Mountain Arsenal]]), 1970]]

The most important chemical reactions of phosphoryl halides is the hydrolysis of the bond between phosphorus and the fluoride. This P-F bond is easily broken by nucleophilic agents, such as water and [[hydroxide]]. At high [[pH]], sarin decomposes rapidly to nontoxic [[phosphonic acid]] derivatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opcw.org/about-chemical-weapons/types-of-chemical-agent/nerve-agents/|title=Nerve agents|publisher=OPCW}}</ref><ref>{{Housecroft1st|page=317}}</ref> The initial breakdown of sarin is into isopropyl methylphosphonic acid (IMPA), a chemical that is not commonly found in nature except as a breakdown product of sarin (this is useful for detecting the recent deployment of sarin as a weapon). IMPA then degrades into [[methylphosphonic acid]] (MPA), which can also be produced by other organophosphates.<ref>Ian Sample, ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 17, 2013, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/17/sarin-deadly-history-nerve-agent-syria-un Sarin: the deadly history of the nerve agent used in Syria]</ref>

Sarin with residual acid degrades after a period of several weeks to several months. The shelf life can be shortened by impurities in [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor materials]]. According to the [[CIA]], some [[Iraqi chemical weapons program|Iraqi sarin]] had a shelf life of only a few weeks, owing mostly to impure precursors.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|date=July 15, 1996|url=https://fas.org/irp/gulf/cia/960715/72569.htm|title=Stability of Iraq's Chemical Weapon Stockpile|access-date=August 3, 2007}}</ref>

Along with nerve agents such as [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]] and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], sarin can have a short shelf life. Therefore, it is usually stored as two separate precursors that produce sarin when combined.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/sarin-nerve-agent.html | title = Key Points on Sarin: The 'Most Volatile' of Nerve Agents | author = Russell Goldmanpril | date = April 6, 2017 | newspaper = New York Times}}</ref>  Sarin's shelf life can be extended by increasing the purity of the precursor and intermediates and incorporating [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizers]] such as [[tributylamine]]. In some formulations, tributylamine is replaced by [[diisopropylcarbodiimide]] (DIC), allowing sarin to be stored in [[aluminium]] casings. In [[binary chemical weapon]]s, the two precursors are stored separately in the same [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] and mixed to form the agent immediately before or when the shell is in flight. This approach has the dual benefit of solving the stability issue and increasing the safety of sarin munitions.

== History ==

Sarin was discovered in 1938 in [[Wuppertal]]-Elberfeld in Germany by scientists at [[IG Farben]] who were attempting to create stronger pesticides; it is the most toxic of the four [[Nerve agent#G-Series|G-Series nerve agents]] made by Germany. The compound, which followed the discovery of the [[nerve agent]] [[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], was named in honor of its discoverers: [[Gerhard Schrader|'''S'''chrader]], [[Otto Ambros|'''A'''mbros]], Gerhard '''R'''itter, and von der L'''in'''de.<ref name="Evans2008">{{cite book

=== Use as a weapon ===

In mid-1939, the formula for the agent was passed to the [[chemical warfare]] section of the [[German Army Weapons Office]], which ordered that it be brought into mass production for wartime use. Pilot plants were built, and a high-production facility was under construction (but was not finished) by the end of [[World War II]]. Estimates for total sarin production by [[Nazi Germany]] range from 500&nbsp;kg to 10&nbsp;tons.<ref>{{cite news

* 1950s (early): [[NATO]] adopted sarin as a standard chemical weapon, and both the USSR and the United States produced sarin for military purposes.
* 1953: 20-year-old [[Ronald Maddison]], a [[Royal Air Force]] engineer from [[Consett]], [[County Durham]], died in human testing of sarin at the [[Porton Down]] chemical warfare testing facility in [[Wiltshire]], England. Ten days after his death an [[inquest]] was held in secret which returned a verdict of [[Death by misadventure|misadventure]]. In 2004, the inquest was reopened and, after a 64-day inquest hearing, the jury ruled that Maddison had been unlawfully killed by the "application of a nerve agent in a non-therapeutic experiment".<ref>{{cite news
