The '''coronation of Elizabeth II''' took place on 2 June 1953 at [[Westminster Abbey]], London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/2/newsid_2654000/2654501.stm |title=1953: Queen Elizabeth takes coronation oath|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 May 2018}}</ref> [[Elizabeth II]] acceded to the throne at the age of 25 upon the death of her father, [[George VI]], on 6 February 1952, being [[Proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II|proclaimed queen]] by her privy and executive councils shortly afterwards.

Celebrations took place across the [[Commonwealth realm]]s and a [[Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal|commemorative medal]] was issued. It was the only British coronation to be fully televised; television cameras had not been allowed inside the abbey during [[Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth|her father's coronation]] in 1937. Elizabeth's was the fourth and last British coronation of the 20th century. It was estimated to have cost £1.57 million (c. £43,427,400 in 2019).

The committees involved [[high commissioner (Commonwealth)|high commissioner]]s from other Commonwealth realms, reflecting the international nature of the coronation; however, officials from other Commonwealth realms declined invitations to participate in the event because the governments of those countries considered the ceremony to be a religious rite unique to Britain. As Canadian Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]] said at the time: "In my view the Coronation is the official enthronement of the Sovereign as Sovereign of the UK. We are happy to attend and witness the Coronation of the Sovereign of the UK but we are not direct participants in that function."<ref>{{Citation| last=Trepanier| first=Peter| editor-last=Coates| editor-first=Colin M.| publication-date=2006| title=Majesty in Canada| contribution=A Not Unwilling Subject: Canada and Her Queen| publisher=Dundurn Press| location=Hamilton| pages=144–145| isbn=9781550025866| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FhFyvhpPx8MC| accessdate=16 October 2012| year=2006}}</ref> The Coronation Commission announced in June 1952 that the coronation would take place on 2 June 1953.<ref name="bousfield">{{Harvnb| Bousfield| 2002| p=77}}</ref>

[[Norman Hartnell]] was commissioned by the Queen to design the outfits for all members of the royal family, including [[Coronation gown of Elizabeth II|Elizabeth's coronation gown]]. His design for the gown evolved through nine proposals, and the final version resulted from his own research and numerous meetings with the Queen: a white silk dress embroidered with floral emblems of the countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] at the time: the [[Tudor rose]] of England, Scottish [[thistle]], Welsh [[leek]], [[shamrock]] for Northern Ireland, [[Acacia|wattle]] of Australia, [[maple leaf]] of Canada, the New Zealand [[silver fern]], South Africa's [[protea]], two [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus flowers]] for India and Ceylon, and Pakistan's wheat, cotton and [[jute]].<ref name=FE>{{cite web| url=http://www.fashion-era.com/coronation_dress.htm| last=Thomas| first=Pauline Weston| title=Coronation Gown of Queen Elizabeth II: The Queen's Robes, Part 2| publisher=Fashion-Era| accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nga.gov.au/ByAppointment/| last1=Cotton| first1=Belinda| last2=Ramsey| first2=Ron| title=By Appointment: Norman Hartnell's sample for the Coronation dress of Queen Elizabeth II| publisher=National Gallery of Australia| accessdate=12 February 2010| archive-url=https://archive.is/20120530044811/http://www.nga.gov.au/ByAppointment/| archive-date=30 May 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref>

Elizabeth rehearsed for the occasion with her maids of honour. A sheet was used in place of the velvet train, and a formation of chairs stood in for the carriage. She also wore the [[Imperial State Crown]] while going about her daily business – at her desk, during tea, and while reading a newspaper – so that she could become accustomed to its feel and weight.<ref name=FE /> Elizabeth took part in two full rehearsals at [[Westminster Abbey]], on 22 and 29 May,<ref>{{Cite book| last=McDowell| first=Colin| title=A Hundred Years of Royal Style| publisher=Muller, Blond & White| year=1985| location=London| page=[https://archive.org/details/hundredyearsofro00mcdo/page/70 70]| isbn=978-0-584-11071-5| url=https://archive.org/details/hundredyearsofro00mcdo/page/70}}</ref> though some sources claim that she attended one or "several" rehearsals.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Bradford| first=Sarah| title=Elizabeth: A Biography of Britain's Queen| publisher=Riverhead Trade| date=1 May 1997| location=London| page=[https://archive.org/details/elizabethbiograp00brad_0/page/186 186]| isbn=978-1-57322-600-4| url=https://archive.org/details/elizabethbiograp00brad_0/page/186}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last=Brooke-Little| first=John| title=Royal Ceremonies of State| publisher=Littlehampton Book Services Ltd.| year=1980| location=London| page=52| isbn=978-0-600-37628-6| ref=CITEREF_Brook-Little_1985}}</ref> The [[Lavinia Fitzalan-Howard, Duchess of Norfolk|Duchess of Norfolk]] usually stood in for the Queen at rehearsals.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The Coronation ceremony of Elizabeth II followed a pattern similar to the coronations of the kings and queens before her, being held in Westminster Abbey, and involving the [[peerage]] and clergy. However, for the new Queen, several parts of the ceremony were markedly different.

===Television===
Millions across Britain watched the coronation live on the [[BBC Television|BBC Television Service]], and many purchased or rented television sets for the event. The coronation of the Queen was the first to be televised in full; the BBC's cameras had not been allowed inside Westminster Abbey for her father's coronation in 1937, and had covered only the procession outside.<ref>{{Cite book| title=BBC Handbook 1938| publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation| year=1938| location=London| pages=38–39}}</ref> There had been considerable debate within the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]] on the subject, with [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] against the idea; but, Elizabeth refused his advice on this matter and insisted the event take place before television cameras,<ref name=HistUK>{{cite web| url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/England-History/TheCoronation1953.htm| title=The Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II| publisher=Historic UK| accessdate=20 December 2009}}</ref> as well as those filming with experimental [[3D film|3D technology]].{{refn|This footage was in 2010 used in the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s first [[3D television]] broadcast, the first time the images had been shown on television.<ref name=N1130 />|group=n|name=CBC}}<ref name=N1130>{{Cite news| last=Szklarski| first=Cassandra| title=Put on those specs, couch potatoes – 3D poised to reinvent TV: tech guru| publisher=News1130| date=10 June 2010| url=http://www.news1130.com/entertainment/article/65032--put-on-those-specs-couch-potatoes-3d-poised-to-reinvent-tv-tech-guru| accessdate=11 August 2010| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135255/http://www.news1130.com/entertainment/article/65032--put-on-those-specs-couch-potatoes-3d-poised-to-reinvent-tv-tech-guru| archivedate=17 July 2011| df=dmy-all}}</ref> The event was also filmed in colour, separately from the BBC's black and white television broadcast, where an average of 17 people watched each small TV.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early Color Television: British Experimental Field Sequential Color System|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/british_experimental.html |publisher=Early Television Museum|accessdate=23 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Television reigns: Broadcasting Queen Elizabeth's coronation |url=https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/television-reigns-broadcasting-queen-elizabeths-coronation |website=[[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20200103031130/https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects-and-stories/television-reigns-broadcasting-queen-elizabeths-coronation |archivedate=3 January 2020 |language=en |date=29 October 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Elizabeth's coronation was also the first major world event to be broadcast internationally on television. To make sure Canadians could see it on the same day, [[English Electric Canberra|RAF Canberras]] flew BBC [[Kinescope|film recordings]] of the ceremony across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to be broadcast by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]],<ref name="CBC1" /> the first non-stop flights between the United Kingdom and the Canadian mainland. At [[Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Goose Bay]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Labrador]], the first batch of film was transferred to a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] [[Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck|CF-100]] jet fighter for the further trip to [[Montreal]]. In all, three such flights were made as the coronation proceeded, with the first and second Canberras taking the second and third batches of film, respectively, to Montreal.<ref name="CBC2">{{cite web| url=http://archives.cbc.ca/society/monarchy/topics/70/| last=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation| authorlink=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation| title=Society > The Monarchy > Canada's New Queen > Coronation of Queen Elizabeth > Did You Know?| publisher=CBC| accessdate=17 December 2009}}</ref> The following day, a film was flown west to [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]], whose [[CBUT-DT|CBC Television affiliate]]  had yet to sign on. The film was escorted by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] to the [[Peace Arch Border Crossing]], where it was then escorted by the [[Washington State Patrol]] to [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], where it was shown as the inaugural broadcast of [[KVOS-TV]], a new  station whose signal reached into the [[Lower Mainland]] of [[British Columbia]], allowing viewers there to see the coronation as well, though on a one-day delay.

US networks [[NBC]] and [[CBS]] made similar arrangements to have films flown in relays back to the United States for same-day broadcast, but used slower propeller-driven aircraft. The struggling [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network arranged to re-transmit the CBC broadcast, taking the on-the-air signal from the CBC's Toronto station and feeding the network from ABC's affiliate in [[Buffalo, New York]] and, as a result, beat the other two networks to air by more than 90 minutes ⁠— and at considerably lower cost.

Although it did not as yet have full-time television service, film was also dispatched to Australia aboard a [[Qantas]] airliner, which arrived in Sydney in a record time of 53 hours 28 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airwaysmuseum.com/Fifty%20years%20ago%20-%201953.htm |title=Fifty Years Ago - 1953 |date=2003 |website= airwaysmuseum.com |publisher= The Civil Aviation Historical Society & Airways Museum |access-date= 12 August 2018 }}</ref> The worldwide television audience for the coronation was estimated to be 277 million.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/queen-s-coronation-made-history-for-canada-and-for-television-1.1315654 |title=Queen's coronation made history for Canada – and for television |last=Davison |first=Janet |date=2 June 2013 |website= www.cbc.ca |publisher= CBC News |access-date= 12 August 2018}}</ref>

When the Queen arrived at about 11:00&nbsp;am,<ref name=FE /><ref name=HistUK /> she found that the friction between her robes and the carpet caused her difficulty moving forward, and she said to the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Geoffrey Fisher]], "Get me started!"<ref name=HistUK /> Once going, the procession, which included the various [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioners]] of the Commonwealth carrying banners bearing the shields of the coats of arms of their respective nations,<ref name=Bous78>{{Harvnb| Bousfield| 2002| p=78}}</ref> moved inside the abbey, up the central aisle and through the choir to the stage, as the choirs sang "[[I was glad]]", an imperial setting of [[Psalm 122]], vv.&nbsp;1–3, 6, and 7 by [[Sir Hubert Parry]].<ref name=ALL>{{cite web| url=http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/coronation/cor1953b.html| title=The Form and Order of Service that is to be performed and the Ceremonies that are to be observed in the Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the Abbey Church of St. Peter, Westminster, on Tuesday, the second day of June, 1953| publisher=An Anglican Liturgical Library| accessdate=15 December 2009| ref=CITEREF_An_Anglican_Liturgical_Library}}</ref> As Elizabeth prayed at and then seated herself on the Chair of Estate to the south of the altar, the Bishops carried in the religious paraphernalia—the [[bible]], [[paten]] and [[chalice (cup)|chalice]]—and the peers holding the coronation regalia handed them over to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who, in turn, passed them to the [[List of Deans of Westminster|Dean of Westminster]], [[Alan Campbell Don]], to be placed on the altar.<ref>{{Harvnb| An Anglican Liturgical Library| loc=II}}</ref>

[[File:Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II Couronnement de la Reine Elizabeth II.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Elizabeth proceeding past the Coronation Chair]]
After the Queen moved to stand before [[King Edward's Chair]] (Coronation Chair), she turned, following as Fisher, along with the [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor]] of Great Britain ([[Gavin Simonds, 1st Viscount Simonds|the Viscount Simonds]]), [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] of England (the [[George Cholmondeley, 5th Marquess of Cholmondeley|Marquess of Cholmondeley]]), [[Lord High Constable of England]] ([[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|the Viscount Alanbrooke]]) and [[Earl Marshal]] of the United Kingdom (the [[Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]]), all led by the [[Garter Principal King of Arms]] ([[George Bellew]]), asked the audience in each direction of the compass separately: "Sirs, I here present unto you Queen Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen: wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage and service, are you willing to do the same?" The crowd would reply "God save Queen Elizabeth!" every time,<ref>{{Harvnb| An Anglican Liturgical Library| loc=III}}</ref> to each of which the Queen would curtsey in return.<ref name=Bous78 />

Seated again on the Chair of Estate, Elizabeth then took the Coronation Oath as administered by the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the lengthy oath, the Queen swore to govern each of her countries according to their respective laws and customs, to mete out law and justice with mercy, to uphold [[Protestantism]] in the United Kingdom and protect the Church of England and preserve its bishops and clergy. She proceeded to the altar where she stated, "The things which I have here promised, I will perform, and keep. So help me God", before kissing the Bible and putting the [[royal sign-manual]] to the oath as the Bible was returned to the Dean of Westminster.<ref>{{Harvnb| An Anglican Liturgical Library| loc=IV}}</ref> From him the [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], James Pitt-Watson, took the Bible and presented it to the Queen again, saying,
{{quote|Our gracious Queen: to keep your Majesty ever mindful of the law and the Gospel of God as the Rule for the whole life and government of Christian Princes, we present you with this Book, the most valuable thing that this world affords. Here is Wisdom; This is the royal Law; These are the lively Oracles of God.}}
Elizabeth returned the book to Pitt-Watson, who placed it back with the Dean of Westminster.<ref>{{Harvnb| An Anglican Liturgical Library| loc=V}}</ref>

[[File:Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom 1952-12-13.jpg|thumb|[[St Edward's Crown]], the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom#Orbs|Orb]], the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom#Sceptres|Sceptre]] with Cross, Sceptre with Dove, and the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom#Rings|Ring]]]]
The [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] service was then conducted, involving prayers by both the clergy and Elizabeth, Fisher asking, "O God... Grant unto this thy servant Elizabeth, our Queen, the spirit of wisdom and government, that being devoted unto thee with her whole heart, she may so wisely govern, that in her time thy Church may be in safety, and Christian devotion may continue in peace", before reading various excerpts from the [[First Epistle of Peter]], Psalms, and the [[Gospel of Matthew]].<ref>{{Harvnb| An Anglican Liturgical Library| loc=VI}}</ref> Elizabeth was then [[Anointing|anointed]] as the choir sang "[[Zadok the Priest]]"; the Queen's jewellery and crimson cape were removed by the Earl of Ancaster and the [[Mistress of the Robes]],<ref name=FE /> [[Mary Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|the Duchess of Devonshire]] and, wearing only a simple, white linen dress also designed by Hartnell to completely cover the coronation gown, she moved to be seated in the Coronation Chair. There, Fisher, assisted by the Dean of Westminster, made a cross on the Queen's forehead with [[Holy anointing oil|holy oil]] made from the same base as had been used in the coronation of her father.<ref name=HistUK />  At the Queen's request, the actual anointing ceremony was not televised.<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-22764987</ref>

From the altar, the Dean passed to the Lord Great Chamberlain the [[spur]]s, which were presented to the Queen and then placed back on the altar. The [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom#Swords|Sword of State]] was then handed to Elizabeth, who, after a prayer was uttered by Fisher, placed it herself on the altar, and the peer who had been previously holding it took it back again after paying a sum of 100 [[British shilling coin|shillings]].<ref>{{Harvnb| An Anglican Liturgical Library| loc=VIII}}</ref> The Queen was then invested with the [[Armill]]s (bracelets), Stole Royal, Robe Royal and the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom#The orbs and sceptres|Sovereign's Orb]], followed by the Queen's Ring, the [[Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross]] and the [[Sovereign's Sceptre with Dove]]. With the first two items on and in her right hand and the latter in her left, Queen Elizabeth was crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury, with the crowd chanting "God save the queen!" three times at the exact moment [[St Edward's Crown]] touched the monarch's head. The princes and peers gathered then put on their coronets and a [[21-gun salute]] was fired from the [[Tower of London]].<ref>{{Harvnb| An Anglican Liturgical Library| loc=IX–XI}}</ref>
[[File:Queencrown.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], swears allegiance to his wife]]

With the benediction read, Elizabeth moved to the throne and the Archbishop of Canterbury and all the Bishops offered to her their fealty, after which, while the choir sang, the peers of the United Kingdom—led by the royal peers: the Queen's husband; [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]]; and [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]]—each proceeded, in order of precedence, to pay their personal homage and allegiance to Elizabeth.

When the last baron had completed this task, the assembly shouted "God save Queen Elizabeth. Long live Queen Elizabeth. May the Queen live for ever!"<ref>{{Harvnb| An Anglican Liturgical Library| loc=XII–XIV}}</ref> Having removed all her royal regalia, Elizabeth knelt and took the communion, including a general [[Confession (religion)|confession]] and [[absolution]], and, along with the congregation, recited the [[Lord's Prayer]].<ref>{{Harvnb| An Anglican Liturgical Library| loc=XV}}</ref>

Now wearing the Imperial State Crown and holding the Sceptre with the Cross and the Orb, and as the gathered guests sang "[[God Save the Queen]]", Elizabeth left Westminster Abbey through the nave and apse, out the Great West Door.

===Music===
[[File:Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II - Couronnement de la Reine Elizabeth II (7195940764).jpg|thumbnail|Appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after the coronation]]

Although many had assumed that the [[Master of the Queen's Musick]], [[Arnold Bax]], would be the director of music for the coronation, it was decided instead to appoint the organist and master of the choristers at the abbey, [[William McKie (musician)|William McKie]], who had been in charge of music at the [[Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh|royal wedding]] in 1947. McKie convened an advisory committee with Arnold Bax and [[Ernest Bullock|Sir Ernest Bullock]], who had directed the music for the previous coronation.<ref>{{cite book| last=Wilkinson| first=James| title=The Queen's Coronation: The Inside Story| publisher= Scala Publishers Ltd.| page=24| year=2011| isbn=978-1-85759-735-6}}</ref>

When it came to choosing the music, tradition required that Handel's "[[Zadok the Priest]]" and Parry's "[[I was glad]]" were included amongst the [[anthem]]s. Other choral works included were the 16th century "Rejoice in the Lord alway" and [[Samuel Sebastian Wesley]]'s "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace". Another tradition was that new work be commissioned from the leading composers of the day: [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] composed a new [[motet]] "O Taste and See", [[William Walton]] composed a setting for the "[[Te Deum]]", and the Canadian composer [[Healey Willan]] wrote an anthem [[Psalm 8|"O Lord our Governor"]].<ref name=McCreery49 /><ref>{{harvnb| Wilkinson| 2011| p=27}}</ref> Four new orchestral pieces were planned; [[Arthur Bliss]] composed "Processional"; William Walton, "[[Orb and Sceptre]]"; and Arnold Bax, "Coronation March". [[Benjamin Britten]] had agreed to compose a piece, but he caught influenza and then had to deal with flooding at [[Aldeburgh]], so nothing was forthcoming. [[Edward Elgar]]'s "[[Pomp and Circumstance Marches#March No. 1 in D|Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 in D]]" was played immediately before Bax's march at the end of the ceremony.<ref name="Wilkinson 2011 28">{{harvnb| Wilkinson| 2011| p=28}}</ref> An innovation, at the suggestion of Vaughan Williams, was the inclusion of a [[hymn]] in which the congregation could participate. This proved controversial and was not included in the programme until the Queen had been consulted and found to be in favour; Vaughan Williams wrote an elaborate arrangement of the traditional Scottish [[Metrical psalter|metrical psalm]], "[[Old 100th]]", which included military trumpet fanfares<ref>{{harvnb| Wilkinson| 2011| p=25}}</ref> and was sung before the communion.<ref name=ALL /> [[Gordon Jacob]] wrote a choral arrangement of [[God Save the Queen]], also with trumpet fanfares.<ref>{{cite book |last=Range |first=Matthias |date=2012 |title=Music and Ceremonial at British Coronations: From James I to Elizabeth II |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_rIgAwAAQBAJ&q=Gordon+Jacob+%22God+Save+the+Queen%22&pg=PA323 |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages= 256–257 |isbn= 978-1-107-02344-4 }}</ref>

The choir for the coronation was a combination of the choirs of Westminster Abbey, [[St Paul's Cathedral]], the [[Chapels Royal#United Kingdom|Chapel Royal]], and [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|Saint George's Chapel, Windsor]]. In addition to those established choirs, the [[Royal School of Church Music]] conducted auditions to find twenty [[Boy soprano|boy trebles]] from [[parish church]] choirs representing the various regions of the United Kingdom. Along with twelve trebles chosen from various British [[cathedral]] choirs, the selected boys spent the month beforehand training at [[Addington Palace]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rscm.com/info_resources/news/Coronation.php| title=RSCM choristers at the Queen's Coronation in 1953| publisher=The Royal School of Church Music| accessdate=10 January 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110192206/http://www.rscm.com/info_resources/news/Coronation.php| archive-date=10 January 2014| url-status=dead}}</ref> The final complement of choristers comprised 182 boy trebles, 37 male [[alto]]s, 62 [[tenor]]s and 67 [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]es. Together with a full orchestra, conducted by Sir Adrian Boult, the total number of musicians was 480.<ref name="Wilkinson 2011 28"/>

==Coronation review of the fleet==
[[File:Göta Lejon and Sverdlov Cruiser.jpg|thumb|right|Warships from Sweden (right) and the Soviet Union at the fleet review]]
On 15 June 1953, the Queen attended a [[Fleet review (Commonwealth realms)|fleet review]] at [[Spithead]], off the coast at [[Portsmouth]]. There were more Commonwealth naval ships present than at the 1937 coronation review, though a third of them were [[frigate]]s or smaller vessels. Major [[Royal Navy]] units included Britain's last [[battleship]], {{HMS|Vanguard|23|6}}, and four fleet and three light [[aircraft carrier]]s. The [[Royal Australian Navy]] and the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] also each included a light carrier in their contingents ({{HMAS|Sydney|R17}} and {{HMCS|Magnificent |CVL 21}}).<ref>{{cite book| last=Willmott| first=H P| date=2010| title=The Last Century of Sea Power: From Washington to Tokyo, 1922–1945| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AiIL5icXqMC&q=coronation+review+of+the+fleet+1953&pg=PA25| location=Bloomington| publisher=Indiana University Press| page=25| isbn=978-0-253-35214-9| accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref> Using the frigate {{HMS|Surprise|K346|6}} as a [[royal yacht]], the Queen and royal family started to review the lines of anchored ships at 3:30&nbsp;p.m., finally anchoring at 5:10&nbsp;p.m. This was followed by a fly-past of some 300 naval aircraft. After the Queen transferred to ''Vanguard'' for dinner, the day concluded with the Illumination of the fleet and a fireworks display.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cloudobservers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2013/05/07.-Jul-Spithead-Review-1953.pdf| title=Coronation Review of the Fleet| last=Day| first=A.| date=22 May 1953| publisher=Cloud Observers Association| accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>
