===Obama administration===
[[File:James Steinberg and Yukio Edano 20110127.jpg|thumb|200px|with [[Yukio Edano]] (January 27, 2011)]]
According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Steinberg, along with [[Daniel C. Kurtzer]] and [[Dennis Ross]], were among the principal authors of [[Barack Obama]]’s address on the [[Middle East]] to AIPAC in June 2008, which was viewed as the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominee’s most expansive on [[international relations|international affairs]].<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121358442119676435 Obama's Mideast Experts Emphasize Talks], Jay Solomon, [[The Wall Street Journal]], June 16, 2008; Page A7</ref>

He was mentioned as being "at the top" of Obama's list of candidates for the post of [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]],<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/us/politics/06web-cooper.html?partner=permalink&exprod=permalink Want a Security Post?

As Deputy Secretary of State and principal Deputy to US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]],<ref name="state.gov"/> Steinberg notably coined the phrase "[[strategic reassurance]]" to describe [[China–United States relations]] suggestive of the idea that the United States should reassure China about welcoming China's rise while China would reassure the US and its neighbors that it would not conflict with their interests.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704224004574488292885761628 |title=The Doctrine of 'Strategic Reassurance' |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=October 22, 2009 |first=Kelley |last=Currie }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/11/06/the_end_of_the_concept_of_strategic_reassurance |title=The end of the concept of "strategic reassurance"? |first=Josh |last=Rogin |date=November 6, 2009 |work=[[Foreign Policy]] }}</ref>

===Israel-U.S. strategic dialogue===
In October 2010, Steinberg met with [[Israel|Israel’s]] Deputy Foreign Minister, [[Danny Ayalon]], in [[Washington, D.C.]], where they discussed how to improve regional security and stability through boosting and growing the already strong cooperation between their two nations. During the talks, both delegates expressed their commitment to a lasting peace between Israel and its neighbors and their grave concern regarding Iran’s continued non-compliance with its international obligations through pursuit of a military nuclear program.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joint Statement on the U.S.-Israel Strategic Dialogue|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2010/10/149599.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}</ref>

The following spring, they met in Jerusalem where they again took advantage of the opportunity to work together to identify and strategize against the threats both countries face including the rapidly changing political situation in the [[Middle East]] and the ongoing Iranian nuclear program.<ref>{{cite web|title=Israel-U.S. Strategic Dialogue|url=http://www.dannyayalon.com/News/391/}}</ref>

===Maxwell School deanship===
In March 2011, Steinberg was named Dean of the [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]] at [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/03/30/steinberg_leaving_state_burns_moves_up |title=Steinberg leaving State, Burns moves up |first=Josh |last=Rogin |date=March 30, 2011 |work=[[Foreign Policy]] }}</ref> On July 28, 2011, he resigned as Deputy Secretary of State and assumed his new position.
