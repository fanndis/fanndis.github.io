'''The Episcopal Church''' ('''TEC''') is a member church of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] and is based in the United States with additional [[diocese]]s elsewhere. It is a [[Mainline Protestant|mainline]] [[Christianity|Christian]] denomination divided into nine [[Ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses of the Episcopal Church|provinces]]. The [[presiding bishop]] of the Episcopal Church is [[Michael Curry (bishop)|Michael Bruce Curry]], the first African-American [[bishop]] to serve in that position.

{{As of|2019|alt=In 2019|post=,}} the Episcopal Church had 1,798,042 baptized members, of whom 1,637,945 were in the United States.<ref name="stat2019"/> {{As of|2011|alt=In 2011|post=,}} it was the nation's 14th largest denomination.<ref name="NCC2011yearbook">{{Citation|publisher=National Council of Churches News Service|url=http://www.ncccusa.org/news/110210yearbook2011.html|title=Trends continue in church membership growth or decline, reports 2011 Yearbook of American & Canadian Churches|work=News from the National Council of Churches|publication-date=February 14, 2011|access-date=December 29, 2011|quote=14.

The church was organized after the [[American Revolution]], when it became separate from the [[Church of England]], whose clergy are required to swear allegiance to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] as [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]. The Episcopal Church describes itself as "[[Protestantism|Protestant]], yet [[Catholic (term)|Catholic]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/article/what-makes-us-anglican |title=What makes us Anglican? Hallmarks of the Episcopal Church |publisher=Episcopalchurch.org |access-date=June 1, 2016 }}</ref> The Episcopal Church claims [[apostolic succession]], tracing its bishops back to the [[apostles]] via [[holy orders]]. The ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', a collection of traditional [[rite]]s, blessings, [[Liturgy|liturgies]], and prayers used throughout the [[Anglican Communion]], is central to Episcopal worship.

The Episcopal Church was active in the [[Social Gospel]] movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{sfn|Bourgeois|2004}} Since the 1960s and 1970s, the church has pursued a decidedly more [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] course. It has opposed the [[death penalty]] and supported the [[civil rights movement]] and [[affirmative action]]. The church calls for the full legal equality of [[LGBT]] people. In 2015, the church's 78th triennial [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] passed resolutions allowing the blessing of [[same-sex marriage]]s and approved two official liturgies to bless such unions.<ref name="78th General Convention">{{cite web|work =Episcopal News Service |title =General Convention wrap-up: Historic actions, structural changes|date =July 7, 2015 |url = http://episcopaldigitalnetwork.com/ens/2015/07/07/general-convention-wrap-up-historic-actions-structural-changes/|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150802200740/http://episcopaldigitalnetwork.com/ens/2015/07/07/general-convention-wrap-up-historic-actions-structural-changes/ |archive-date = 2 August 2015}}</ref>

==Names==
[[File:Flag of the US Episcopal Church.svg|thumb|Flag of the Episcopal Church]]

"'''The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America'''" ('''PECUSA''') and "The Episcopal Church" (TEC) are both official names specified in the church's constitution.<ref name=CandC /> The latter is much more commonly used.<ref name="EnBr" /><ref name="ODCC" /><ref name="ColEn" /> In other languages, an equivalent is used. For example, in Spanish, the church is called ''La Iglesia Episcopal Protestante de los Estados Unidos de América'' or ''La Iglesia Episcopal''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/index_esn.htm|title=Episcopal Church webpage in Spanish|publisher=Episcopalchurch.org|access-date=2008-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214081055/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/index_esn.htm|archive-date=2005-12-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> and in French ''L'Église protestante épiscopale des États-Unis d'Amérique'' or ''L'Église épiscopale''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/index_fra.htm|title=Episcopal Church webpage in French|publisher=Episcopalchurch.org|access-date=2008-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212220807/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/index_fra.htm|archive-date=2006-12-12}}</ref>

Until 1964, "The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America" was the only official name in use. In the 19th century, [[High Church]] members advocated changing the name, which they felt did not acknowledge the church's Catholic heritage. They were opposed by the church's evangelical wing, which felt that the "Protestant Episcopal" label accurately reflected the Reformed character of Anglicanism. After 1877, alternative names were regularly proposed and rejected by the General Convention. One proposed alternative was "the American Catholic Church". By the 1960s, opposition to dropping the word "Protestant" had largely subsided. In a 1964 General Convention compromise, priests and [[layperson|lay]] delegates suggested adding a preamble to the church's constitution, recognizing "The Episcopal Church" as a lawful alternate designation while still retaining the earlier name.<ref name="White-Dykman4-6">{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Edwin|last2=Dykman|first2=Jackson|title=The Annotated Constitution and Canons for the Episcopal Church|year=1981|publisher=Church Publishing Incorporated|location=New York|isbn=978-0-89869-298-3|pages=4–6}}</ref>

The 66th General Convention voted in 1979 to use the name "The Episcopal Church" in the Oath of Conformity of the Declaration for Ordination.<ref>{{cite web|title=Acts of Convention # 1979-A125|url=http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=1979-A125 |date=1979}}</ref> The evolution of the name can be seen in the church's Book of Common Prayer. In the 1928 BCP, the title page read, "According to the use of The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America", whereas on the title page of the 1979 BCP it states, "'According to the use of The Episcopal Church".{{sfn|Zahl|1998|pp=56, 69|ps=: "Protestant consciousness within ECUSA, which used to be called PECUSA (i.e., the Protestant Episcopal Church in the U.S.A.) is moribund […] With the approval and lightning ascent of the 1979 Prayer Book came to the end, for all practical purposes, of Protestant churchmanship in what is now known aggressively as ECUSA".}}

The Episcopal Church in the United States of America (ECUSA) has never been an official name of the church but is an alternative commonly seen in English. Since several other churches in the Anglican Communion also use the name "Episcopal", including [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Scotland]] and the [[Episcopal Church in the Philippines|Philippines]], some, for example [[Anglicans Online]], add the phrase "in the United States of America".<ref name=Anglicansonline>{{cite web|url=http://morgue.anglicansonline.org/061029/|title=Anglicans Online&#124;The online centre of the Anglican / Episcopal world|publisher=Morgue.anglicansonline.org|access-date=February 28, 2015}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of the Episcopal Church (United States)}}

===Colonial era===
[[File:Newport parish west facade.jpg|thumb|[[St. Luke's Church (Smithfield, Virginia)|St. Luke's Church]], built during the 17th century near [[Smithfield, Virginia]] - the oldest Anglican church-building to have survived largely intact in North America.]]
The Episcopal Church has its origins in the [[Church of England]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]], and it stresses continuity with the early universal [[Western Church]] and claims to maintain [[apostolic succession]] (though the Catholic and Orthodox churches do not recognize this claim).{{sfn|Sydnor|1980|p=64}}

The first [[parish]] was founded in [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1607, under the charter of the [[Virginia Company of London]]. The tower of [[Jamestown Church]] ({{circa}}  1639–43) is one of the oldest surviving Anglican church structures in the United States. The Jamestown church building itself is a modern reconstruction.{{sfn|Sydnor|1980|p=72}}

Although no American Anglican bishops existed in the colonial era, the Church of England had an official status in several colonies, which meant that local governments paid tax money to local parishes, and the parishes handled some civic functions. The Church of England was designated the [[established church]] in [[History of Virginia#Established Church|Virginia]] in 1609, in [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1693, in [[History of Maryland|Maryland]] in 1702, in [[History of South Carolina|South Carolina]] in 1706, in [[History of North Carolina|North Carolina]] in 1730, and in [[History of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1758.{{sfn|Douglas|2005|p=188}}

From 1635 the [[vestry|vestries]] and the clergy came loosely under the diocesan authority of the [[Bishop of London]]. After 1702, the [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]] (SPG) began missionary activity throughout the colonies. On the eve of [[American Revolution|Revolution]] about 400 independent congregations were reported{{by whom|date=March 2017}} throughout the colonies.

[[File:Colonial Williamsburg Parish Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bruton Parish Church]] in [[Colonial Williamsburg]], established in 1674. The current building was completed in 1715.]]

===Revolutionary era===
Embracing the symbols of the British presence in the American colonies, such as the monarchy, the episcopate, and even the language of the ''Book of Common Prayer'', the Church of England almost drove itself to extinction during the upheaval of the [[American Revolution]].{{sfn|Bell|2008}} More than any other denomination, the War of Independence internally divided both clergy and laity of the Church of England in America, and opinions covered a wide spectrum of political views: [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]], conciliators, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalists]]. While many Patriots were suspicious of Loyalism in the church, about three-quarters of the signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] were nominally Anglican laymen, including [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[William Paca]], and [[George Wythe]].{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} It was often assumed that persons considered "[[High Church]]" were Loyalists, whereas persons considered "[[Low Church]]" were Patriots: assumptions with possibly dangerous implications for the time.

[[File:Old North Church Boston DSC 0816 ad.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Old North Church]] in [[Boston]]. Inspired by the work of [[Christopher Wren]], it was completed in 1723.]]
Of the approximately three hundred clergy in the Church of England in America between 1776 and 1783, over 80 percent in New England, New York, and New Jersey were loyalists. This is in contrast to the less than 23 percent loyalist clergy in the four southern colonies.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} Many Church of England clergy remained loyalists as they took their two ordination oaths very seriously. Anglican clergy were obliged to swear allegiance to the king as well as to pray for the king, the royal family, and the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]].{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} In general, loyalist clergy stayed by their oaths and prayed for the king or else suspended services.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} By the end of 1776, some Anglican churches were closing.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} Anglican priests held services in private homes or lay readers who were not bound by the oaths held morning and evening prayer.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} During 1775 and 1776, the Continental Congress had issued decrees ordering churches to fast and pray on behalf of the patriots.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} Starting July 4, 1776, Congress and several states passed laws making prayers for the king and British Parliament acts of treason.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} The patriot clergy in the South were quick to find reasons to transfer their oaths to the American cause and prayed for the success of the Revolution.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} One precedent was the transfer of oaths during the [[Glorious Revolution]] in England.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} Most of the patriot clergy in the South were able to keep their churches open and services continued.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}}

===Early Republic era===
In the wake of the Revolution, American Episcopalians faced the task of preserving a hierarchical church structure in a society infused with [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]].

[[File:Old Swedes 2 NJ.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Trinity Church (Swedesboro, New Jersey)|Trinity Church]] in [[Swedesboro, New Jersey]]. Originally serving a [[Church of Sweden]] congregation, it became an Episcopal church in 1786, when this building was completed.]]
When the clergy of [[Connecticut]] elected [[Samuel Seabury (1729–1796)|Samuel Seabury]] as their bishop in 1783, he sought [[consecration]] in England. The [[Oath of Supremacy]] prevented Seabury's consecration in England, so he went to Scotland; the [[Nonjuring schism|non-juring]] bishops of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] consecrated him in [[Aberdeen]] on November 14, 1784, making him, in the words of scholar Arthur Carl Piepkorn, "the first Anglican bishop appointed to minister outside the British Isles".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeandwork.org/features/looking-back-first-overseas-bishop|title=Looking Back: First Overseas Bishop - Life and Work|website=www.lifeandwork.org}}</ref>{{sfn|Piepkorn|1977|p=199}} On August 3, 1785, the first ordinations on American soil took place at Christ Church in [[Middletown, Connecticut]].

By 1786, the church had succeeded in translating episcopacy to America and in revising the ''Book of Common Prayer'' to reflect American political realities. Later, through the efforts of Bishop [[Philander Chase]] (1775–1852) of Ohio, Americans successfully sought material assistance from England for the purpose of training Episcopal clergy. The development of the Protestant Episcopal Church provides an example of how Americans in the early republic maintained important cultural ties with England.{{sfn|Clark|1994}}

In 1787, two priests – [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]] of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Samuel Provoost]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] – were consecrated as bishops by the [[archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[archbishop of York]], and the [[bishop of Bath and Wells]], the legal obstacles having been removed by the passage through Parliament of the Consecration of Bishops Abroad Act 1786. Thus there are two branches of [[historical episcopate|Apostolic succession]] for the American bishops: through the non-juring bishops of Scotland who consecrated Samuel Seabury and through the English church who consecrated William White and Samuel Provoost. All bishops in the American Church are ordained by at least three bishops. One can trace the succession of each back to Seabury, White and Provoost. (''See [[Succession of Bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States|Succession of Bishops of the Episcopal Church]].'')

In 1789, {{When|date=March 2017}}<!-- Doesn't anyone know the actual date? --> representative clergy from [[List of Original Dioceses of ECUSA|nine dioceses]] met in Philadelphia to ratify the church's initial constitution. The Episcopal Church was formally separated from the Church of England in 1789 so that clergy would not be required to accept the supremacy of the British monarch. A revised version of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' was written for the new church that same year. The fourth bishop of the Episcopal Church was [[James Madison (Episcopal bishop)|James Madison]], the first bishop of Virginia. Madison was consecrated in 1790 by the Archbishop of Canterbury and two other Church of England bishops. This third American bishop consecrated within the English line of succession occurred because of continuing unease within the Church of England over Seabury's [[Nonjuring schism|non-juring]] Scottish orders.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004}} The Episcopal Church thus became the first Anglican Province outside the [[British Isles]].<ref name="ABC">{{cite book|author=The Archbishops' Group on the Episcopate|title=Episcopal Ministry: The Report of the Archbishops' Group on the Episcopate, 1990|year=1990|publisher=Church House Publishing|isbn=0-7151-3736-0|page=123}}</ref>

On 17 September 1792, at the triennial general convention ([[synod]]) of the Episcopal Church at [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] on [[Wall Street]], in [[New York City]], [[Thomas John Claggett]] was elected the first bishop of Maryland. He was the first bishop of the Episcopal Church ordained and consecrated in America and the [[Succession of Bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States|fifth Bishop]] consecrated for the Episcopal Church in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=A history of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington|url=http://www.edow.org/about/the-diocese/about-the-diocese/history|work=History of the Diocese|publisher=Episcopal Diocese of Washington|access-date=26 December 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204174152/http://www.edow.org/about/the-diocese/about-the-diocese/history|archive-date=4 February 2012}}</ref>

===Nineteenth century===
[[File:St. John's Episcopal Church.JPG|thumb|[[St. John's Episcopal Church, Lafayette Square (Washington, D.C.)|St. John's Episcopal Church]], built in 1816 in [[Washington, D.C.]], is known as the "Church of the Presidents" for the many presidents who have worshiped there.]]

In 1856 the first society for African Americans in the Episcopal Church was founded by [[James Theodore Holly]]. Named ''The Protestant Episcopal Society for Promoting The Extension of The Church Among Colored People'', the society argued that blacks should be allowed to participate in seminaries and diocesan conventions. The group lost its focus when Holly emigrated to Haiti, but other groups followed after the Civil War. The current [[Union of Black Episcopalians]] traces its history to the society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ube.org/Who%20We%20Are/ube-history.html|title=UBE History|work=The Union of Black Episcopalians – National|publisher=The Union of Black Episcopalians|access-date=2012-07-17}}</ref> Holly went on to found the [[Episcopal Diocese of Haiti|Anglican Church in Haiti]], where he became the first African-American bishop on November 8, 1874. As Bishop of Haiti, Holly was the first African American to attend the [[Lambeth Conference]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/5888_58502_ENG_HTM.htm|title=UBE History|publisher=Episcopalchurch.org|access-date=2008-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710083139/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/5888_58502_ENG_HTM.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archive-date=2008-07-10}}</ref> However, he was consecrated by the American Church Missionary Society, an Evangelical Episcopal branch of the Church.

Episcopal missions chartered by African-Americans in this era were chartered as a [[Colored Episcopal Mission]]. All other missions (white) were chartered as an Organized Episcopal Mission. Many historically Black parishes are still in existence to date.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.episcopalarchives.org/Afro-Anglican_history/exhibit/legacy/black_parishes.php|title=The Church Awakens: African Americans and the Struggle for Justice {{!}} Historical African American Parishes|website=www.episcopalarchives.org|access-date=2017-08-01}}</ref>

[[File:St. John's Episcopal Montgomery Feb 2012 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[St. John's Episcopal Church (Montgomery, Alabama)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], established in 1834. The church building was completed in 1855. The Secession Convention of Southern Churches was held here in 1861.]]
When the [[American Civil War]] began in 1861, Episcopalians in the South formed the [[Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America]]. However, in the North the separation was never officially recognized. By May 16, 1866, the southern dioceses had rejoined the national church.{{sfn|Mason|1990}}

By the middle of the 19th century, [[Evangelical Anglicanism|evangelical Episcopalians]] disturbed by [[High Church]] [[Tractarianism]], while continuing to work in interdenominational agencies, formed their own voluntary societies, and eventually, in 1874, a faction objecting to the revival of ritual practices established the [[Reformed Episcopal Church]].{{sfn|Butler|1995}}

[[Samuel David Ferguson]] was the first black bishop consecrated by the Episcopal Church, the first to practice in the U.S. and the first black person to sit in the [[House of Bishops]]. Bishop Ferguson was consecrated on June 24, 1885, with the then-Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church acting as a consecrator.

During the [[Gilded Age]], highly prominent laity such as banker [[J. P. Morgan]], industrialist [[Henry Ford]], and art collector [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]] played a central role in shaping a distinctive upper class Episcopalian ethos, especially with regard to preserving the arts and history. These philanthropists propelled the Episcopal Church into a quasi-national position of importance while at the same time giving the church a central role in the cultural transformation of the country.{{sfn|Williams|2006}} Another mark of influence is the fact that more than a quarter of all [[President of the United States|presidents of the United States]] have been Episcopalians (see [[religious affiliations of Presidents of the United States]]). It was during this period that the ''Book of Common Prayer'' was revised, first in 1892 and later in 1928.

At the 1958 general convention, a coalition of [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] church members succeeded in passing a resolution recognizing "the natural dignity and value of every man, of whatever color or race, as created in the image of God". It called on Episcopalians "to work together, in charity and forbearance, towards the establishment ... of full opportunities in fields such as education, housing, employment and public accommodations". In response, the Episcopal Society for Cultural and Racial Unity (ESCRU) was founded in December 1959 in order to eliminate racial, ethnic and class barriers within the Episcopal Church. Opposition from southern church leaders prevented the Episcopal Church from taking a strong stand on civil rights prior to 1963. One prominent opponent of the movement was [[Charles Carpenter (bishop)|Charles C.J. Carpenter]], the Bishop of Alabama.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004|p=134}} By 1963, many church leaders felt more comfortable speaking out in support of racial equality. That year, Presiding Bishop [[Arthur C. Lichtenberger|Arthur Lichtenberger]] wrote a pastoral letter urging Christians to work "across lines of racial separation, in a common struggle for justice", and the House of Bishops endorsed civil rights legislation.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004|p=135}}

In 1967, Lichtenberger's successor, [[John E. Hines|John Hines]] led the Episcopal Church to implement the General Convention Special Program (GCSP). The program was designed to redirect nine million dollars over a three-year period (a quarter of the church's operating budget at the time) to fund special grants for community organizations and grassroots efforts facilitating black empowerment in America's urban ghettos.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004|p=136}} The effectiveness of the GCSP was limited due to the reluctance of conservative bishops in southern dioceses, who objected to the awarding of grants to groups perceived as radical. The GCSP also drew opposition from the recently formed Foundation for Christian Theology, a conservative organization opposed to "involv[ing] the Church in the social, political, and economic activities of our times". The tension between liberal and conservative constituencies in the church erupted during the Special General Convention of 1969. The convention was disrupted by black militants who demanded that the Episcopal Church hear their concerns. When white deputies objected to allowing the militants a hearing, African-American deputies walked out of the convention. The Special General Convention also witnessed protests of the Vietnam War. During this time period, African-American clergy organized the [[Union of Black Episcopalians]] to achieve full inclusion of African Americans at all levels of the Episcopal Church. {{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004|p=137-8}}

The liberal policies of Presiding Bishop Hines and the general conventions of 1967 and 1969 led to a conservative reaction. Facing declining membership and a one million dollar budget cut, the Special Program became an easy target for conservatives, who succeeded in drastically reducing the financial support for the program in 1970. It was finally ended in 1973 with little protest. A year later, Hines was succeeded by [[John Allin|John M. Allin]], the Bishop of Mississippi and a conservative.{{sfn|Hein|Shattuck|2004|p=138}}

===Recent history===
In recent decades, the Episcopal Church, like other [[Mainline Protestant|mainline]] churches, has experienced a decline in membership as well as internal controversy over [[Ordination of women#Anglican|women's ordination]] and the [[Homosexuality and Anglicanism|place of homosexuals in the church]]. The 1976 General Convention also passed a resolution calling for an end to [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]] and in 1985 called for "dioceses, institutions, and agencies" to create [[equal opportunity employment]] and [[affirmative action]] policies to address any potential "racial inequities" in clergy placement. Because of these and other controversial issues including abortion, individual members and clergy can and do frequently disagree with the stated position of the church's leadership.  In January 2016, the Anglican Primates Meeting at Canterbury decided that in response to the "distance" caused by what it called "unilateral action on matters of doctrine without catholic unity", "for a period of three years, The Episcopal Church [would neither] represent [the Communion] on ecumenical and interfaith bodies… [nor] take part in decision making on any issues pertaining to doctrine or [[Ecclesiastical Polity|polity]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2016/01/statement-from-primates-2016.aspx|title=Statement from Primates 2016}}</ref>

====Revised prayer book====
In 1976, the General Convention adopted a new prayer book, which was a substantial revision and modernization of the previous 1928 edition. It incorporated many principles of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]'s [[liturgical movement]], which had been discussed at [[Vatican II]]. This version was adopted as the official prayer book in 1979 after an initial three-year trial use. Several conservative parishes, however, continued to use the 1928 version.  In 2018, the General Convention authorized a Task Force for Liturgical and Prayer Book Revision to consider further revisions, particularly to use more inclusive language and to give more attention to the stewardship of creation.<ref>https://www.episcopalcommonprayer.org/</ref>

====Ordination of women====

On July 29, 1974, a group of women known as the [[Philadelphia Eleven]] were irregularly ordained as priests in the Episcopal Church by bishops Daniel Corrigan, Robert L. DeWitt, and Edward R. Welles, assisted by [[Jose Antonio Ramos|Antonio Ramos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/41685_3311_ENG_HTM.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019161924/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/41685_3311_ENG_HTM.htm|archive-date=2010-10-19|title=Episcopal Church Women's Ministries: The Philadelphia 11|publisher=Episcopalchurch.org|access-date=2008-11-16}}</ref> On September 7, 1975, four more women (the "[[Washington Four]]") were irregularly ordained by retired bishop [[George W. Barrett (bishop)|George W. Barrett]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/41685_3410_ENG_HTM.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114165306/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/41685_3410_ENG_HTM.htm|archive-date=2011-01-14|title=Episcopal Church Women's Ministries: The Washington 4|publisher=Episcopalchurch.org|access-date=2008-11-16}}</ref> In the wake of the controversy over the ordination of the Philadelphia Eleven, the General Convention permitted the ordination of women in 1976 and recognized the ordinations of the 15 forerunners. The first women were canonically ordained to the priesthood in 1977. The first woman to become a bishop, [[Barbara Clementine Harris|Barbara Harris]], was consecrated on February 11, 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/5888_3916_ENG_HTM.htm |title=Office of Black Ministries |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date=2009-08-08 |access-date=2014-07-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808162703/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/5888_3916_ENG_HTM.htm |archive-date=August 8, 2009 }}</ref>

At the same time, there was still tolerance for those dioceses who opposed women's ordination. In 1994, the General Convention affirmed that there was value in the theological position that women should not be ordained. In 1997, however, the General Convention then determined that "the canons regarding the ordination, licensing, and deployment of women are mandatory" and required noncompliant dioceses to issue status reports on their progress towards full compliance.<ref name="1997-A053">The Archives of the Episcopal Church, [http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution.pl?resolution=1997-A053 Acts of Convention: Resolution #1997-A053, Implement Mandatory Rights of Women Clergy under Canon Law]. Retrieved 2008-10-31.</ref>

In 2006, the General Convention elected [[Katharine Jefferts Schori]] as [[Presiding bishop#The Episcopal Church|Presiding Bishop]]. She is the first and, currently, the only woman to become a [[primate (bishop)|primate]] in the Anglican Communion. Schori's election was controversial in the wider Anglican Communion because not all of the communion recognizes the ordination of women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/3577_77919_ENG_HTM.htm|title=Episcopal Diocese of Quincy seeks alternative oversight|publisher=Episcopalchurch.org|date=September 19, 2006|access-date=2008-11-16|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112061319/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/3577_77919_ENG_HTM.htm|archive-date=November 12, 2008}}</ref>

At the time of the formation of the [[Anglican Church in North America]] (ACNA), three U.S. dioceses did not ordain women as priests or bishops: [[Episcopal Diocese of San Joaquin|San Joaquin]], [[Episcopal Diocese of Quincy|Quincy]], and [[Episcopal Diocese of Fort Worth (Episcopal Church)|Fort Worth]].  Following the departures of their conservative majorities, all three dioceses now ordain women. With the October 16, 2010, ordination of Margaret Lee, in the Peoria-based Diocese of Quincy, Illinois, women have been ordained as priests in all 110 dioceses of the Episcopal Church in the United States.<ref name="lastepiscopol">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/20/last-holdout-episcopal-di_n_770510.html |title=Last Episcopal Holdout Ordains Female Priest |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |access-date=2014-08-12}}</ref>

====Affirmation of LGBT people====
The Episcopal Church affirmed at the 1976 [[General Convention]] that [[homosexuals]] are "children of God" who deserve acceptance and [[pastoral care]] from the church and [[equal protection]] under the law. The first openly [[gay]] person ordained as a priest was [[Ellen Barrett]] in 1977.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5D9173FF934A25751C1A96F948260&scp=17&sq=Ellen%20Barrett&st=cse|title=Openly Gay Priest Ordained in Jersey|work=The New York Times|first=Mireya|last=Navarro|date=1989-12-17}}</ref> Despite such an affirmation of [[Gay rights in the US|gay rights]], the General Convention affirmed in 1991 that "physical sexual expression" is only appropriate within the [[monogamous]] lifelong "union of husband and wife".<ref name="1991-A104">{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution.pl?resolution=1991-A104 |title=Acts of Convention: Resolution # 1991-A104 |publisher=Episcopalarchives.org |access-date=2014-07-26}}</ref>

[[File:GeneRobinson.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gene Robinson in 2013]]
The church elected its first openly gay bishop, [[Gene Robinson]], in June 2003.{{sfn|Adams|2006}} News of Robinson's election caused a crisis in both the American church and the wider [[Anglican Communion]]. In October 2003, Anglican primates (the heads of the Anglican Communion's 38 member churches) convened an emergency meeting. The meeting's final communiqué included the warning that if Robinson's consecration proceeded, it would "tear the fabric of the communion at its deepest level".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/articles/36/25/acns3633.html|title=ANGLICAN COMMUNION NEWS SERVICE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031103051256/http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/articles/36/25/acns3633.html|archive-date=November 3, 2003}}</ref> The news of his ordination caused such an outrage that during the ceremony, at which his long-time partner was present, Robinson was forced to wear a [[bullet-proof]] vest beneath his [[vestments]], and he also received numerous death threats following his installation as bishop of the [[Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire]].

In 2009, the General Convention charged the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music to develop theological and liturgical resources for same-sex blessings and report back to the General Convention in 2012. It also gave bishops an option to provide "generous pastoral support", especially where civil authorities have legalized same-gender marriage, civil unions, or domestic partnerships.<ref name="2009-C056">{{cite web|url=http://38.149.19.55/ViewLegislation/view_leg_detail.aspx?id=898&type=Final|title=Resolution C056: Liturgies for Blessings|website=76th General Convention Legislation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424190216/http://38.149.19.55/ViewLegislation/view_leg_detail.aspx?id=898&type=Final|archive-date=April 24, 2012}}</ref>

On July 14, 2009, the Episcopal Church's House of Bishops voted that "any ordained ministry" is open to gay men and [[lesbians]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the move was "likely to send shockwaves through the Anglican Communion". This vote ended a moratorium on ordaining gay bishops passed in 2006 and passed in spite of Archbishop [[Rowan Williams]]'s personal call at the start of the convention that, "I hope and pray that there won't be decisions in the coming days that will push us further apart."<ref name="NYT20090715">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/us/15episcopal.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Episcopal Vote Reopens a Door to Gay Bishops|first=Laurie|last=Goodstein|date=2009-07-15|access-date=2010-05-02}}</ref>

On July 10, 2012, the Episcopal Church approved an official liturgy for the blessing of same-sex relationships. This liturgy was not a marriage rite, but the blessing included an exchange of vows and the couple's agreement to enter into a lifelong committed relationship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/10/episcopal-church-gay-couples-same-sex-blessings_n_1663291.html|title=Episcopal Church Approves Gay Couples' Same-Sex Blessings|publisher=Huffington Post|date=10 July 2012|access-date=19 May 2016}}</ref>

On June 29, 2015, at the 78th General Convention of the Episcopal Church, a resolution removing the definition of marriage as being between one man and one woman was passed by the House of Bishops with 129 in favor, 26 against, and 5 abstaining.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/2188/0/welby-voices-deep-concern-over-us-anglicans-gay-marriage-liturgy|title=The Tablet - News|work=thetablet.co.uk}}</ref> The current archbishop of Canterbury, [[Justin Welby]], expressed "deep concern" over the ruling.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/anglican-head-expresses-concern-about-episcopal-vote-on-gay-marriage/2015/07/02/61dcc656-20e8-11e5-a135-935065bc30d0_story.html |title=Anglican Head Expresses Concern About Episcopal Vote on Gay Marriage |last=Grundy |first=Trevor |date=2 July 2015 |work=Washington Post |access-date=19 January 2016}}</ref> In 2016, Anglican leaders temporarily suspended the Episcopal Church from key positions in their global fellowship in response to the church changing its canons on marriage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/anglicans-sanction-us-episcopal-church-gay-marriage-36293320|title=Health Index|first=ABC|last=News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premier.org.uk/News/UK/PRIMATES-MEETING-OUTCOME-Episcopal-Church-suspended-from-full-participation-in-Anglican-Communion|title=PRIMATES MEETING OUTCOME: Episcopal Church suspended from full participation in Anglican Communion - Premier|last=Premier|date=1 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=McGowan |first=Andrew |title=No, the Episcopal Church has not been suspended from the Anglican Communion | website=Saint Ronan Street Diary | url=http://abmcg.blogspot.com/2016/01/no-episcopal-church-has-not-been.html}}</ref>

==== Separations from the church ====
[[File:ECUSA South Carolina.png|thumb|Many members and parishes of the historic [[Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina (before 2012)|Diocese of South Carolina]] left the Episcopal Church in 2012, eventually becoming a diocese of the [[Anglican Church in North America]]]]
Following the ordination of Bp.

The Episcopal Church did not acknowledge any of the purported diocesan withdrawals, stating that under [[canon law]] an Episcopal diocese cannot withdraw itself from the larger Episcopal Church. In a "pastoral letter" to the South Carolina diocese, Presiding Bishop Schori wrote that "While some leaders have expressed a desire to leave The Episcopal Church, the Diocese has not left. It cannot, by its own action. The alteration, dissolution, or departure of a diocese of The Episcopal Church requires the consent of General Convention, which has not been consulted."<ref name=pastlet>Episcopal News Service (November 15, 2012).

If it becomes fully evident that those former leaders have, indeed, fully severed their ties with The Episcopal Church, new leaders will be elected and installed by action of a Diocesan Convention recognized by the wider Episcopal Church, in accordance with our Constitution and Canons."

Many departing members joined the [[Continuing Anglican movement]] or advocated [[Anglican realignment]], claiming alignment with overseas Anglican provinces including the [[Anglican Province of the Southern Cone of America]] and the [[Church of Nigeria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diosc.com/sys/index.php?view=article&catid=1%3Alatest-news&id=452%3Athe-episcopal-church-takes-action-against-the-diocese-of-south-carolina-special-convetion-called&format=pdf&option=com_content&Itemid=75/|title=Episcopal Church Takes Action Against the Bishop and Diocese of SC|author=Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina|access-date=2013-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029095941/http://www.diosc.com/sys/index.php?view=article&catid=1%3Alatest-news&id=452%3Athe-episcopal-church-takes-action-against-the-diocese-of-south-carolina-special-convetion-called&format=pdf&option=com_content&Itemid=75%2F|archive-date=October 29, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Some former members formed the [[Anglican Church in North America]] which, as of 2017, claimed over 1,000 congregations and 134,000 members.<ref name=churchfinder>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicanchurch.net/?/main/locator/us |title=Anglican Church in North America |publisher=Anglicanchurch.net |access-date=2014-07-26}}</ref> Episcopal Church leaders, particularly former Presiding Bishop [[Katharine Jefferts Schori]], responded by taking a firm stance against the separatists.

====Church property disputes====
In a letter to the House of Bishops during summer 2009, Presiding Bishop [[Katharine Jefferts Schori]] instructed local dioceses not to sell parish property to departing groups. She stated: "We do not make settlements that encourage religious bodies who seek to replace The Episcopal Church".<ref name=schoriletter>{{cite web|last=Harmon |first=Kendall |url=http://kendallharmon.net/2009/08/the_presiding_bishop_writes_the_house_of_bishops/ |title=TitusOneNine - The Presiding Bishop Writes the House of Bishops |publisher=Kendallharmon.net |date=2009-08-03 |access-date=2014-02-04}}</ref>

Before Schori took this stand, prior bishops had treated parish property disputes as internal diocesan matters that are "not subject to the review or oversight of the presiding bishop". One example was when then-Presiding Bishop Frank Griswold told the Diocese of Western Louisiana on May 11, 2006, that the national church involved itself in parish property disputes only upon invitation of the local bishop and diocesan standing committees.<ref>{{cite news |title=Presiding Bishop steps in to prevent church sales |first=George |last=Conger |url=http://geoconger.wordpress.com/2009/08/13/presiding-bishop-steps-in-to-prevent-church-sales-cen-8-11-09/ |newspaper=Church of England Newspaper |date=2009-08-07| page=7 |access-date=24 November 2012}}</ref> Schori's letter stated that her firm stance was the consensus of the Council of Advice and expressed hope that "those who have departed can gain clarity about their own identity".<ref name=schoriletter />

After the South Carolina diocese voted to withdraw, it sued the national Episcopal Church to retain control over its property. The departing diocese initially won, but mostly lost on appeal to the South Carolina Supreme Court. Seven parishes affiliated with the departing group were allowed to keep their property.

==Structure==
The Episcopal Church is governed according to [[episcopal polity]] with its own system of [[Canon law (Episcopal Church in the United States)|canon law]]. This means that the church is organized into [[dioceses]] led by [[bishop]]s in consultation with representative bodies. It is a [[Unitary state|unitary body]], in that the power of the [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] is not limited by the individual dioceses. The church has, however, a highly decentralized structure and characteristics of a [[confederation]].{{sfn|Podmore|2008|p=130}}

===Parishes and dioceses===
{{Further|Dioceses of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America}}
At the local level, there are 6,447 Episcopal congregations, each of which elects a [[vestry]] or bishop's committee. Subject to the approval of its [[diocesan bishop]], the vestry of each [[parish]] elects a [[priest]], called the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], who has spiritual jurisdiction in the parish and selects assistant clergy, both [[deacon]]s and priests. (There is a difference between vestry and clergy elections – clergy are ordained members usually selected from outside the parish, whereas any member in good standing of a parish is eligible to serve on the vestry.) The diocesan bishop, however, appoints the clergy for all missions and may choose to do so for non-self-supporting parishes.

The [[middle judicatory]] consists of a diocese headed by a bishop who is assisted by a standing committee.<ref name="09ConstArtIV">{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalarchives.org/pdf/CnC/CandC_2009pp123-166.pdf|title=Governance Documents of the Church - The Archives of the Episcopal Church}}</ref> The bishop and standing committee are elected by the diocesan convention whose members are selected by the congregations.

There are 110 dioceses in the United States, [[Colombia]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[Haiti]], [[Honduras]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Taiwan]], [[Venezuela]] and the [[Virgin Islands]].

===Episcopal Church governance===
{{Main|General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America}}The [[Washington National Cathedral]] is the [[Cathedra|seat]] of the [[Presiding Bishop#Episcopal Church in the USA|Presiding Bishop]] of the Episcopal Church as well as the bishop of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Washington]].[[File:DCA 08 2009 National Cathedral 6981.JPG|thumb|The Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the City and Diocese of Washington, located in [[Washington, D.C.]], is operated under the more familiar name of [[Washington National Cathedral]].]]

The highest legislative body of the Episcopal Church is the triennial [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]], consisting of the [[House of Deputies]] and the [[House of Bishops]]. All active (whether [[diocesan bishop|diocesan]], [[Coadjutor Bishop|coadjutor]], [[suffragan bishop|suffragan]], or [[Assistant Bishop|assistant]]) and retired bishops make up the over 300 members of the House of Bishops. Diocesan conventions elect over 800 representatives (each diocese elects four laity and four clergy) to the House of Deputies. The House of Deputies elects a president and vice-president to preside at meetings. General Convention enacts two types of legislation. The first type is the rules by which the church is governed as contained in the Constitution and [[canon law|Canons]]; the second type are broad guidelines on church policy called resolutions.{{sfn|Swatos|2005|p=212}} Either house may propose legislation.<ref name="09ConstArtI">{{Cite web |url=http://www.episcopalarchives.org/pdf/CnC/CandC_2009pp11-60.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 4, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608091222/http://www.episcopalarchives.org/pdf/CnC/CandC_2009pp11-60.pdf |archive-date=June 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The House of Deputies only meets as a full body once every three years; however, the House of Bishops meets regularly throughout the triennium between conventions.

The real work of General Convention is done by interim bodies, the most powerful being the Executive Council, which oversees the work of the national church during the triennium. The council has 40 members; 20 are directly elected by the General Convention, 18 are elected by the nine provinces, and the Presiding Bishop and President of the House of Deputies are ''[[ex officio]]'' members.<ref name="09ConstArtI"/> Other interim bodies include a number of standing commissions which study and draft policy proposals for consideration and report back to General Convention.

Worship according to the [[Book of Common Prayer]] (BCP) is central to the Episcopal Church's identity and its main source of unity. The current edition of the BCP was published in 1979 and is similar to other Anglican prayer books in use around the world. It contains most of the worship services (or [[liturgy|liturgies]]) used in the Episcopal Church.{{Sfn|Webber|1999|pp=28–31}}

The Episcopal Church has a sacramental understanding of worship. The Episcopal [[catechism]] defines a [[sacrament]] as "an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace given to us".{{Sfn|Webber|1999|pp=34}} Episcopalians believe that sacraments are material things that God uses to act in human lives.{{Sfn|Webber|1999|pp=34}} The BCP identifies [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] as the "two great sacraments of the Gospel". [[Confirmation]], [[ordination]], [[Christian views on marriage|holy matrimony]], [[reconciliation of a penitent]], and [[Anointing of the sick|unction]] are identified as "sacramental rites".{{Sfn|Webber|1999|pp=37}} [[Confession (religion)#Anglicanism|Private confession]] of sin is available in the Episcopal Church, though it is not as commonly practiced as in the Roman Catholic Church. This is in part due to the [[Act of Contrition#Anglican Communion|general confession]] provided for in Episcopal services.{{Sfn|Webber|1999|pp=37}}

The prayer book specifies that the Eucharist or Holy Communion is "the principal act of Christian worship on the Lord's Day".{{Sfn|Webber|1999|p=28}} The service has two parts. The first is centered on [[Bible]] readings and preaching. At each service, four scripture passages are read from the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]]. The readings are organized in a three-year cycle during which much of the Bible will have been read in church.{{Sfn|Webber|1999|pp=44}} The second part of the service is centered on the Eucharist. The Episcopal Church teaches the [[real presence]] doctrine—that the bread and wine truly become the [[Body of Christ|body]] and [[blood of Christ]]. However, it does not define how this happens, which allows for different views to coexist within the church.{{Sfn|Webber|1999|pp=31–33}} Generally, Episcopal churches have retained features such as the altar rail, the inclusion or exclusion of which does not elicit much controversy, but usually celebrate in the ''[[versus populum]]'' orientation.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

[[File:High altar at St. Mary's Episcopal Church..JPG|thumb|High altar of an Anglo-Catholic church ''[[ad orientem]]'' style]]

Often a congregation or a particular service will be referred to as ''Low Church'' or ''High Church''. In theory:
* [[High Church]], especially the ''very'' high [[Anglo-Catholic]] movement, is ritually inclined towards the use of incense, formal hymns, and a higher degree of ceremony such as ''[[ad orientem]]'' in relation to the priest and altar. In addition to clergy vesting in [[alb]]s, [[stole (vestment)|stoles]], and [[chasuble]]s, the lay assistants may also be vested in [[cassock]] and [[surplice]]. The sung Eucharist tends to be emphasized in High Church congregations, with Anglo-Catholic congregations and celebrants using sung services almost exclusively. [[Marian devotion]] is sometimes seen in the Anglo-Catholic and some High Church parishes. 
* [[Low Church]] is simpler and may incorporate other elements such as informal praise and worship music. "Low" parishes tend towards a more "traditional Protestant" outlook with its emphasis of Biblical revelation over symbolism. A few "low" parishes even subscribe to traditional [[Evangelical]] theology (see [[Evangelical Anglicanism]]). The spoken Eucharist tends to be emphasized in Low Church congregations. [[Altar rails]] may be omitted in this type.
* [[Broad Church]] indicates a middle ground. These parishes are the most common within The Episcopal Church. However, unlike the Anglican Church in England, most Episcopal "broad church" parishes make use of a liturgy that includes eucharistic vestments, chant, and a high view of the sacraments, even if the liturgy is not as solemn or lacks some of the other accoutrements typical of Anglo-Catholic parishes. Unlike many Roman Catholic churches, the altar rail has usually been retained and communion is usually served kneeling at the altar rail similar to a [[Tridentine Mass]], because the Episcopal Church teaches, through its Book of Common Prayer, a theologically high view of the church and its sacraments, even if not all parishes carry this out liturgically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gracechurchinnewark.org/how-the-episcopal-church-teaches.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514143119/http://www.gracechurchinnewark.org/how-the-episcopal-church-teaches.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-05-14 |title=Grace Church in Newark}} </ref>

The Book of Common Prayer also provides the [[Daily Office (Anglican)|Daily Offices]] of Morning and Evening Prayer. The daily offices can be said by lay people at home.{{Sfn|Webber|1999|pp=37–38}}

The veneration of [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church)|saints in the Episcopal Church]] is a continuation of an ancient tradition from the early church which honors important people of the Christian faith. The usage of the term "saint" is similar to Roman Catholic and Orthodox traditions. There are explicit references in the 1979 Book of Common Prayer to invoking the aid of the prophets, patriarchs, saints, martyrs and the Virgin Mary as in an optional prayer in the committal at a funeral, p.&nbsp;504. In general Anglicans pray with the saints in their fellowship, not to them, although their intercessions may be requested. Those inclined to the Anglo-Catholic traditions may explicitly invoke saints as intercessors in prayer.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

The 1979 edition contains a provision for the use of "traditional" (Elizabethan) language under various circumstances not directly provided for in the book, and the [[Anglican Service Book]] was produced accordingly, as "a traditional language adaptation of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer together with the Psalter or Psalms of David and Additional Devotions".{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

The center of Episcopal teaching is the life and resurrection of [[Jesus Christ]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/visitors_16966_ENG_HTM.htm?menupage=43796|title=A Basic Introduction to Christianity|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818035446/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/visitors_16966_ENG_HTM.htm?menupage=43796|archive-date=August 18, 2010}}</ref> The Doctrine of the Episcopal Church is found in the Canon of Holy Scripture as understood in the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds and in the sacramental rites, the Ordinal and Catechism of the Book of Common Prayer.<ref>{{cite book |last1=The Archives of the Episcopal Church |title=Constitution and Canons |pages=132–133 |url=https://www.episcopalarchives.org/sites/default/files/publications/2015_CandC.pdf |access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref> Some of these teachings include:
* Jesus Christ is [[Hypostatic union|fully human and fully God]]. He died and was resurrected from the dead.
* Jesus provides the way of eternal life for those who believe.
* God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit, are one God, and are called the Holy Trinity ("three and yet one").
* The Old and New Testaments of the Bible were written by people "under the [[Biblical inspiration|inspiration of the Holy Spirit]]". The Apocrypha are additional books that are used in Christian worship, but not for the formation of doctrine.
* The two great and necessary [[Anglican sacraments|sacraments]] are [[Baptism|Holy Baptism]] and [[Eucharist|Holy Eucharist]].
* Other sacramental rites are [[confirmation]], [[ordination]], [[marriage]], [[Confession (religion)|reconciliation of a penitent]], and [[unction]].
* Belief in [[heaven]], [[hell]], and [[Second Coming|Jesus' return in glory]].
* Emphasis on living out the [[Great Commandment]] to love God and neighbor fully.<ref>Joseph Buchanan Bernardin, ''An Introduction to the Episcopal Church'' (2008) p. 63</ref>

The full catechism is included in the Book of Common Prayer and is posted on the Episcopal website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/visitors_10898_ENG_HTM.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611232640/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/visitors_10898_ENG_HTM.htm|archive-date=2011-06-11|title=Visitors' Center|publisher=Episcopalchurch.org|access-date=2008-11-16}}</ref> In practice, not all Episcopalians hold all of these beliefs, but ordained clergy are required to "solemnly engage to conform" to this doctrine.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Book of Common Prayer |publisher=Church Publishing, Inc. |location=New York |page=513}}</ref>

The Episcopal Church follows the ''[[via media]]'' or "middle way" between [[Protestant]] and Roman Catholic doctrine and practices: that is both Catholic and Reformed. Although many Episcopalians identify with this concept, those whose convictions lean toward either [[evangelical Anglicanism]] or [[Anglo-Catholicism]] may not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/visitors_8950_ENG_HTM.htm|title=What makes us Anglican? Hallmarks of the Episcopal Church|publisher=Episcopalchurch.org|access-date=2008-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612013931/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/visitors_8950_ENG_HTM.htm|archive-date=2011-06-12}}</ref>

A broad spectrum of theological views is represented within the Episcopal Church. Some Episcopal members or theologians hold [[evangelical]] positions, affirming the authority of [[sola scriptura|scripture over all]]. The Episcopal Church website glossary defines the sources of authority as a balance between scripture, tradition, and reason. These three are characterized as a "three-legged stool" which will topple if any one overbalances the other. It also notes<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090904145347/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/19625_13797_ENG_HTM.htm Authority, Sources of (in Anglicanism)] on the Episcopal Church site, accessed on April 19, 2007, which in turn credits Church Publishing Incorporated, New York, NY, from ''An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, A User Friendly Reference for Episcopalians,'' Don S. Armentrout and Robert Boak Slocum, editors.</ref>
{{quote|The Anglican balancing of the sources of authority has been criticized as clumsy or "muddy." It has been associated with the Anglican affinity for seeking the mean between extremes and living the via media. It has also been associated with the Anglican willingness to tolerate and comprehend opposing viewpoints instead of imposing tests of orthodoxy or resorting to heresy trials.}}
This balance of scripture, tradition and reason is traced to the work of [[Richard Hooker]], a 16th-century apologist. In Hooker's model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine and things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080723214242/http://www.anglicanlistening.org/anglican_listening_61766_ENG_HTM.htm Anglican Listening] on the Episcopal Church site goes into detail on how scripture, tradition, and reason work to "uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way".</ref> Noting the role of personal experience in Christian life, some Episcopalians have advocated following the example of the [[Wesleyan Quadrilateral]] of [[Methodist]] theology by thinking in terms of a "Fourth Leg" of "experience". This understanding is highly dependent on the work of [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Friedrich Schleiermacher]].

A public example of this struggle between different Christian positions in the church has been the 2003 consecration of [[Gene Robinson]], an openly gay man living with a long-term partner. The acceptance/rejection of his consecration is motivated by different views on the understanding of scripture.<ref>As stated in section 2.16 of [https://web.archive.org/web/20050623174848/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/documents/ToSetOurHopeOnChrist.pdf To Set Our Hope On Christ (PDF)], because "the biblical writers [...] write at different times and in different circumstances, they do not always agree with one another. [...] For example, it is helpful to know that when Ezra (chapter 10) commands the men of Israel to divorce their wives, it is because they had married foreign wives, who are seen to be a danger to Israel in exile. But there is another belief about foreign wives in the Book of Ruth, probably written at about the same time. [...] Today, in some situations, it may be faithful to follow Ezra, while in most situations it is faithful to follow Ruth."</ref> This struggle has some members concerned that the church may not continue its relationship with the larger Anglican Church. Others, however, view this pluralism as an asset, allowing a place for both sides to balance each other.

Comedian and Episcopalian [[Robin Williams]] once described the Episcopal faith (and, in a performance in London, specifically the Church of England) as "Catholic Lite – same rituals, half the guilt".<ref>''Robin Williams: Live on Broadway''</ref>

===Social positions===

====Economic issues====
In 1991, the church's general convention recommended parity in pay and benefits between [[Clergy#Anglicanism|clergy]] and [[Laity#Anglicanism|lay]] employees in equivalent positions.<ref>General Convention [http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=1991-D066 Resolution 1991-D066] Support a Policy of Pay Equity in the Church and Society</ref>

Several times between 1979 and 2003, the convention expressed concern over [[affordable housing]] and supported work to provide affordable housing.<ref>General Convention [http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=2003-D040 Resolution 2003-D040] Reaffirm Commitment to Provide Affordable Housing for the Poor</ref>

In 1982 and 1997, the convention reaffirmed the church's commitment to eradicating [[poverty]] and [[malnutrition]], and challenged parishes to increase ministries to the poor.<ref>General Convention [http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=1997-D030 Resolution 1997-D030] Challenge Congregations to Establish Direct Ministries to the Poor</ref>

The convention urged the church in 1997 and 2000 to promote [[living wage]]s for all.<ref>General Convention [http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=1997-D082 Resolution 1997-D082] Urge Church-wide Promotion of the Living Wage</ref><ref>General Convention [http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=2000-A081 Resolution 2000-A081] Urge Bishops and Diocesan Leaders to Support the National Implementation of a Just Wage</ref>

In 2003, the convention urged U.S. legislators to raise the national [[minimum wage]], and to establish a [[living wage]] with [[Health benefits (insurance)|health benefits]] as the national standard.<ref>General Convention [http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=2003-A130 Resolution 2003-A130] Support the Establishment of a Living Wage</ref><ref>General Convention [http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=2003-C030 Resolution 2003-C030] Urge Legislation to Raise the Federal Minimum Wage</ref>

====Marriage of same-sex couples====
At its 2015 triennial general convention, the church adopted "canonical and liturgical changes to provide marriage equality for Episcopalians". The canonical change eliminated "language defining marriage as between a man and a woman". The "two new marriage rites" contain language that allows "them to be used by same-sex or opposite-sex couples".<ref name="78th General Convention" /> The blessing of same-sex relationships is not uniform throughout the Episcopal Church. Following the 2015 general convention, bishops were able to determine whether churches and priests within their dioceses were permitted to use the new liturgies. Bishops who did not permit their use were to connect same-sex couples to a diocese where the liturgies were allowed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/07/01/why-the-episcopal-church-is-still-debating-gay-marriage/|title=The Episcopal Church approves religious weddings for gay couples after controversial debate|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-12-11}}</ref> However, following the 2018 general convention, resolution B012 was amended to "make provision for all couples asking to be married in this church to have access to these liturgies". This effectively granted all churches and clergy, with or without the support of their bishop, the ability to perform same-sex marriages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/article/some-same-sex-couples-will-still-face-hurdles-accessing-churchs-marriage-rites|title=Some same-sex couples will still face hurdles accessing church’s marriage rites|website=The Episcopal Church|access-date=2018-12-30}}</ref> The church also opposes any state or federal constitutional amendments designed to prohibit the marriages of same-sex couples.<ref name="PewSameSex">[http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/07/religious-groups-official-positions-on-same-sex-marriage/ "Religious Groups' Official Positions on Same-Sex Marriage"].

==== Ordination of LGBT identified individuals ====
Openly gay, lesbian, and transgender individuals are eligible to be ordained. The Episcopal Church has a nondiscrimination policy that prohibits discrimination on the basis of "gender identity and expression".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/15/AR2009071503697.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Episcopalians in Va.

====Racial equality====
In 1861, [[John Henry Hopkins]]' wrote a pamphlet entitled, ''[[A Scriptural, Ecclesiastical, and Historical View of Slavery]]'', attempting to justify slavery from the New Testament: the pamphlet gives a clear insight into the Episcopal Church's involvement in slavery. ''Bishop Hopkins' Letter on Slavery Ripped Up and his Misuse of the Sacred Scriptures Exposed'', written by [[G.W. Hyer]] in 1863, opposed the points mentioned in Hopkins' pamphlet and revealed a startling divide in the Episcopal Church over the issue of slavery.<ref>G.W. Hyer, Bishop Hopkins' Letter on Slavery Ripped up and His Misuse of the Sacred Scriptures Exposed by a Clergyman of the Protestant Episcopal Church (New York: John F. Trow, 1863).</ref> In 1991, the General Convention declared "the practice of racism is sin,"<ref name="GC1991-B051">{{Citation|author=The 70th General Convention of the Episcopal Church|publisher=The Archives of the Episcopal Church|url=http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=1991-B051|work=Acts of Convention|title=Resolution #1991-B051, Call for the Removal of Racism from the Life of the Nation|access-date=2008-10-31}}</ref> and in 2006, a unanimous House of Bishops endorsed Resolution A123 apologizing for complicity in the institution of slavery, and silence over "Jim Crow" laws, segregation, and racial discrimination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingchurch.org/publishertlc/viewarticle.asp?ID=2189|title=Bishops Endorse Apology for Slavery Complicity|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013164059/http://livingchurch.org/publishertlc/viewarticle.asp?ID=2189|archive-date=2007-10-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2018, following the [[Unite the Right rally|white nationalist rally in Charlottesville]], Presiding Bishop Michael B. Curry said that "the stain of bigotry has once again covered our land" and called on Episcopalians to choose "organized love intent on creating God's beloved community on Earth" rather than hate.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.episcopalnewsservice.org/2017/08/17/presiding-bishop-reflects-on-charlottesville-and-its-aftermath/|title=Presiding Bishop reflects on Charlottesville and its aftermath|date=2017-08-17|work=Episcopal News Service|access-date=2018-09-05}}</ref>

====Abortion ====
The church is totally opposed to the use of abortion as a means of birth control or family planning, but considers it a woman's right to receive one.<ref name=PewAbortion>[http://www.pewforum.org/2013/01/16/religious-groups-official-positions-on-abortion/ "Religious Groups' Official Positions on Abortion"].

====Euthanasia====
The Episcopal Church disapproves of assisted suicide and other forms of euthanasia, but does teach that it is permissible to withdraw medical treatment, such as artificial nutrition and hydration, when the burden of such treatment outweighs its benefits to an individual.<ref name=PewEndofLife>[http://www.pewforum.org/2013/11/21/religious-groups-views-on-end-of-life-issues/ "Religious Groups' Views on End-of-Life Issues"].

==Agencies and programs==
The Society for the Increase of the Ministry (SIM) is the only organization raising funds on a national basis for Episcopal seminarian support. SIM's founding purpose in 1857 – "to find suitable persons for the Episcopal ministry and aid them in acquiring a thorough education". SIM has awarded scholarships to qualified full-time seminary students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simministry.org|title=The Society for the Increase of the Ministry - Investing in the future ordained leaders of The Episcopal Church since 1857|author=designthemes|work=simministry.org}}</ref>

[[Episcopal Relief & Development]] is the international relief and development agency of the Episcopal Church of the United States. It helps to rebuild after disasters and aims to empower people by offering lasting solutions that fight poverty, hunger and disease. Episcopal Relief and Development programs focus on alleviating hunger, improving food supply, creating economic opportunities, strengthening communities, promoting health, fighting disease, responding to disasters, and rebuilding communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.er-d.org/|title=Episcopal Relief & Development|publisher=Er-d.org|access-date=2010-11-28}}</ref>

==Ecumenical relations==
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2015}}
Like the other churches of the Anglican Communion, the Episcopal Church has entered into [[full communion]] with the [[Old Catholic Church]]es of the [[Union of Utrecht (Old Catholic)|Union of Utrecht]], the [[Philippine Independent Church]], and the [[Mar Thoma Syrian Church of Malabar]]. The Episcopal Church is also in a relationship of full communion with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/6947_9255_ENG_HTM.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125063815/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/6947_9255_ENG_HTM.htm|archive-date=2009-11-25|title=Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (2001)|publisher=Office of Ecumenical & Interreligious Relations of The Episcopal Church|year=2001|access-date=2009-10-06}}</ref> and the Northern and Southern Provinces of the [[Moravian Church in America]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schjonberg|first1=Mary Frances|title=Moravian Church's Southern Province enters full communion with Episcopal Church|url=http://episcopalchurch.org/79425_124442_ENG_HTM.htm|website=Episcopal Life Online|access-date=11 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028025418/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/79425_124442_ENG_HTM.htm|archive-date=28 October 2011|date=10 September 2010}}</ref> The Episcopal Church entered into a full communion agreement with the [[Church of Sweden]] at its General Convention in [[Salt Lake City]] on June 28, 2015.

The Episcopal Church maintains ecumenical dialogues with the [[United Methodist Church]] and the [[Moravian Church in America]], and participates in pan-Anglican dialogues with the [[Oriental Orthodox|Oriental Orthodox Churches]], the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]], and the Roman Catholic Church. In 2006 a relation of interim Eucharistic sharing was inaugurated with the United Methodist Church, a step that may ultimately lead to full communion.

Historically Anglican churches have had strong ecumenical ties with the [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern Orthodox Churches]], and the Episcopal Church particularly with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], but relations in more recent years have been strained by the [[ordination of women]] and the ordination of [[Gene Robinson]] to the episcopate. A former relation of full communion with the [[Polish National Catholic Church]] (once a part of the [[Utrecht Union|Union of Utrecht]]) was broken off by the PNCC in 1976 over the ordination of women.

The Episcopal Church was a founding member of the [[Consultation on Church Union]] and participates in its successor, [[Churches Uniting in Christ]]. The Episcopal Church is a founding member of the [[National Council of Churches]], the [[World Council of Churches]], and the new [[Christian Churches Together|Christian Churches Together in the USA]]. Dioceses and parishes are frequently members of local ecumenical councils as well.
