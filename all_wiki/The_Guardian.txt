'''''The Guardian''''' is a British daily newspaper. It was founded in 1821 as ''The Manchester Guardian'', and changed its name in 1959. Along with its sister papers ''[[The Observer]]'' and ''[[The Guardian Weekly]]'', ''The Guardian'' is part of the [[Guardian Media Group]], owned by the [[Scott Trust Limited|Scott Trust]]. The trust was created in 1936 to "secure the financial and editorial independence of ''The Guardian'' in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of ''The Guardian'' free from commercial or political interference".<ref name=GST1 /> The trust was converted into a [[limited company]] in 2008, with a constitution written so as to maintain for ''The Guardian'' the same protections as were built into the structure of the Scott Trust by its creators. Profits are reinvested in journalism rather than distributed to owners or [[shareholder]]s.<ref name=GST1>{{cite news|title=The Scott Trust: values and history|url=https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/2015/jul/26/the-scott-trust|access-date=5 May 2019|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 July 2015}}</ref>

The working-class ''Manchester and Salford Advertiser'' called ''The Manchester Guardian'' "the foul [[Prostitution|prostitute]] and dirty [[parasite]] of the worst portion of the mill-owners".<ref>21 May 1836</ref> ''The Manchester Guardian'' was generally hostile to labour's claims. Of the 1832 Ten Hours Bill, the paper doubted whether in view of the foreign competition "the passing of a law positively enacting a gradual destruction of the cotton manufacture in this kingdom would be a much less rational procedure."<ref>{{cite news|title=Editorial|work=The Manchester Guardian|date=28 January 1832}}</ref> ''The Manchester Guardian'' dismissed strikes as the work of outside agitators: "[…]&nbsp;if an accommodation can be effected, the occupation of the agents of the Union is gone.

==== Slavery and the American Civil War ====
The newspaper opposed slavery and supported [[free trade]]. An 1823 leading article on the continuing "cruelty and injustice" to slaves in the [[West Indies]] long after the abolition of the slave trade with the [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] wanted fairness to the interests and claims both of the planters and of their oppressed slaves.<ref name="Guardian 1511 2012">{{cite web | title=The cruelty and injustice of negro slavery: From the Guardian archive, 15 Nov 1823 | website=the Guardian | date=15 November 2012 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/nov/15/slavery-injustice-abolition-british-1823 | access-date=28 June 2020}}</ref> It welcomed the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]] and accepted the "increased compensation" to the planters as the "guilt of slavery attaches far more to the nation" rather than individuals.

[[File:Abraham Lincoln, Lincoln Square, Manchester.jpg|thumb|Statue of Lincoln in Manchester, with extracts from the working men's letter and his reply on its base.]]
There was division in Britain over the Civil War, even within political parties. The ''Manchester Guardian'' had also been conflicted. It had supported other [[Age of Revolution|independence movements]] and felt it should also support the rights of the Confederacy to self-determination. It criticised Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]] for not freeing all American slaves.<ref name="Kettle"/> On 10 October 1862, it wrote: "It is impossible to cast any reflections upon a man so evidently sincere and well-intentioned as Mr Lincoln but it is also impossible not to feel that it was an evil day both for America and the world, when he was chosen President of the United States".<ref name="Ayerst1971">{{cite book|author=David Ayerst|title=The Manchester Guardian: Biography of a Newspaper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RhZlAAAAMAAJ|year=1971|pages=154–155|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-0642-3}}</ref> By then, the [[Union blockade]] was causing [[Lancashire Cotton Famine#Politics|suffering in British towns]]. Some including [[Liverpool]] supported the Confederacy as did  "current opinion in all classes" in London. On 31 December 1862, cotton workers held a meeting at the [[Free Trade Hall]] in [[Manchester]] which resolved "its detestation of negro slavery in America, and of the attempt of the rebellious Southern slave-holders to organise on the great American continent a nation having slavery as its basis". There was a comment that "an effort had been made in a leading article of the ''Manchester Guardian'' to deter the working men from assembling together for such a purpose". The newspaper reported all this and published their letter to President Lincoln<ref name="Rodrigues 2013">{{cite web | last=Rodrigues | first=Jason | title=From the archive: 1863, Lincoln's great debt to Manchester | website=the Guardian | date=4 February 2013 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2013/feb/04/lincoln-oscars-manchester-cotton-abraham | access-date=3 July 2020}}<br>{{cite web | title=Full text of "Manchester and Abraham Lincoln : a side-light on an earlier fight for freedom" | website=Internet Archive | date=10 June 2020 | url=https://archive.org/stream/manchesterabraha00hour/manchesterabraha00hour_djvu.txt | access-date=3 July 2020}}</ref> while complaining that "the chief occupation, if not the chief object of the meeting, seems to have been to abuse the ''Manchester Guardian''".<ref name="Ayerst1971"/> Lincoln replied to the letter thanking the workers for their "sublime Christian heroism" and American ships delivered relief supplies to Britain.<ref name="Rodrigues 2013"/>

The newspaper reported the shock to the community of the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]] in 1865, concluding that "[t]he parting of his family with the dying President is too sad for description",<ref name="Guardian 1402 2015">{{cite web | title=The assassination of President Lincoln, 14 April 1865 | website=the Guardian | date=14 April 2015 | url=http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/from-the-archive-blog/2015/apr/14/president-lincoln-assassination-1865 | access-date=3 July 2020}}</ref> but in what from today's perspective looks an ill-judged editorial wrote that "[o]f his rule we can never speak except as a series of acts abhorrent to every true notion of constitutional right and human liberty", adding "it is doubtless to be regretted that he had not the opportunity of vindicating his good intentions".<ref name="Kettle"/>

According to [[Martin Kettle]], writing for ''The Guardian'' in February 2011, "''The Guardian'' had always hated slavery. But it doubted the Union hated slavery to the same degree. It argued that the Union had always tacitly condoned slavery by shielding the southern slave states from the condemnation they deserved. It was critical of Lincoln's emancipation proclamation for stopping short of a full repudiation of slavery throughout the US. And it chastised the president for being so willing to negotiate with the south, with slavery one of the issues still on the table".<ref>{{cite news|last=Kettle|first=Martin|date=24 February 2011|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/feb/24/1865-guardian-stance-us-civil-war|title=Lincoln, evil?

====C. P. Scott====
[[C. P. Scott]] made the newspaper nationally recognised. He was editor for 57 years from 1872, and became its owner when he bought the paper from the estate of Taylor's son in 1907. Under Scott, the paper's moderate editorial line became more radical, supporting [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] when the Liberals split in 1886, and opposing the [[Second Boer War]] against popular opinion.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hampton, Mark|year=2011|title=The Press, Patriotism, and Public Discussion: C.

Scott thought the Suffragettes' "courage and devotion" was "worthy of a better cause and saner leadership".<ref>Quoted in David Ayerst, ''The Guardian'', 1971, p. 353.</ref> It has been argued that Scott's criticism reflected a widespread disdain, at the time, for those women who "transgressed the gender expectations of [[Edwardian era|Edwardian society]]".<ref name="suffragettes"/>

Scott commissioned [[J. M. Synge]] and his friend [[Jack Yeats]] to produce articles and drawings documenting the social conditions of the west of Ireland; these pieces were published in 1911 in the collection ''Travels in Wicklow, West Kerry and Connemara''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Arnold |first=Bruce |title=To the waters and the wild |newspaper=[[Irish Independent]] |location=Dublin |date=27 November 2012 |url=http://www.independent.ie/incoming/to-the-waters-and-the-wild-26527736.html |access-date=4 June 2014}}</ref>

Scott's friendship with [[Chaim Weizmann]] played a role in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]]. In 1948 ''The Manchester Guardian'' was a supporter of the new State of [[Israel]].

In 1919, the paper's special correspondent [[William Thomas Goode|W. T. Goode]] travelled to Moscow and secured interviews with [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other Soviet leaders.<ref name="Goode-BaW">{{cite book |last1=Goode |first1=William Thomas |title=Bolshevism at Work |year=1920 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.97620/ |publisher=George Allen & Unwin |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref><ref name="Guardian2011">{{cite news |last1=Goode |first1=W.T. |title=1919: Lenin agrees to Guardian interview |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/21/the-guardian-interviews-lenin-1919 |access-date=7 March 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=21 May 2011}}</ref>

Ownership of the paper passed in June 1936 to the [[Scott Trust]] (named after the last owner, John Russell Scott, who was the first chairman of the Trust). This move ensured the paper's independence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust |title=The Scott Trust |work=The Guardian |access-date=2 September 2018}}</ref>

[[Sylvia Sprigge]] served as correspondent for ''The Manchester Guardian'' in [[Italy]] 1943–1953.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Collection: Sylvia Sprigge papers {{!}} HOLLIS for|url=https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/24/resources/7455|access-date=2020-10-07|website=hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu|archive-date=21 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201121073108/https://hollisarchives.lib.harvard.edu/repositories/24/resources/7455|url-status=live}}</ref>

From 1930 to 1967, a special archival copy of all the daily newspapers was preserved in 700 zinc cases. These were found in 1988 whilst the newspaper's archives were deposited at the [[University of Manchester]]'s [[John Rylands University Library]], on the Oxford Road campus. The first case was opened and found to contain the newspapers issued in August 1930 in pristine condition. The zinc cases had been made each month by the newspaper's plumber and stored for posterity. The other 699 cases were not opened and were all returned to storage at ''The Guardian''{{'}}s garage, owing to shortage of space at the library.<ref>Taylor, Geoffrey (11 April 1988) "Bowled over by treasures at the bottom of the zinc"; ''The Guardian''</ref>

====Spanish Civil War====
Traditionally affiliated with the centrist to centre-left [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], and with a northern, non-conformist circulation base, the paper earned a national reputation and the respect of the left during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939). [[George Orwell]] writes in ''[[Homage to Catalonia#Appendix one|Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938): "Of our larger papers, the ''Manchester Guardian'' is the only one that leaves me with an increased respect for its honesty". With the pro-Liberal ''[[News Chronicle]]'', the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]-supporting ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'', the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]]'s ''[[Morning Star (British newspaper)|Daily Worker]]'' and several Sunday and weekly papers, it supported the Republican government against General [[Francisco Franco]]'s insurgent nationalists.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

====Post-war====
The paper's then editor, [[A. P. Wadsworth]], so loathed Labour's [[left-wing]] champion [[Aneurin Bevan]], who had made a reference to getting rid of "Tory Vermin" in a speech "and the hate-gospellers of his entourage" that it encouraged readers to vote Conservative and remove [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]]'s post-war Labour government.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Manchester Guardian|author=Leader|date=22 October 1951|title=Time for change?}}</ref> The newspaper opposed the creation of the [[National Health Service]] as it feared the state provision of healthcare would "eliminate selective elimination" and lead to an increase of congenitally deformed and feckless people.<ref>{{cite book |title=Austerity Britain 1945–1951 |first=David |last=Kynaston |author-link=David Kynaston |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7475-9923-4 |page=285}}</ref>

''The Manchester Guardian'' strongly opposed military intervention during the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]]: "The Anglo-French ultimatum to Egypt is an act of folly, without justification in any terms but brief expediency. It pours petrol on a growing fire. There is no knowing what kind of explosion will follow."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/10/pressandpublishing.egypt | title=Courage under fire | work=The Guardian | date=10 July 2006 | access-date=5 March 2014 | author=Rusbridger Alan | archive-date=30 August 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830063430/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/10/pressandpublishing.egypt | url-status=live }}.

On 24 August 1959, ''The Manchester Guardian'' changed its name to ''The Guardian''. This change reflected the growing prominence of national and international affairs in the newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/2002/jun/11/1|title=Key moments in the Guardian's history: a timeline|date=16 November 2017|website=The Guardian|access-date=3 April 2018}}</ref> In September 1961, ''The Guardian'', which had previously only been published in [[Manchester]], began to be printed in [[London]].<ref>''The Press and the People''.

===1972 to 2000===

====Northern Ireland conflict====
When 13 civil rights demonstrators in [[Northern Ireland]] were killed by British soldiers on 30 January 1972 (known as [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]]), ''The Guardian'' said that "Neither side can escape condemnation."<ref name="BloodySunday"/> Of the protesters, they wrote, "The organizers of the demonstration, Miss [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey|Bernadette Devlin]] among them, deliberately challenged the ban on marches. They knew that stone throwing and [[sniping]] could not be prevented, and that the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] might use the [[human shield|crowd as a shield]]."<ref name="BloodySunday">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1972/feb/01/bloodysunday.northernireland1|title=The division deepens|work=The Guardian|date=1 February 1972|author=Leader | location=London}}</ref> Of the army, they wrote, "there seems little doubt that random shots were fired into the crowd, that aim was taken at individuals who were neither bombers nor weapons carriers and that excessive force was used".<ref name="BloodySunday"/>

Many Irish people believed that the [[Widgery Tribunal]]'s ruling on the killings was a whitewash,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/19/newsid_2491000/2491125.stm |title=19 April 1972: 'Bloody Sunday' report excuses Army |publisher=BBC |year=2008 |access-date=28 July 2009 |work=On this day 1950–2005 |archive-date=6 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106153121/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/19/newsid_2491000/2491125.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> a view that was later supported with the publication of the [[Saville inquiry]] in 2010,<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowcott |first=Owen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/16/bloody-sunday-inquiry-derry-verdict |title=Bloody Sunday inquiry: 'We always knew the dead were innocent' |work=The Guardian|date=16 June 2010 |access-date=11 August 2013}}</ref> but in 1972 ''The Guardian'' declared that "Widgery's report is not one-sided" (20 April 1972).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1972/apr/20/bloodysunday.northernireland|title=To make history repeat itself|work=The Guardian|date=20 April 1972|author=Leader | location=London}}</ref> At the time the paper also supported [[internment]] without trial in Northern Ireland: "Internment without trial is hateful, repressive and undemocratic. In the existing Irish situation, most regrettably, it is also inevitable... .To remove the ringleaders, in the hope that the atmosphere might calm down, is a step to which there is no obvious alternative."<ref>''The Guardian'', leader, 10 August 1971</ref> Before then, ''The Guardian'' had called for British troops to be sent to the region: British soldiers could "present a more disinterested face of law and order,"<ref>''The Guardian'', leader, 15 August 1969</ref> but only on condition that "Britain takes charge."<ref>''The Guardian'', leader, 4 August 1969</ref>

====Sarah Tisdall====
In 1983 the paper was at the centre of a controversy surrounding documents regarding the stationing of [[cruise missile]]s in Britain that were leaked to ''The Guardian'' by civil servant [[Sarah Tisdall]]. The paper eventually complied with a court order to hand over the documents to the authorities, which resulted in a six-month prison sentence for Tisdall,<ref>{{cite news|first=Paul |last=Routledge |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/profile-hunter-of-the-truth-lord-justice-scott-with-the-government-rattled-paul-routledge-looks-at-the-man-john-major-now-has-to-face-1407249.html |title=Profile: Hunter of the truth: Lord justice Scott: With the Government rattled, Paul Routledge looks at the man John Major now has to face &#124; Voices |work=The Independent|date=16 January 1994 |access-date=6 March 2016}}</ref> though she served only four.

====First Gulf War====
In the lead-up to the first [[Gulf War]], between 1990 and 1991, ''The Guardian'' expressed doubts about military action against Iraq: "Frustration in the Gulf leads temptingly to the invocation of task forces and tactical bombing, but the military option is no option at all. The emergence yesterday of a potential hostage problem of vast dimensions only emphasised that this is far too complex a crisis for gunboat diplomacy. Loose talk of 'carpet bombing' Baghdad should be put back in the bottle of theoretical but unacceptable scenarios."<ref>{{cite news|title=Choosing the best option|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=6 August 1990|author=Leader}}</ref>

[[File:First Gulf War Plaque, Stafford War Memorial - geograph.org.uk - 1405400.jpg|thumb|First Gulf War Plaque, Stafford War Memorial]]

But on the eve of the war, the paper rallied to the war cause: "The simple cause, at the end, is just. An evil regime in Iraq instituted an evil and brutal invasion. Our soldiers and airmen are there, at UN behest, to set that evil to rights. Their duties are clear.&nbsp;... Let the momentum, and the resolution, be swift."<ref>{{cite news|title=Suddenly the sky turns orange|work=The Guardian|date=17 January 1991|author=Leader}}</ref> After the event, journalist [[Maggie O'Kane]] conceded that she and her colleagues had been a mouthpiece for war propaganda: "...&nbsp;we, the media, were harnessed like 2,000 beach donkeys and led through the sand to see what the British and US military wanted us to see in this nice clean war".<ref>"Bloodless words bloody war: In a Guardian/Channel 4 investigation across three continents, Maggie O'Kane follows the trail of lies, cover-ups and carnage that were the truth behind the 'clean' war in the Gulf."

====Alleged penetration by Russian intelligence====
In 1994, [[KGB]] defector [[Oleg Gordievsky]] identified ''Guardian'' literary editor [[Richard Gott]] as "an agent of influence". While Gott denied that he received cash, he admitted he had had lunch at the Soviet Embassy and had taken benefits from the KGB on overseas visits.

In May 1998, a series of ''Guardian'' investigations exposed the wholesale fabrication of a much-garlanded ITV documentary ''The Connection'', produced by [[Carlton Television#Factual inaccuracy in 1996 documentary|Carlton Television.]]

====''Guardian America'' and ''Guardian US''====
In 2007, the paper launched ''Guardian America'', an attempt to capitalise on its large online readership in the United States, which at the time stood at more than 5.9 million. The company hired former ''[[American Prospect]]'' editor, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine columnist and ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' writer [[Michael Tomasky]] to head the project and hire a staff of American reporters and web editors. The site featured news from ''The Guardian'' that was relevant to an American audience: coverage of US news and the Middle East, for example.<ref>{{cite web|author=Leon Neyfakh |url=http://observer.com/2007/09/iguardiani-reclaims-america/ |title=Guardian Reclaims America |publisher=Observer |date=5 September 2007 |access-date=6 March 2016}}</ref>

Tomasky stepped down from his position as editor of ''Guardian America'' in February 2009, ceding editing and planning duties to other US and London staff. He retained his position as a columnist and blogger, taking the title editor-at-large.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/18/michael-tomasky-editor-democracy|title=Michael Tomasky joins political journal Democracy|work=The Guardian |location=London |date=18 February 2009|last=Kiss|first=Jemima|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref>

The move came as ''Guardian News and Media'' opted to reconsider its US strategy amid a huge effort to cut costs across the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.org/2009/11/06/419-guardian-news-and-media-laying-off-seven-employees-in-u-s/ |title=Guardian News And Media Laying Off Six Employees in U.S.|first=Rafat|last=Ali|access-date=11 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624012953/http://paidcontent.org/2009/11/06/419-guardian-news-and-media-laying-off-seven-employees-in-u-s/ |archive-date=24 June 2013}}</ref> In subsequent years, however, ''The Guardian'' has hired various commentators on US affairs including [[Ana Marie Cox]], [[Michael Wolff (journalist)|Michael Wolff]], [[Naomi Wolf]], [[Glenn Greenwald]] and George W.

Legal obstacles, which cannot be identified, involve proceedings, which cannot be mentioned, on behalf of a client who must remain secret. The only fact ''The Guardian'' can report is that the case involves the London solicitors [[Carter-Ruck]]."

''The Guardian'' is part of the [[Guardian Media Group]] (GMG) of newspapers, radio stations and print media, including; ''[[The Observer]]'' Sunday newspaper, ''[[The Guardian Weekly]]'' international newspaper, and new media—''Guardian Abroad'' website, and ''[[theguardian.com|guardian.co.uk]]''.

''The Guardian''{{'s}} ownership by the Scott Trust is probably a factor in its being the only British national daily to conduct (since 2003) an annual social, ethical and environmental [[audit]] in which it examines, under the scrutiny of an independent external auditor, its own behaviour as a company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/values/socialaudit |title=Living Our Values: Social, Ethical and Environmental Audit 2006 |access-date=11 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006205919/http://www.theguardian.com/values/socialaudit |archive-date=6 October 2014}}</ref> It is also the only British national daily newspaper to employ an internal ombudsman (called the "readers' editor") to handle complaints and corrections.

''The Guardian'' and its parent groups participate in [[Project Syndicate]] and intervened in 1995 to save the ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'' in South Africa. However, GMG sold the majority of its shares of the ''Mail & Guardian'' in 2002.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The continual losses made by the National Newspaper division of the ''Guardian Media Group'' caused it to dispose of its Regional Media division by selling titles to competitor ''[[Trinity Mirror]]'' in March 2010. This included the flagship ''[[Manchester Evening News]]'', and severed the historic link between that paper and ''The Guardian''.

In June 2011 ''Guardian News and Media'' revealed increased annual losses of £33m and announced that it was looking to focus on its online edition for news coverage, leaving the print edition to contain more comments and features.

Between 2007 and 2014 ''The Guardian Media Group'' sold all their side businesses, of regional papers and online portals for classifieds and consolidated, into ''The Guardian'' as sole product. The sales let them acquire a capital stock of £838.3m as of July 2014, supposed to guarantee the independence of the ''Guardian'' in perpetuity.

The Guardian Media Group's 2018 annual report (year ending 1 April 2018) indicated some significant changes occurring. Its digital (online) editions accounted for over 50% of group revenues by that time; the loss from news and media operations was £18.6m, 52% lower than during the prior year (2017: £38.9m). The Group had cut costs by £19.1m, partly by switching its print edition to the tabloid format.

In 2016, the company established a U.S.-based philanthropic arm to raise money from individuals and organizations including think tanks and corporate foundations. The grants are focused by the donors on particular issues. By the following year, the organization had raised $1 million from the likes of [[Pierre Omidyar]]'s Humanity United, the [[Skoll Foundation]], and the [[Conrad N.

==Political stance and editorial opinion==
Founded by textile traders and merchants, in its early years ''The Guardian'' had a reputation as "an organ of the middle class",<ref>[[Frederick Engels]], ''The Condition of the Working Class in England'', Progress, 1973, p 109.</ref> or in the words of C.

On 6 November 2011, Chris Elliott, ''The Guardian''{{'}}s readers' editor, wrote that "''Guardian'' reporters, writers and editors must be more vigilant about the language they use when writing about Jews or Israel," citing recent cases where ''The Guardian'' received complaints regarding language chosen to describe Jews or Israel. Elliott noted that, over nine months, he upheld complaints regarding language in certain articles that were seen as anti-Semitic, revising the language and footnoting this change.<ref name="Elliott responds">{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/06/averting-accusations-of-antisemitism-guardian | title=The readers' editor on&nbsp;... averting accusations of antisemitism | work=The Guardian| date=6 November 2011 | access-date=3 October 2012 | author=Elliott, Chris}}</ref>

In response, the UN security council issued resolution 478, censuring the "change in character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem" and calling on all member states with diplomatic missions in the city to withdraw. The UN has reaffirmed this position on several occasions, and almost every country now has its embassy in Tel Aviv. While it was therefore right to issue a correction to make clear Israel's designation of Jerusalem as its capital is not recognised by the international community, we accept that it is wrong to state that Tel Aviv – the country's financial and diplomatic centre – is the capital.

On 11 August 2014 the print edition of ''The Guardian'' published a pro-Israeli advocacy advert during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]] featuring [[Elie Wiesel]], headed by the words "Jews rejected child sacrifice 3,500 years ago.

===Publication history===
{{more citations needed section|date=March 2016}}

[[File:GuardianNewsroom.jpg|thumb|right|''The Guardian''{{'s}} Newsroom visitor centre and archive (No 60), with an old sign with the name ''The Manchester Guardian'']]

The first edition was published on 5 May 1821,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus-educational.com/PRguardian.htm |title=Manchester Guardian |publisher=Spartacus-educational.com |access-date=6 March 2016}}</ref> at which time ''The Guardian'' was a weekly, published on Saturdays and costing 7[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]]; the [[stamp duty]] on newspapers (4d per sheet) forced the price up so high that it was uneconomic to publish more frequently. When the stamp duty was cut in 1836, ''The Guardian'' added a Wednesday edition and with the abolition of the tax in 1855 it became a daily paper costing 2d.

In October 1952, the paper took the step of printing news on the front page, replacing the adverts that had hitherto filled that space. Then-editor A. P. Wadsworth wrote: "It is not a thing I like myself, but it seems to be accepted by all the newspaper pundits that it is preferable to be in fashion."<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Manchester Guardian; biography of a newspaper|last=David.|first=Ayerst|date=1971|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0801406423|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|oclc=149105|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/manchesterguardi0000ayer}}</ref>

In 1959, the paper dropped "Manchester" from its title, becoming simply ''The Guardian'', and in 1964 it moved to London, losing some of its regional agenda but continuing to be heavily subsidised by sales of the more downmarket but more profitable ''Manchester Evening News''. The financial position remained extremely poor into the 1970s; at one time it was in merger talks with ''The Times''. The paper consolidated its centre-left stance during the 1970s and 1980s. It was both shocked and revitalised by the launch of ''The Independent'' in 1986 which competed for a similar readership and provoked the entire broadsheet industry into a fight for circulation.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}
[[File:Sima Wali on the front page of The Guardian newspaper in 2001.jpg|thumb|Front page of ''The Guardian'' from 2001, showing the old design of the paper when in broadsheet format. This design was used from 1988 to 2005]]
On 12 February 1988, ''The Guardian'' had a significant redesign; as well as improving the quality of its printers' ink, it also changed its masthead to a juxtaposition of an [[italic type|italic]] [[Garamond]] "''The''", with a bold [[Helvetica]] "Guardian", that remained in use until the 2005 redesign.

In 1992, ''The Guardian'' relaunched its features section as ''G2'', a tabloid-format supplement. This innovation was widely copied by the other "quality" broadsheets and ultimately led to the rise of "compact" papers and ''The Guardian''{{'s}} move to the [[Berliner (format)|Berliner format]]. In 1993 the paper declined to participate in the broadsheet [[price war]] started by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s ''The Times''. In June 1993, ''The Guardian'' bought ''The Observer'' from [[Lonrho]], thus gaining a serious [[Sunday editions|Sunday sister newspaper]] with similar political views.

Its international weekly edition is now titled ''The Guardian Weekly'', though it retained the title ''Manchester Guardian Weekly'' for some years after the home edition had moved to London. It includes sections from a number of other internationally significant newspapers of a somewhat left-of-centre inclination, including ''[[Le Monde]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. ''The Guardian Weekly'' was also linked to a website for expatriates, ''Guardian Abroad'', which was launched in 2007 but had been taken offline by 2012.

}}</ref> and was the first newspaper in the UK to use the [[Berliner (format)|Berliner]] format for its main section, while producing sections and supplements in a range of page sizes including tabloid, approximately A4, and pocket-size (approximately A5).

In 2004, ''The Guardian'' announced plans to change to a Berliner or "midi" format, similar to that used by ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'' in Germany, ''[[Le Monde]]'' in France and many other European papers. At 470×315&nbsp;mm, this is slightly larger than a traditional [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]. Planned for the autumn of 2005, this change followed moves by ''The Independent'' and ''[[The Times]]'' to start publishing in tabloid (or compact) format. On Thursday, 1 September 2005, ''The Guardian'' announced that it would launch the new format on Monday 12 September 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/sep/01/theguardian.pressandpublishing|title=New-look Guardian launches on September 12|work=MediaGuardian|date=1 September 2005|last1=Cozens|first1=Claire|location=London|publisher=Guardian News and Media}}</ref> Sister Sunday newspaper ''The Observer'' also changed to this new format on 8 January 2006.

The advantage ''The Guardian'' saw in the Berliner format was that, though it is only a little wider than a tabloid, and is equally easy to read on public transport, its greater height gives more flexibility in page design. The new presses mean that printing can go across the strip down the middle of the centre page, known as the "gutter", allowing the paper to print full double-page pictures. The new presses also made it the first UK national paper to print in full colour on every page.

The format switch was accompanied by a comprehensive redesign of the paper's look. On Friday, 9 September 2005, the newspaper unveiled its newly designed front page, which débuted on Monday 12 September 2005. Designed by [[Mark Porter (designer)|Mark Porter]], the new look includes a new [[Masthead (British publishing)|masthead]] for the newspaper, its first since 1988. A typeface family designed by [[Paul Barnes (designer)|Paul Barnes]] and [[Christian Schwartz]] was created for the new design. With just over 200 fonts, it was described as "one of the most ambitious custom type programs ever commissioned by a newspaper".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Crossgrove|first1=Carl|title=Guardian: review|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/guardian/|website=Typographica|access-date=11 July 2015}}</ref><ref name="fontshop2006">{{cite web

 |archive-date = 4 June 2012}}</ref> Among the fonts is [[Guardian Egyptian]], a [[slab serif]] that is used in various weights for both text and headlines, and is central to the redesign.

The switch cost ''Guardian Newspapers'' £80&nbsp;million and involved setting up new printing presses in east London and Manchester. This switch was necessary because, before ''The Guardian''{{'s}} move, no printing presses in Britain could produce newspapers in the Berliner format. There were additional complications, as one of the paper's presses was part-owned by ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph Newspapers]]'' and ''[[The Daily Express|Express Newspapers]]'', contracted to use the plant until 2009. Another press was shared with the ''Guardian Media Group's'' north-western tabloid local papers, which did not wish to switch to the Berliner format.

====Reception====
The new format was generally well received by ''Guardian'' readers, who were encouraged to provide feedback on the changes. The only controversy was over the dropping of the ''[[Doonesbury]]'' cartoon strip. The paper reported thousands of calls and emails complaining about its loss; within 24 hours the decision was reversed and the strip was reinstated the following week. ''G2'' supplement editor Ian Katz, who was responsible for dropping it, apologised in the editors' blog saying, "I'm sorry, once again, that I made you—and the hundreds of fellow fans who have called our helpline or mailed our comments' address—so cross."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/values/socialaudit/story/0%2C%2C1600349%2C00.html |title=''Guardian Reborn'', The Guardian |access-date=5 May 2017 |url-status = bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212135000/http://www.guardian.co.uk/values/socialaudit/story/0%2C%2C1600349%2C00.html |archive-date=12 February 2007}}.

The format change is intended to help cut costs as it allows the paper to be printed by a wider array of presses, and outsourcing the printing to presses owned by Trinity Mirror is expected to save millions of pounds annually.

==Guardian News & Media archive==
{{more citations needed section|date=March 2016}}

''The Guardian'' and its sister newspaper ''The Observer'' opened The Newsroom, an archive and visitor centre in London, in 2002. The centre preserved and promoted the histories and values of the newspapers through its archive, educational programmes and exhibitions. The Newsroom's activities were all transferred to [[Kings Place]] in 2008.<ref name="test">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/interactive/guardian-interactive-timeline |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Lisa |last=Villani |title=MIC: GNM archive (microsite) |date=20 August 2009}}</ref> Now known as the Guardian News & Media archive, the archive preserves and promotes the histories and values of ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'' newspapers by collecting and making accessible material that provides an accurate and comprehensive history of the papers. The archive holds official records of ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'', and also seeks to acquire material from individuals who have been associated with the papers. As well as corporate records, the archive holds correspondence, diaries, notebooks, original cartoons and photographs belonging to staff of the papers.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/archive-collections |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=MIC: GNM archive (microsite) |date=26 August 2009}}</ref> This material may be consulted by members of the public by prior appointment. An extensive ''Manchester Guardian'' archive also exists at the University of Manchester's John Rylands University Library, and there is a collaboration programme between the two archives. Additionally, the [[British Library]] has a large archive of ''The Manchester Guardian'' available in its British Library Newspapers collection, in online, hard copy, microform, and CD-ROM formats.

In November 2007, ''The Guardian'' and ''The Observer'' made their archives available over the internet via DigitalArchive. The current extent of the archives available are 1821 to 2000 for ''The Guardian'' and 1791 to 2000 for ''The Observer'': these archives will eventually run up to 2003.

The Newsroom's other components were also transferred to Kings Place in 2008. ''The Guardian''{{'s}} Education Centre provides a range of educational programmes for students and adults. ''The Guardian''{{'s}} exhibition space was also moved to Kings Place, and has a rolling programme of exhibitions that investigate and reflect upon aspects of news and newspapers and the role of journalism. This programme often draws on the archive collections held in the GNM Archive.
