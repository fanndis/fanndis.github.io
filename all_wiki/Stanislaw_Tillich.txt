'''Stanislaw Tillich''' ({{IPA-de|ˈstanɪslaf ˈtɪlɪç|-|}}; {{lang-hsb|Stanisław Tilich}}; born 10 April 1959) is a [[Germany|German]] [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] [[politician]]. He served as the 3rd [[Minister-President|Minister President]] of [[Saxony]] from 2008 to 2017. From 1 November 2015 until 31 October 2016 he was [[President of the Bundesrat]] and ''ex officio'' deputy to the [[President of Germany]]. Tillich is of [[Sorbs|Sorbian]] [[ethnicity]] and lives in [[Panschwitz-Kuckau]] (Pančicy-Kukow), which is 35 kilometres north-east of [[Dresden]] near [[Kamenz]].

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Räckelwitz|Neudörfel]] ([[Sorbian language|Sorbian]]: ''Nowa Wjeska'') near Kamenz ([[Sorbian language|Sorbian]]: ''Kamjenc''), Tillich studied construction and drive techniques at the [[Dresden University of Technology]] after finishing his [[Abitur]] at the [[Sorbs|Sorbian]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Bautzen]] in 1977. He graduated from university with a [[Diplom]]ingenieur degree in 1984. Tillich was an employee of the district administration of [[Kamenz (district)|Kamenz]] between 1987 and 1989. Later he became an entrepreneur.

==Political career==
Stanislaw Tillich joined the [[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)]] in 1987 and became a member of the CDU after [[German reunification]] in 1990. He was a member of the [[Volkskammer]] in 1990 and was delegated as an observer of the [[European Parliament]] between 1991 and 1994. He joined the [[European People's Party]] and was a member of the European Parliament between 1994 and 1999 where he was the Parliament's rapporteur on the [[Budget of the European Union|1998 EU budget]].<ref>Simon Coss (January 1, 2014), [http://www.politico.eu/article/member-states-urged-to-support-plan-to-boost-small-business-funding/ Member states urged to support plan to boost small business funding] ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref>

Tillich has been a minister in the government of Saxony since 1999. He was State Minister for Federal and European Affairs until 2002 when he became State Minister and head of the ''[[Sächsische Staatskanzlei|Staatskanzlei]]''. In 2004 he became the Saxon State Minister for Environment and Agriculture. He became State Minister of Finance in 2007 and has been a member of the [[Landtag of Saxony]] since 2004.

===Minister-President of Saxony, 2008-2017===
Tillich was proposed by [[Georg Milbradt]] on 14 April 2008 to become his successor as the Minister-President of Saxony. The [[Landtag of Saxony]] elected him on 28 May 2008. He is the first [[Sorbs|Sorbian]] [[head of government]] in more than thousand years of Sorbian-German coexistence in [[History of Saxony|Saxony]].

In the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] of the Christian Democrats (CDU together with the Bavarian [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]) and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP) following the [[2009 German federal election|2009 national elections]], Tillich was part of the CDU/CSU delegation in the working group on economic affairs and energy policy, led by [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg]] and [[Rainer Brüderle]].

Since 2010, Tillich has been a member of the Christian Democratic Union's 20-strong executive board.<ref>Leon Mangasarian (October 23, 2012), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-10-22/merkel-s-tough-love-crisis-stance-key-to-2013-vote-tillich-says Merkel’s Tough Love Crisis Stance Key to 2013 Vote, Tillich Says] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> By 2012, opinion polls put the backing of Tillich's CDU at 44 percent, at the time the highest level of support in any of the 16 German federal states; this made commentators describe him as “Germany’s second most-powerful politician from the formerly Communist East“ after [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]].<ref>Leon Mangasarian (October 23, 2012), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-10-22/merkel-s-tough-love-crisis-stance-key-to-2013-vote-tillich-says Merkel’s Tough Love Crisis Stance Key to 2013 Vote, Tillich Says] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref>

Tillich participated in the exploratory talks between the CDU, CSU and SPD parties to form a coalition government under Merkel following the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal elections]].<ref>Arne Delfs and Patrick Donahue (September 30, 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-29/germany-readies-for-weeks-of-coalition-talks-as-parties-position Germany Sets Coalition Talks Date as Weeks of Bartering Loom] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref>

Tillich won reelection in the [[2014 Saxony state election|2014 state elections]]. Ahead of the elections, he had soon put an end to speculation that he might team up with the newly founded [[Alternative for Germany|AfD]], which the CDU instead attempted to characterize as a fringe movement that flirts with the far right.<ref>Stephen Brown and Annika Breidthardt (August 31, 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-saxony-idUSKBN0GV0MU20140831 Merkel's conservatives set to hold Saxony, euroskeptics make breakthrough] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> At the time, Saxony was the first of three eastern regions to hold elections in a two-week span, with [[Brandenburg]] and [[Thuringia]] later rounding off the first set of electoral since Merkel won a third term.

As one of Saxony's representatives at the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], Tillich served as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs from October 2016. In addition, he was a member of the German-Russian Friendship Group set up in cooperation with [[Russia]]'s [[Federation Council (Russia)|Federation Council]].

When the AfD overtook the CDU for the first time to emerge as Saxony's most popular party in the [[2017 German federal election|2017 national elections]], Tillich resigned and [[Michael Kretschmer]] took over.<ref>Guy Chazan (August 30, 2019), [https://www.ft.com/content/c6da76c2-ca3d-11e9-a1f4-3669401ba76f The premier taking on Saxony’s populists with grilled sausage] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

==Life after politics==
From 2018 until 2019, Tillich co-chaired the German government's so-called coal commission, which was tasked to develop a masterplan before the end of the year on how to [[Fossil fuel phase-out|phase-out coal]] and create a new economic perspective for the country's coal-mining regions.<ref>Andreas Franke (June 6, 2018), [https://www.platts.com/latest-news/coal/london/germany-launches-commission-tasked-to-develop-26969439 Germany launches commission tasked to develop coal exit masterplan] ''[[S&P Global Platts]]''.</ref>
