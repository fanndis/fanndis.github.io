The '''''Orange County Register''''' is a paid daily [[List of newspapers in California|newspaper published in California]]. The ''Register,'' published in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], is owned by [[Digital First Media]]. [[Freedom Communications]] owned the newspaper from 1935 to 2016.

==History==
The ''Register'' was founded by a consortium as the ''Santa Ana Daily Register'' in 1905. It was sold to J.P. Baumgartner in 1906 and to J. Frank Burke in 1927. In 1935 it was bought by [[Raymond C. Hoiles]], who renamed it the ''Santa Ana Register.'' After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hoiles was one of the few newspaper publishers in the country to oppose the forced relocation of Japanese and Japanese-Americans to camps away from the West Coast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2007/11/18/in-his-own-words-rc-hoiles-on-the-wwii-japanese-internment/|title=In his own words: R.C. Hoiles on the WWII Japanese internment|last=Register|first=Orange County|date=2007-11-18|website=Orange County Register|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>  Hoiles reorganized his holdings as Freedom Newspapers, Inc. In 1950, the name was changed to Freedom Communications. The paper dropped "Santa Ana" from its title in 1952.

In 1956, the newspaper was a prominent supporter of a vociferous campaign by anti-communists against the [[Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act]], claiming that it was part of a Communist plot to establish concentration camps in [[Alaska]]. Circulation rose with the burgeoning population of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and after the ''Register'' added a morning edition in 1959.

In 1970 Hoiles' sons, Clarence and Harry, became co-publishers until 1979, when R.&nbsp;David Threshie, Clarence's son-in-law, was named to the position.

===1980s===
Faced with an aggressive push into the county by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' under then-publisher Otis Chandler, Threshie brought in 30-year-old N. Christian Anderson III as editor. Political positions were restricted to the editorial page. In 1981, the paper began publishing in full color.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In 1985, the paper assumed the name ''The Orange County Register''. In the same year it won its first [[Pulitzer Prize]], for its photographic coverage of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles. It won additional Pulitzers in 1989 for beat reporting by Edward Humes on U.S. military problems with [[night vision device|night-vision goggles]] and in 1996 for an investigation into [[Ricardo Asch]]'s fertility clinics.<ref>Graham, Harry L., ''Stop the Damned Presses!,'' pp. 183–86, Words & Pictures Press, Clear-water, FL, 2005.</ref>

===1990s===
In 1990, the newspaper launched the 24-hour OCN news channel with news and feature stories about Orange County. It closed in 2001.<ref>Moxley, R. Scott. [http://www.ocweekly.com/2001-09-27/news/so-long-ocn/full/ "So Long, OCN"], ''[[OC Weekly]]'', Orange County, 20 September 2001. Retrieved on 23 May 2015.</ref>

In 1992, Orange County Register Communications launched ''[[Excélsior]],'' a Spanish-language weekly.  In 2010 ''Excélsior'' had a circulation of 51,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.echo-media.com/MediaDetaiLNP.asp?IDNumber=5870 |title=Updated 'Excélsior' Statistics for 2010| publisher=Echo Media}}</ref> It covers Orange County's growing Hispanic community, which now numbers over a million. Julio Saenz is the editor and general manager.

In 1999, Threshie became Chairman of the Board of Freedom Communications, and N. Christian Anderson III assumed the position of publisher and [[chief executive officer]].

===2000s===
Ken Brusic was named vice president of content and executive editor in April 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Executive Leadership|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/div-212508-class-bio.html|work=The Orange County Register|accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref> In 2003, a family schism led to a sale on Oct. 9th of a majority interest in Freedom Communications to investors led by the [[Blackstone Group]] and [[Providence Equity Partners]]. Through a stock arrangement, the Hoiles family descendants retained control of the board.

In 2006, Orange County Register Communications launched the ''[[OC Post]]'', a tabloid with shortened versions of ''Register'' stories as well as news articles from the [[Associated Press]]. The paper also had its first significant staff reductions in December 2006, with 40 newsroom employees taking buyouts, along with a small number of layoffs.

By April 2007, ''The Orange County Register'' had made additional staff cuts to help maintain shareholder profit, which had averaged more than 20 percent annually in the preceding five years. Since the launch of the ''[[OC Post]]'' in 2006, OCRC{{clarify|date=November 2013}} has cut the ''Register's'' editorial staff by 10 percent, eliminated its 3% holiday bonuses for editorial staff. and postponed pay raises to editorial staff, which had averaged 3 percent annually, for six months.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In September 2007, Terry Horne replaced N. Christian Anderson III as publisher.

In June 2008, [[KTLA]], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' and [[Fox News]] reported that the ''Register'' had begun a one-month trial of outsourcing some layout and copy-editing work to India to save costs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,371228,00.html |publisher=Fox News |date=June 25, 2008 |title=OC Register to Outsource Editing to India|accessdate=2013-04-20}}</ref> The trial was not deemed a success, and since then editing has been done by the ''Register'' in Orange County. In spring of 2009, [[Freedom Communications]] instituted furloughs for all employees nationwide, followed by a permanent 5% pay cut starting in July 2009. News reports in August 2009 indicated that Freedom Communications planned to file for bankruptcy and turn control of its publications, including ''The Orange County Register'', over to its lenders.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/business/media/31paper.html |work=New York Times |title=Owner of ''Orange County Register'' May File for Bankruptcy |first1=Zachery |last1=Kouwe |date=August 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref>

In September 2009, a column written by sports columnist Mark Whicker caused controversy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/14/business/media/14register.html |work=New York Times |title=Outrage Over Column on California Kidnapping |first=Richard |last=Pérez-Peña |date=September 14, 2009 |accessdate=May 25, 2010}}</ref> In the column,<ref>{{cite news|last=Whicker |first=Mark |title=Many odd things have happened in sports the past 18 years |url=http://articles.ocregister.com/2009-09-07/sports/24660758_1_phillip-garrido-s-baseball-players-drugs |accessdate=August 6, 2011 |newspaper=The Orange County Register |date=September 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625022007/http://articles.ocregister.com/2009-09-07/sports/24660758_1_phillip-garrido-s-baseball-players-drugs |archivedate=June 25, 2011 }}</ref> Whicker wrote about various sporting events that had occurred over the preceding 18 years, and how they had been missed by [[Jaycee Dugard]], a girl who had been kidnapped, raped, and forced to bear her kidnapper's children. Whicker ended his column with the line "Jaycee, you have left the yard." The column generated widespread criticism and was parodied in blogs such as [[Deadspin]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Tommy Craggs |url=http://deadspin.com/5355893/mark-whicker-leaves-the-yard |title=Mark Whicker Leaves The Yard |publisher=Deadspin.com |date=9 September 2009 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> who called it "the single worst piece of journalism ever committed on this page," and ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.

===2010s===
On July 25, 2012, ''The Orange County Register'' and six other papers were purchased by 2100 Trust LLC.<ref>{{cite news|last=Milbourn|first=Mary Ann|title=Freedom Communications closes sale of the Register|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/trust-365495-bankruptcy-sale.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829023550/http://www.ocregister.com/articles/trust-365495-bankruptcy-sale.html|archivedate=2012-08-29|accessdate=April 1, 2013|newspaper=Orange County Register (archive)|date=July 25, 2012}}</ref> The papers continued to operate under the Freedom Communications name.<ref name=FormerOC>[http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/01/business/la-fi-oc-register-lawsuit-20131102 Ken Bensinger, "O.C.

A lawsuit was filed in October 2013 by the former owners of Freedom Communications against [[Aaron Kushner]], principal of 2100 Trust,  demanding that Kushner's company pay more than $17 million remaining on the sale. The ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote that Kushner, "a former greeting-card executive with no prior media experience," claimed that the prior owners had given him "inaccurate valuations for a host of crucial financial indicators" and that he faced "$62.3 million in unexpected financial liabilities as a result."<ref name=FormerOC /> On August 19, 2013, the ''Long Beach Register'' was launched as an edition of the ''Orange County Register'' serving the [[Long Beach, California]], community. It was focused solely on community news, including city government, public and private education, local sports coverage, business and entertainment as an intended competitor to the ''[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]]''. In addition, on January 20, 2014, ''[[The Press-Enterprise]]'' became an edition of the ''Orange County Register'' while maintaining coverage of the [[Inland Empire]].<ref name=RPE>{{cite news |url=http://www.pe.com/articles/press-686156-enterprise-community.html |title=To Our Readers: Meet the New and Enhanced Press-Enterprise |work=[[The Press-Enterprise]] |location=[[Riverside, California]] |date=January 20, 2014 |accessdate=September 23, 2014}}</ref>

On April 16, 2014, the ''Orange County Register'' launched the ''Los Angeles Register'', "more a print play than a digital one" serving [[Los Angeles County]]. It was the first time since the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Herald-Examiner]]'' folded on November 1, 1989, that a main competitor to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was launched, this time intended to be "as local as one edition can be for the entire county."<ref name=LAR1>{{cite news |last=Doctor |first=Ken |url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/04/six-things-to-consider-about-the-new-los-angeles-register/ |title=Six things to consider about the new Los Angeles Register |work=Nieman Lab |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |date=April 16, 2014 |accessdate=September 23, 2014}}</ref> Five months later, Kushner announced in a company memo that the ''Los Angeles Register'' was ending publication effective immediately.

On March 10, 2015, Aaron Kushner and his partner, Eric Spitz, resigned from executive duties at the paper and Freedom Communications Inc.

On February 12, 2016, Freedom Communications announced that the ''Orange County Register'' and the ''Press-Enterprise'' along with its websites, community weeklies and the two Spanish-Language weeklies ''Excelsior'' in Orange County and ''La Prensa'' in the Inland Empire, were being placed in a "stalking horse" auction after the company declared bankrupt at the end of 2015. Both Digital First Media and Tribune Publishing were the bidders. The auction started on March 21 and was completed on March 31, 2016. The U.S. Department of Justice blocked the sale of Freedom Communications to [[Tribune Publishing]] because it would create a newspaper monopoly in both Orange and Riverside Counties..On March 21, 2016, [[Digital First Media]] acquired both the ''Orange County Register'' and the ''Press-Enterprise'' for $52.3 million in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]].
