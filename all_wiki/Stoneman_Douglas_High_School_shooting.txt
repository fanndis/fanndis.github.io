The killing spree is the [[list of school shootings in the United States by death toll|deadliest high school shooting in United States history]], surpassing the [[Columbine High School massacre]] that killed 15, including [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|the perpetrators]], in Colorado in April 1999. The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for [[gun control]] that followed mass shootings in [[2017 Las Vegas shooting|Las Vegas]], Nevada and [[Sutherland Springs church shooting|Sutherland Springs]], Texas, in October and November 2017.

Following the shooting, the anger and frustration of Parkland student survivors intensified towards the inaction of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-dominated legislature on the wider issue of [[mass shooting]]s and [[gun violence]]. The students founded [[Never Again MSD]], an [[advocacy group]] that lobbies for legislative action on gun violence. On {{nowrap|March 9}}, Governor [[Rick Scott]] signed [[Florida Senate Bill 7026|a bill]] that implemented new restrictions to [[Gun laws in Florida|Florida's gun laws]] and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of [[school resource officer]]s.<ref name=Bill/><ref name="Sanchez">{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/us/florida-gov-scott-gun-bill/index.html |title=Florida Gov.

After the shooting, the [[Broward County Sheriff's Office]] received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, with much of the criticism being directed at Sheriff [[Scott Israel]] for not addressing loopholes that allowed Cruz to legally purchase a firearm despite his lengthy record of threatening behavior. Israel's deputies were also criticized for staying outside the school and not immediately confronting the gunman.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2019/01/03/parkland-shooting-report-backs-arming-teachers-slams-police-response/|title=Parkland shooting report backs arming teachers, slams police response|last=Steinbuch|first=Yaron|date=January 3, 2019|work=[[New York Post]]|access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref><ref name="nypost"/><ref name="Li">{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sheriff-scott-israel-removed-office-after-criticism-parkland-school-shooting-n957916|title=Sheriff Scott Israel removed from office after criticism of Parkland school shooting response|last=Li|first=David K.|date=January 11, 2019|access-date=March 26, 2019|publisher=[[NBC News]]}}</ref> This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and Israel's suspension by new Governor [[Ron DeSantis]].<ref name="Li"/> A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.<ref name="nypost"/><ref name="Li"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/parkland/florida-school-shooting/fl-ne-florida-school-shooting-commission-day-2-story.html|title=Broward Sheriff's sergeant called 'an absolute, total failure' as Parkland shooting panel slams agency|last=Fleshler|first=David|date=December 13, 2018|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref>

=== Efforts to seek help ===
The school district conducted an assessment of the handling of Cruz. According to their redacted report, which was reviewed in August 2018 by ''[[The New York Times]],'' ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', and other media, a year before the shooting Cruz had sought help from education specialists, as his grades at Stoneman Douglas were declining. He was an eighteen-year-old junior, and met with the specialists with his mother. The specialists recommended that he transfer to another school, Cross Creek in [[Pompano Beach]], where he had done well before. But he wanted to graduate with his class at Stoneman Douglas, and rejected this option, as an adult. He was advised that if he stayed, he would no longer be able to access special education services, but this was incorrect.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/parkland-shooter-asked-for-help-but-was-denied-before-shooting |title=Parkland Shooter Asked for Help, but Was Denied Before Shooting |first=Allison |last=Quinn |date=August 4, 2018 |work=[[The Daily Beast]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.local10.com/news/parkland-school-shooting/judge-says-parkland-school-shooters-education-records-can-be-released |title=School district mishandled Parkland shooter's access to special education, report says |first1=Andrea |last1=Torres |first2=Jeff |last2=Weinsier |date=August 4, 2018 |publisher=[[WPLG]] |location=Miami, Florida}}</ref> A few months later, he withdrew because of failing grades.

During the week of April 8â€“12, 2018, Broward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer included a three-page letter from a Minnesotan into the court record of the case. The letter was addressed to the judge and claimed that research into Cruz's past led the writer to believe that Cruz suffered from a [[developmental disability]] and that he was "fearful of other people and was threatened by bullies." The letter ended by claiming that Cruz appeared to be consumed by sadness and depression.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/12/us/nikolas-cruz-supporter-letter/index.html |title=Letter asks judge to show mercy on Parkland shooter |publisher=[[CNN]] |first1=Ray |last1=Sanchez |first2=Rosa |last2=Flores |access-date=April 16, 2018}}</ref>

The same week, a hearing was held to determine if Cruz was entitled to a public defender. His attorney, court-appointed public defender [[Howard Finkelstein]], asked the court to wait until the probate case involving Cruz's late mother's estate was concluded and Cruz's net worth could be determined, as Cruz would have only been entitled to a public defender had he been unable to afford a private attorney.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/11/us/nikolas-cruz-legal-fees-hearing/index.html |title=Nikolas Cruz, brother might have $1 million in bank, attorney says |first1=Eliott C. |last1=McLaughlin |first2=Rosa |last2=Flores |publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=April 16, 2018}}</ref> On April 24, 2019, a determination was made that Cruz and his half-brother Zachary would share the proceeds of a MetLife insurance policy valued at $864,929.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article229637214.html|title=Parkland shooter came into an $865K insurance policy.

According to the Broward County Sheriff's Office, Cruz attacked a jail officer on the night of November 13, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/8eb5491626b245038a34c14a8f1571c4|title=Sheriff: Parkland shooting suspect assaulted jail officer|last1=CURT|last2=ERSON|first3=Terry|last3=Spencer|date=November 14, 2018|website=AP NEWS|accessdate=June 6, 2019}}</ref> The following day, he was charged with aggravated assault on an officer, battery on an officer and use of an "electric or chemical weapon against an officer." The officer who was allegedly attacked by Cruz had asked him to "not drag his sandals on the ground" while he was walking in the jail's dayroom. It was claimed Cruz responded by "displaying his middle finger" and striking the officer in the face. He also grabbed the stun gun out of the deputy's holster. The weapon discharged during the brawl before the deputy regained control. Cruz appeared at an initial hearing on the assault charges, where bail was set at $200,000.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[USA Today]] |date=November 14, 2018 |first=Susan |last=Miller |title=Parkland suspect Nikolas Cruz charged with assaulting jail guard, grabbing stun gun |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/11/14/nikolas-cruz-parkland-charged-assaulting-jail-guard/2003165002/}}</ref>

== Aftermath ==
On May 30, 2018, prosecutors released three videos that they claimed Cruz had recorded on his cellphone before the shooting.

In early April, the school implemented several new safety rules and regulations.

On November 30, 2018, the ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' reported that Broward County Public Schools, which runs Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, had spent about $185,000 attempting to obscure its role in not preventing the massacre. The district also spent an undisclosed sum on legal opposition to the releasing of records related to the school's treatment of Nikolas Cruz while he was a student, and the school security procedures. A company named CEN received a $60,000 payment to review Cruz's school records and to investigate if the Broward County Public Schools followed the law in its handling of Cruz as a troubled student.

On the first anniversary of the shooting, the school opted to establish a voluntary attendance day. It organized a day of community service with early dismissal, so that the school was closed at the time of the attack. A police line was created to shelter those students who chose to attend. The large, planned project for the day was to replace the memorial with a permanent memorial garden.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20190214/parkland-anniversary-a-day-for-peace-as-msd-students-honor-dead-with-service-projects |title=Parkland anniversary: 'A day for peace' as MSD students honor dead with service projects |last=Ramadan |first=Lulu |website=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |access-date=February 14, 2019}}</ref> A planned moment of silence at 10:17 AM [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] was held, with support provided from grief counselors and therapy dogs.

A statement released by Peterson's lawyer before he was charged said that Peterson believed the shooting was happening outside the building.

At 2:27, at Building 12, he radioed, "Stay at least 500 feet away at this point." At an unspecified time, Peterson ordered: "Do not approach the 12 or 1300 building, stay at least 500 feet away".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ovalle |first1=David |last2=Rabin |first2=Charles |last3=Smiley |first3=David |last4=Teproff |first4=Carli |title=Disgraced Parkland deputy heard shots inside school building, told cops to stay away |url= http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article204226584.html |work=[[Miami Herald]] |accessdate=March 19, 2018}}</ref>
