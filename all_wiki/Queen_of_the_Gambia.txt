The Gambia was granted independence in 1965 under the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]'s [[Gambia Independence Act 1964]], which unified the [[Gambia Colony and Protectorate]] into an independent [[sovereign state]].

After two referenda on constitutional amendments, the [[Gambian republic referendum, 1965|first unsuccessful]] because it did not pass by the necessary two-thirds majority and the [[Gambian republic referendum, 1970|second successful]], The Gambia adopted a new constitution that abolished the monarchy on 24 April 1970.<ref name=maddex/> The Gambia became a [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|republic within the Commonwealth]], with the [[President of The Gambia]] as [[head of state]].<ref name=cuhaj/>

The Queen visited The Gambia on 3–5 December 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/RoyalVisits/Commonwealthvisitssince1952.aspx|title=Commonwealth visits since 1952|publisher=Royal Household|work=Official website of the British monarchy|accessdate=8 November 2015}}</ref>
