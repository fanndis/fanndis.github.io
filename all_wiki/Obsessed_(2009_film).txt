'''''Obsessed''''' is a 2009 American [[psychological thriller]] film directed by [[Steve Shill]] and written by [[David Loughery]]. Starring [[Idris Elba]], [[Beyoncé Knowles]], and [[Ali Larter]], the film tells the story of Lisa (Larter), an office temp who develops unrequited feelings for her boss, Derek Charles (Elba), and repeatedly attempts to seduce him. Derek's wife, Sharon (Beyoncé), learns of Lisa's obsessive behavior, and suspects an affair. ''Obsessed'' was inspired by the work of directors [[Roman Polanski]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and more specifically ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'' (1987), and its [[film score|score]] was written by [[James Dooley (composer)|James Dooley]]. Lisa and Sharon were dressed in contrasting styles to reinforce their conflicting characters. It was released in the United States on April 24, 2009, by [[Screen Gems]].

''Obsessed'' received generally negative reviews from critics, many of whom were disappointed in the absence of an explanation for Lisa's obsession with Derek. Others noted that the potential theme of interracial conflict between the Charles family, who are black, and Lisa, who is white, was unexplored. The film's storyline has drawn comparisons to that of ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'' (1987) – a recollection in which Elba and Beyoncé have the [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Anne Archer]] roles, respectively, while Larter is in [[Glenn Close]]'s – although film critics disliked the fact that Derek did not yield to Lisa's seduction. The fight scene finale between Sharon and Lisa, however, was commended by reviewers, and won the [[MTV Movie Award for Best Fight]]. ''Obsessed'' spent its first week atop the US box office, and grossed $73.8&nbsp;million from theaters, internationally.<ref name="BOM"/> [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] released the film on home video on August 4, 2009, in the US and has sold 1.3&nbsp;million DVDs, worth $21&nbsp;million of consumer spending.<ref name="DVDSales"/>

==Plot==
Derek Charles works for a finance company and is married to Sharon, with whom he has an infant son, Kyle. While Derek is at work, he befriends a white temporary worker, Lisa Sheridan, who, believing Derek was flirting with her, tries to seduce him. Although Derek repeatedly rejects her, Lisa continues to pursue him throughout the film, and makes sexual advances on him at the office Christmas party. At one point, she follows Derek to his car and [[exhibitionism|flashes]] him; he forces her out of his car. Derek intends to report Lisa to his firm's human resource management, but learns that she has quit her job. Thinking that Lisa has given up, Derek is annoyed when he receives flirtatious emails from her. Derek and his workmates visit a resort for a conference, where he spots and confronts Lisa, who spikes his drink. Incapacitated, Derek is helpless when Lisa follows him into his hotel room. He confronts Lisa again the following day, and hours later discovers her lying naked in his bed after attempting suicide, and calls for medical help.

After repeated attempts to reach Derek on his phone, Sharon finds him at the hospital and suspects that he and Lisa had an affair, as Lisa claims. Detective Monica Reese at first questions Derek's fidelity to Sharon as well, but soon becomes skeptical of Lisa's claims due to inconsistencies in her story. Refusing to believe Derek, Sharon kicks him out of their house, and he moves into a separate apartment. Months later, Derek and Sharon meet up each other for dinner and finally reconcile. During this dinner, Lisa tricks the babysitter Samantha into letting her in the house under the pretense of being one of Sharon's friends delivering a gift. When Derek and Sharon return home after dinner, they discover that Lisa has been in their house and kidnapped Kyle. Derek goes to his car with the intent to pursue Lisa, only to find Kyle is safely sitting in the back seat. He and Sharon immediately take Kyle to the hospital for a check-up. When Derek and Sharon return home, they find Lisa has trashed their bedroom and removed Sharon's face from their family portrait. Sharon leaves a threatening voice message on Lisa's phone, and she and Derek set up a home alarm system.

Lisa learns that Derek and Sharon will be going away from town for a few days, with Sharon leaving one afternoon and Derek the next day. While Sharon is on her way to pick up Kyle, she realizes she forgot to set the alarm system and returns home. Meanwhile, Lisa breaks into Derek and Sharon's house again and decorates the master bed with rose petals. While setting the alarm, Sharon hears Lisa in the bedroom. She confronts Lisa, who tries to convince her that Derek was having an affair with Lisa. Sharon tries to call the police, but Lisa stops her, and Sharon and Lisa engage in an altercation. Derek calls the home phone and Lisa answers; he later calls Detective Reese and they both head toward the house to stop Lisa. Meanwhile, Sharon chases Lisa to the attic and leads her to a weak spot in the attic floor, where she falls through. Seeing that Lisa is in mortal danger, Sharon reaches out in an tries to grab her and lift her up, but Lisa refuses and tries to pull Sharon down with her instead. Seeing that the floor is beginning to collapse, Sharon pries Lisa off of her arm. Lisa is injured upon falling on the chandelier which she hangs off on. The chandelier soon loosens, but Lisa falls onto the glass table below, and is killed when the chandelier falls from the ceiling and crushes her. Detective Reese arrives as Sharon comes out of the house; she later goes inside the house to investigate Lisa's actions. Derek arrives soon after Detective Reese; he and Sharon tearfully embrace with each other as the film comes to an end.

==Production==

===Background===
[[File:Earvin "Magic" Johnson on '07.jpg|thumb|right|[[NBA]] legend Earvin "Magic" Johnson served as an executive producer]]

The concept of ''Obsessed'' was thought up by Clint Culpepper, president of [[Screen Gems]], and was shared with [[David Loughery]], who then wrote the [[screenplay]], taking basic inspiration from the similar stalker thriller ''[[Fatal Attraction]]'' (1987). Producer [[William Packer (producer)|William Packer]] read the script and signed on; [[executive producer]]s for the film were Glenn S. Gainor, Jeff Graup, [[Magic Johnson|Earvin "Magic" Johnson]], Beyoncé, [[Mathew Knowles]], Damon Lee and Loughery, while [[Nicholas Stern (film producer)|Nicholas Stern]] and [[George Flynn (movie producer)|George Flynn]] served as co-producer and associate producer, respectively.<ref name="Anderson"/> Director [[Steve Shill]] signed on after reading the script and hearing that Beyoncé was on board.<ref name="See">{{cite news|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60YEgxlpR?url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/calgary-movies/obsessed-75421/ |url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/calgary-movies/obsessed-75421/ |archivedate=July 30, 2011 |title=Obsessed |work=[[Fast Forward Weekly]] |publisher=Great West Newspapers |url-status=dead }} Note: Click on "More info for movie geeks..."</ref> Part of the reason Elba joined in was that the black–white theme was ignored; "It's not mentioned in the film, it's never an issue, and I think that's phenomenal ...

===Casting and filming===
The [[casting director]]s for ''Obsessed'' were Ron Digman and Valorie Massalas.<ref name="Anderson"/> According to Packer, Elba and Saldana were the favorite actors for their respective lead roles; he stated that "they both brought the right amount of depth and sex appeal" to the film. He emphasized the need for actors "who were relatable and who can handle that type of human interplay that we have in the film."<ref name="bvon"/> Packer showed the film script to Beyoncé's [[talent agent]], who suggested that Beyoncé play the role of Sharon.

===Set and costumes===
[[File:Obsessed.jpg|thumb|left|The house used as the Charles' family home]]
Shill and cinematographer Ken Seng were inspired by [[Roman Polanski]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]] when [[Set construction|constructing the set]], and attempted to make it look both frightening and suburban. Shill stated, "It didn't look like typical Hollywood; it didn't look cosmetic."<ref name="See"/> The Charles' family home was set in a 1923 [[Altadena, California]] house, however the action scenes were shot on a separate purpose-built set. The set was customized from a house built for ''[[The Stepfather (2009 film)|The Stepfather]]'' (2009), which in turn was adapted from a block of apartments for ''[[Quarantine (2008 film)|Quarantine]]'' (2008). The Charles' living room had a ceiling {{convert|25|ft|m}} high, and a custom-built chandelier for the climactic ending of the film. According to Gainor, the house is symbolic of the family's aspirations, and is intentionally too large for the three occupants; he said, "It's a little awkward and a little bit eerie." The fight scene was filmed on a [[sound stage]] set, rather than in the house, for safety and practicability reasons.<ref name="See"/>

Costume designer Maya Lieberman attempted to contrast the costumes of Sharon and Lisa to reinforce the conflict between the two characters. She said, "With Ali, our discussion started with wanting really clean, classic and sharp lines, whereas Beyoncé's character [wore] more soft, more textural cashmeres and knits."<ref name="See"/> Sharon wore clothes designed by [[Zac Posen]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Jimmy Choo Ltd|Jimmy Choo]], [[Diane von Fürstenberg]], [[Valentino Garavani|Valentino]], [[Stella McCartney]] and [[Missoni]], while Lisa wore [[Gucci]], [[Dolce & Gabbana]] and [[Burberry]] outfits. Derek was dressed in Dolce & Gabbana and [[Versace]] suits with [[Thomas Pink]] shirts to create a "prestigious yet contemporary" look.<ref name="See"/>

Critics drew close comparisons between ''Obsessed'' and [[Adrian Lyne]]'s 1987 stalker thriller ''[[Fatal Attraction]]''.
