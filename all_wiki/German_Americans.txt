'''German Americans''' ({{lang-de|Deutschamerikaner}}, {{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏ̯tʃʔameʁiˌkaːnɐ|pron}}) are [[Americans]] who have full or partial [[Germans|German]] ancestry. With an estimated size of approximately 44.2 million in 2018, German Americans are the largest of the self-reported ancestry groups by the [[United States Census Bureau]] in its [[American Community Survey]].<ref name="American Community Survey"/> German Americans account for about one third of the total ethnic German population in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.en.bmi.bund.de/nn_148248/Internet/Content/Themen/Auslaender__Fluechtlinge__Asyl__Zuwanderung/DatenundFakten/Deutsche__Auslaender__mit__Migrationshintergrund__en.html|title=Germans and foreigners with an immigrant background|publisher=The Federal Ministry of the Interior of the Federal Republic of Germany|date=2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504094914/http://www.en.bmi.bund.de/nn_148248/Internet/Content/Themen/Auslaender__Fluechtlinge__Asyl__Zuwanderung/DatenundFakten/Deutsche__Auslaender__mit__Migrationshintergrund__en.html|archivedate=May 4, 2009|postscript=: 156 is the estimate which counts all people claiming ethnic German ancestry in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, and elsewhere.}}</ref><ref>"Ethnic Groups of Europe: An Encyclopedia" by Jeffrey Cole (2011), page 171.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://histclo.com/country/ger/reg/pop/gr-pop.html |title=Report on German population |publisher=Histclo.com |date=4 February 2010 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}</ref>

Very few of the [[List of states of the German Confederation|German states]] had colonies in the new world. In the 1670s, the first significant groups of German immigrants arrived in the [[British America|British colonies]], settling primarily in [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]]. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] continued in very large numbers during the 19th century, with eight million arrivals from Germany. Between 1820 and 1870, more than seven and a half million German immigrants came to the United States. 

There is a "German belt" that extends all the way across the United States, from eastern Pennsylvania to the Oregon coast. Pennsylvania has the largest population of German-Americans in the U.S. and is home to one of the group's original settlements, [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown (Philadelphia)]], founded in 1683 and the birthplace of the [[1688 Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery|American antislavery movement]] in 1688, as well as the revolutionary [[Battle of Germantown]]. The state of Pennsylvania has 3.5 million people of German ancestry.

They were pulled by the attractions of land and religious freedom, and pushed out of Germany by shortages of land and religious or [[political repression|political oppression]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert C.

The arrivals before 1850 were mostly farmers who sought out the most productive land, where their intensive farming techniques would pay off. After 1840, many came to cities, where "Germania"—German-speaking districts—soon emerged.<ref>Zane L.

The great majority of people with some German ancestry have become [[Americanization (immigration)|Americanized]]; fewer than 5% speak German. German-American societies abound, as do celebrations that are held throughout the country to celebrate German heritage of which the [[German-American Steuben Parade]] in [[New York City]] is one of the most well-known and is held every third Saturday in September. [[Oktoberfest celebrations#United States|Oktoberfest celebrations]] and the [[German-American Day]] are popular festivities. There are major annual events in cities with German heritage including [[Chicago]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[San Antonio]] and [[St. Louis]].

==History==
The Germans included many quite distinct subgroups with differing religious and cultural values.<ref>Paul Kleppner, '' The Third Electoral System, 1853-1892: Parties, Voters, and Political Cultures'' (1979) pp 147-58 maps out the political beliefs of key subgroups.</ref> Lutherans and Catholics typically opposed Yankee moralizing programs such as the prohibition of beer, and favored paternalistic families with the husband deciding the family position on public affairs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Belinda|title=Christian Clergy Response to Intimate Partner Violence: Attitudes, Training, Or Religious Views?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMDCCBmzEsIC&pg=PA55|year=2007|page=55|isbn=9780549564379}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Michael A.

Large numbers of Germans migrated from the 1680s to 1760s, with Pennsylvania the favored destination. They migrated to America for a variety of reasons.<ref name="First German-Americans" /> ''[[Human migration#Lee|Push factors]]'' involved worsening opportunities for farm ownership in central Europe, persecution of some religious groups, and military conscription; ''[[Human migration#Lee|pull factors]]'' were better economic conditions, especially the opportunity to own land, and religious freedom. Often immigrants paid for their passage by selling their labor for a period of years as [[indentured servant]]s.<ref>[http://www.faulkner.edu/academics/artsandsciences/socialandbehavioral/readings/hy/servitude.asp Gottlieb Mittleberger on Indentured Servitude] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201124624/http://www.faulkner.edu/academics/artsandsciences/socialandbehavioral/readings/hy/servitude.asp |date=2009-02-01 }}, Faulkner University</ref>

Large sections of [[Pennsylvania]], [[Upstate New York]], and the [[Shenandoah Germans|Shenandoah Valley]] of Virginia attracted Germans. Most were [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] or [[Calvinism|German Reformed]]; many belonged to small religious sects such as the [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] and [[Mennonite]]s. [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|German Catholics]] did not arrive in number until after the War of 1812.<ref name="Conzen">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Conzen|first=Kathleen|editor-last=Thernstrom|editor-first=Stephan|editor-link=Stephan Thernstrom|editor-last2=Orlov|editor-first2=Ann|editor-last3=Handlin|editor-first3=Oscar|editor-link3=Oscar Handlin|title=Germans|page=407|encyclopedia=Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups|url=https://archive.org/details/harvardencyclope00ther|year=1980|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|isbn=0674375122|oclc=1038430174}}</ref>

====Palatines====
In 1709, Protestant Germans from the Pfalz or [[Palatinate (region)|Palatine]] region of Germany escaped conditions of poverty, traveling first to Rotterdam and then to London. [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], helped them get to her colonies in America. The trip was long and difficult to survive because of the poor quality of food and water aboard ships and the infectious disease [[typhus]]. Many immigrants, particularly children, died before reaching America in June 1710.<ref name="Knittle">{{Citation|last=Knittle|first=Walter Allen|title=Early Eighteenth Century Palatine Emigration|publisher=Dorrance|location=Philadelphia|year=1937}}</ref>

The Palatine immigration of about 2100 people who survived was the largest single immigration to America in the colonial period. Most were first settled along the [[Hudson River]] in work camps, to pay off their passage. By 1711, seven villages had been established in New York on the [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]] manor. In 1723 Germans became the first Europeans allowed to buy land in the [[Mohawk Valley]] west of [[Little Falls (town), New York|Little Falls]]. One hundred homesteads were allocated in the Burnetsfield Patent. By 1750, the Germans occupied a strip some {{convert|12|mi|km}} long along both sides of the [[Mohawk River]]. The soil was excellent; some 500 houses were built, mostly of stone, and the region prospered in spite of Indian raids. [[Herkimer (town), New York|Herkimer]] was the best-known of the German settlements in a region long known as the "German Flats".<ref name="Knittle"/>

They kept to themselves, married their own, spoke German, attended Lutheran churches, and retained their own customs and foods. They emphasized farm ownership. Some mastered English to become conversant with local legal and business opportunities. They tolerated slavery (although few were rich enough to own a slave).<ref>Philip Otterness, ''Becoming German: The 1709 Palatine Migration to New York'' (2004)</ref>

The most famous of the early German Palatine immigrants was editor [[John Peter Zenger]], who led the fight in colonial New York City for freedom of the press in America. A later immigrant, [[John Jacob Astor]], who came from Baden after the Revolutionary War, became the richest man in America from his fur trading empire and real estate investments in New York.<ref>Axel Madsen, ''John Jacob Astor: America's First Multimillionaire'' (2001) [https://www.amazon.com/John-Jacob-Astor-Americas-Multimillionaire/dp/0471385034 excerpt]</ref>

====Louisiana====
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--only last paragraph is cited-->

[[John Law (economist)|John Law]] organized the first colonization of Louisiana with German immigrants. Of the over 5,000 Germans initially immigrating primarily from the [[Alsace|Alsace Region]] as few as 500 made up the first wave of immigrants to leave France en route to the Americas. Less than 150 of those first indentured German farmers made it to Louisiana and settled along what became known as the German Coast. With tenacity, determination and the leadership of D'arensburg these Germans felled trees, cleared land, and cultivated the soil with simple hand tools as draft animals were not available. The German coast settlers supplied the budding City of New Orleans with corn, rice, eggs. and meat for many years following.

The [[Mississippi Company]] settled thousands of German pioneers in [[France|French]] [[Louisiana]] during 1721. It encouraged Germans, particularly Germans of the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] region who had recently fallen under French rule, and the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] to immigrate. [[Alsace]] was sold to France within the greater context of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648).

The [[Jesuit]] [[Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix|Charlevoix]] traveled [[New France]] ([[Canada]] and Louisiana) in the early 1700s. His letter said "these 9,000 Germans, who were raised in the Palatinate (Alsace part of France) were in [[Arkansas]]. The Germans left Arkansas en masse. They went to [[New Orleans]] and demanded passage to Europe. The Mississippi Company gave the Germans rich lands on the right bank of the [[Mississippi River]] about {{convert|25|mi|km}} above New Orleans. The area is now known as 'the [[German Coast]]'."

A thriving population of Germans lived upriver from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], known as the [[German Coast]]. They were attracted to the area through pamphlets such as J. Hanno Deiler's "Louisiana: A Home for German Settlers".<ref name="J. Hanno Deiler">{{Citation|url=http://www.hnoc.org/collections/gerpath/gersect6.html|title=J.

====Southeast====
Two waves of German colonists in 1714 and 1717 founded a large colony in [[Virginia]] called [[Germanna]],<ref name="Germanna Foundation">{{Citation|url=http://www.germanna.org/history|title=Germanna History|accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref> located near modern-day [[Culpeper, Virginia]]. Virginia Lieutenant Governor [[Alexander Spotswood]], taking advantage of the [[headright system]], had bought land in present-day [[Spotsylvania County, Virginia|Spotsylvania]] and encouraged German immigration by advertising in [[Germany]] for [[miner]]s to move to Virginia and establish a mining industry in the colony. The name "Germanna", selected by Governor [[Alexander Spotswood]], reflected both the German immigrants who sailed across the Atlantic to Virginia and the British queen, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]], who was in power at the time of the first settlement at Germanna.

In [[North Carolina]], German [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravians]] living around [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] purchased nearly {{convert|100000|acre|km2|sigfig=1}} from [[Lord Granville]] (one of the British Lords Proprietor) in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] of [[North Carolina]] in 1753. They established German settlements on that tract, especially in the area around what is now [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]].<ref>{{cite book|asin=0806302925}}</ref> They also founded the transitional settlement of [[Bethabara, North Carolina]], translated as House of Passage, the first planned Moravian community in North Carolina, in 1759. Soon after, the German Moravians founded the town of [[Old Salem|Salem]] in 1766 (now a historical section in the center of Winston-Salem) and [[Salem College]] (an early female college) in 1772.

In the [[Georgia Colony]], Germans mainly from the [[Swabia]] region settled in Savannah, St. Simon's Island and [[Fort Frederica]] in the 1730s and 1740s. They were actively recruited by [[James Oglethorpe]] and quickly distinguished themselves through improved farming, advanced [[tabby (cement)]]-construction, and leading joint Lutheran-[[Anglicanism|Anglican]]-Reformed religious services for the colonists.

German immigrants also settled in other areas of the American South, including around the Dutch (Deutsch) Fork area of [[South Carolina]],<ref name="Conzen"/> and [[Texas]], especially in the [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] areas.

====New England====
Between 1742 and 1753, roughly 1,000 Germans settled in Broad Bay, Massachusetts (now [[Waldoboro, Maine]]). Many of the colonists fled to [[Boston]], [[Maine]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[North Carolina]] after their houses were burned and their neighbors killed or carried into captivity by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The Germans who remained found it difficult to survive on farming, and eventually turned to the shipping and fishing industries.<ref name="Faust">{{Citation|last=Faust|first=Albert Bernhardt|title=The German Element in the United States with Special Reference to Its Political, Moral, Social, and Educational Influence|publisher=Houghton-Mifflin|location=Boston|year=1909|title-link=The German Element in the United States}}</ref>

====Pennsylvania====
{{Main|Pennsylvania German}}

The tide of German immigration to [[Pennsylvania]] swelled between 1725 and 1775, with immigrants arriving as [[redemptioner]]s or indentured servants. By 1775, Germans constituted about one-third of the population of the state. German farmers were renowned for their highly productive animal husbandry and agricultural practices. Politically, they were generally inactive until 1740, when they joined a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]]-led coalition that took control of the legislature, which later supported the [[American Revolution]]. Despite this, many of the German settlers were [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalists]] during the Revolution, possibly because they feared their royal land grants would be taken away by a new republican government, or because of loyalty to a British German monarchy who had provided the opportunity to live in a liberal society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sciway3.net/clark/revolutionarywar/loyalists.html|title=Loyalists (Royalists, Tories) in South Carolina|website=Sciway3.net|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> The Germans, comprising [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]], [[Mennonite]]s, [[Amish]], and other sects, developed a rich religious life with a strong musical culture. Collectively, they came to be known as the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] (from ''Deutsch'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Hostetler|first= John A.|authorlink=John A. Hostetler|year= 1993|title=Amish Society|url=https://archive.org/details/amishsociety00host_0|url-access=registration|publisher= The [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|location= Baltimore|page= [https://archive.org/details/amishsociety00host_0/page/241 241]|isbn=}}</ref><ref>De Grauwe, Luc, "Emerging mother-tongues awareness in Dutch and German". In Linn & McLelland (eds). ''Standardization: Studies from the Germanic Languages''. p. 101, 104, passim.</ref>

Etymologically, the word Dutch originates from the Old High German word "diutisc" (from "diot" "people"), referring to the Germanic "language of the people" as opposed to Latin, the language of the learned (see also [[theodiscus]]). Eventually the word came to refer to people who speak a Germanic language, and only in the last couple centuries the people of the Netherlands. Other Germanic language variants for "deutsch/deitsch/dutch" are: Dutch "Duits" and "[[Diets]]", Yiddish "[[daytsh]]", Danish/Norwegian "tysk", or Swedish "[[Theodiscus#Etymology|tyska]]." The Japanese "doitzu" also derives from the aforementioned "Dutch" variations.

The [[Studebaker]] brothers, forefathers of the wagon and automobile makers, arrived in Pennsylvania in 1736 from the famous blade town of [[Solingen]]. With their skills, they made wagons that carried the frontiersmen westward; their cannons provided the [[Union Army]] with artillery in the [[American Civil War]], and their automobile company became one of the largest in America, although never eclipsing the "Big Three", and was a factor in the [[war effort]] and in the industrial foundations of the Army.<ref>Patrick Foster, ''Studebaker: The Complete History'' (2008)</ref>

{{Main|Germans in the American Revolution}}

Great Britain, whose [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] was also the [[Prince-elector|Elector]] of [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] in Germany, hired 18,000 [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessians]].  They were mercenary soldiers rented out by the rulers of several small German states such as Hesse to fight on the British side. Many were captured; they remained as prisoners during the war but some stayed and became U.S. citizens.<ref>Edward J.

The largest flow of German immigration to America occurred between 1820 and World War{{nbsp}}I, during which time nearly six million Germans immigrated to the United States. From 1840 to 1880, they were the largest group of immigrants. Following the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], a wave of political refugees fled to America, who became known as [[Forty-Eighters]]. They included professionals, journalists, and politicians. Prominent Forty-Eighters included [[Carl Schurz]] and [[Henry Villard]].<ref name="Wittke">{{Citation|last=Wittke|first=Carl|title=Refugees of Revolution|publisher=University of Pennsylvania press|location=Philadelphia|year=1952}}</ref>

"Latin farmer" or [[Latin Settlement]] is the designation of several settlements founded by some of the [[Dreissiger]] and other refugees from Europe after rebellions like the [[Frankfurter Wachensturm]] beginning in the 1830s—predominantly in Texas and Missouri, but also in other US states—in which German intellectuals ([[freethinkers]], {{lang-de|Freidenker}}, and [[Latinist]]s) met together to devote themselves to the [[German literature]], [[German philosophy|philosophy]], science, [[classical music]], and the [[Latin language]]. A prominent representative of this generation of immigrants was [[Gustav Koerner]] who lived most of the time in [[Belleville, Illinois]] until his death.

====Jewish Germans====
{{main|History of the Jews in the United States}}

A few [[German Jews]] came in [[History of the Jews in Colonial America|the colonial era]]. The largest numbers arrived after 1820, especially in the mid-19th century.<ref>Naomi Wiener Cohen, ''Encounter with Emancipation: The German Jews in the United States, 1830-1914'' (Varda Books, 2001).</ref> They spread across the North and South (and California, where [[Levi Strauss]] arrived in 1853). They formed small German-Jewish communities in cities and towns. They typically were local and regional merchants selling clothing; others were livestock dealers, agricultural commodity traders, bankers, and operators of local businesses. [[Henry Lehman]], who founded [[Lehman Brothers]] in Alabama, was a particularly prominent example of such a German-Jewish immigrant. They formed [[Reform Judaism|Reform synagogues]]<ref>Zev Eleff, ''Who Rules the Synagogue?: Religious Authority and the Formation of American Judaism'' (Oxford Up, 2016).</ref> and sponsored numerous local and national philanthropic organizations, such as [[B'nai B'rith]].<ref>Cornelia Wilhelm, ''The Independent Orders of B'nai B'rith and True Sisters: Pioneers of a New Jewish Identity, 1843-1914'' (2011).</ref> This German-speaking group is quite distinct from the Yiddish-speaking East-European Jews who arrived in much larger numbers starting in the late 19th century and concentrated in New York.

====Northeastern cities====
{{Further|Germans in Syracuse, New York|History of the Germans in Baltimore}}

The port cities of [[New York City|New York]], and [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|Baltimore]] had large populations. As did [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].

====Cities of the Midwest====
{{Further|Germans in Chicago|Germans in Milwaukee|Germans in Omaha, Nebraska|History of the Germans in Louisville}}

Cities along the Great Lakes, the Ohio River, and the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers attracted a large German element. The [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] cities of [[Milwaukee]], [[Cincinnati]], [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]] were favored destinations of German immigrants. The [[Northern Kentucky]] and [[History of the Germans in Louisville|Louisville]] area along the [[Ohio River]] was also a favored destination. By 1900, the populations of the cities of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Milwaukee]], and [[Cincinnati]] were all more than 40% German American. [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] and [[Davenport, Iowa]] had even larger proportions, as did [[Omaha]], Nebraska, where the proportion of German Americans was 57% in 1910. In many other cities of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], such as [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], German Americans were at least 30% of the population.<ref name="Faust"/><ref>Census data from Bureau of the Census, ''Thirteenth census of the United States taken in the year 1910'' (1913)</ref> By 1850 there were 5,000 Germans, mostly [[Schwabian]]s living in, and around, [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stephenson|first1=Orlando|title=Ann Arbor the First Hundred Years|date=1927|publisher=Ann Arbor Chamber of Commerce|location=Ann Arbor|page=81|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=moaatxt;idno=3933400.0001.001|accessdate=25 February 2016|format=Hardcover}}</ref>

Many concentrations acquired distinctive names suggesting their heritage, such as the "[[Over-the-Rhine]]" district in Cincinnati, "[[Dutchtown, St. Louis|Dutchtown]]" in South St Louis, and "[[German Village]]" in Columbus, Ohio.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://germanvillage.com/index.php|title=German Village Society|accessdate=19 November 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509124022/http://www.germanvillage.com/index.php|archivedate=9 May 2008}}</ref>

A particularly attractive destination was [[Milwaukee]], and came to be known as "the German [[Athens]]". Radical Germans trained in politics in the old country dominated the city's [[Social Democratic Party (United States)|Socialists]]. Skilled workers dominated many crafts, while entrepreneurs created the brewing industry; the most famous brands included [[Pabst Brewing Company|Pabst]], [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company|Schlitz]], [[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]], and [[Valentin Blatz Brewing Company|Blatz]].<ref>Trudy Knauss Paradis, et al. ''German Milwaukee'' (2006)</ref>

Whereas half of German immigrants settled in cities, the other half established farms in the [[Midwest]]. From Ohio to the Plains states, a heavy presence persists in rural areas into the 21st century.<ref name="Conzen"/><ref>Richard Sisson, ed. ''The American Midwest'' (2007), p. 208; Gross (1996); Johnson (1951).</ref>

====Deep South====
{{Further|Germans in Alabama}}

Few German immigrants settled in the [[Deep South]], apart from [[New Orleans]], the [[German Coast]], and [[Texas]].<ref name="German Settlers in Louisiana and New Orleans">{{Citation|url=http://www.hnoc.org/collections/gerpath/gersect1.htm|title=German Settlers in Louisiana and New Orleans|accessdate=2007-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204103934/http://www.hnoc.org/collections/gerpath/gersect1.htm|archive-date=2008-12-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Texas====
{{Main|German Texan}}
[[File:WahrenbergerHouseAustinTX.JPG|thumb|The [[Wahrenberger House]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] served as a German-American school.<ref name="UTGermanAm">

Texas attracted many Germans who entered through [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] and [[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]], both those who came to farm, and later immigrants who more rapidly took industrial jobs in cities such as Houston. As in [[Milwaukee]], Germans in Houston built the brewing industry. By the 1920s, the first generation of college-educated German Americans were moving into the chemical and oil industries.<ref name="Conzen"/>

Texas had about 20,000 German Americans in the 1850s. They did not form a uniform bloc, but were highly diverse and drew from geographic areas and all sectors of European society, except that very few aristocrats or upper middle class businessmen arrived. In this regard, Texas Germania was a microcosm of the Germania nationwide.

<blockquote>The Germans who settled Texas were diverse in many ways. They included peasant farmers and intellectuals; Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and atheists; Prussians, Saxons, and Hessians; abolitionists and slave owners; farmers and townsfolk; frugal, honest folk and ax murderers. They differed in dialect, customs, and physical features. A majority had been farmers in Germany, and most arrived seeking economic opportunities. A few dissident intellectuals fleeing the 1848 revolutions sought political freedom, but few, save perhaps the Wends, went for religious freedom. The German settlements in Texas reflected their diversity. Even in the confined area of the Hill Country, each valley offered a different kind of German. The Llano valley had stern, teetotaling German Methodists, who renounced dancing and fraternal organizations; the Pedernales valley had fun-loving, hardworking Lutherans and Catholics who enjoyed drinking and dancing; and the Guadalupe valley had freethinking Germans descended from intellectual political refugees. The scattered German ethnic islands were also diverse. These small enclaves included Lindsay in Cooke County, largely Westphalian Catholic; Waka in Ochiltree County, Midwestern Mennonite; Hurnville in Clay County, Russian German Baptist; and Lockett in Wilbarger County, Wendish Lutheran.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/png02 |title=GERMANS |work=Handbook of Texas Online|date=2010-06-15 }}</ref></blockquote>

====Germans from Russia====
{{see also|Volga Germans|Russian Mennonite}}
[[File:Volga-Germans-US.jpg|thumb|left|Temporary quarters for [[Volga Germans]] in central Kansas, 1875]]

[[Germans from Russia]] were the most traditional of German-speaking arrivals.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} They were Germans who had lived for generations throughout the [[Russian Empire]], but especially along the [[Volga River]] in Russia and near the [[Crimea]]. Their ancestors had come from all over the German-speaking world, invited by [[Catherine the Great]] in 1762 and 1763 to settle and introduce more advanced German agriculture methods to rural Russia. They had been promised by the manifesto of their settlement the ability to practice their respective Christian denominations, retain their culture and language, and retain immunity from conscription for them and their descendants. As time passed, the Russian monarchy gradually eroded the ethnic German population's relative autonomy. Conscription eventually was reinstated; this was especially harmful to the Mennonites, who practice pacifism. Throughout the 19th century, pressure increased from the Russian government to culturally assimilate. Many Germans from Russia found it necessary to emigrate to avoid conscription and preserve their culture. About 100,000 immigrated by 1900, settling primarily in the Dakotas, Kansas and Nebraska. The southern central part of North Dakota was known as "the German-Russian triangle". A smaller number moved farther west, finding employment as ranchers and cowboys.

Negatively influenced by the violation of their rights and cultural persecution by the [[Tsar]], the Germans from Russia who settled in the northern [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] saw themselves a downtrodden ethnic group separate from Russian Americans and having an entirely different experience from the German Americans who had emigrated from German lands; they settled in tight-knit communities who retained their German language and culture. They raised large families, built German-style churches, buried their dead in distinctive cemeteries using cast iron grave markers, and sang German hymns. Many farmers specialized in sugar beets—still a major crop in the upper Great Plains. During World War{{nbsp}}I, their identity was challenged by [[anti-German sentiment]]. By the end of World War{{nbsp}}II, the German language, which had always been used with English for public and official matters, was in serious decline. Today, German is preserved mainly through singing groups and recipes, with the Germans from Russia in the northern Great Plains states speaking predominantly English. German remains the second most spoken language in North and South Dakota, and Germans from Russia often use [[loanword]]s, such as ''Kuchen'' for cake. Despite the loss of their language, the ethnic group remains distinct, and has left a lasting impression on the American West.<ref>Elwyn B. Robinson, ''History of North Dakota'' (1966) pp. 285–87, 557; Gordon L. Iseminger, "Are We Germans, or Russians, or Americans?

Musician [[Lawrence Welk]] (1903-1992) became an iconic figure in the German-Russian community of the northern Great Plains—his success story personified the American dream.<ref>Timothy J.

====Civil War====
{{main|German Americans in the American Civil War}}

Sentiment among German Americans was largely anti-slavery, especially among Forty-Eighters.<ref name="Wittke" /> Notable Forty-Eighter [[Hermann Raster]] wrote passionately against slavery and was very pro-Lincoln. Raster published anti-slavery pamphlets and was the editor of the most influential German language newspaper in America at the time.<ref>"Inventory of the Hermann Raster Papers". The Newberry Library.</ref> He helped secure the votes of German-Americans across the United States for Abraham Lincoln. When Raster died the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' published an article regarding his service as a correspondent for America to the German states saying, "His writings during and after the Civil War did more to create understanding and appreciation of the American situation in Germany and to float U.S. bonds in Europe than the combined efforts of all the U.S. ministers and consuls."<ref>"Honor Herman Raster."

[[File:Germans1900.jpg|thumb|The German vote in 1900 was in doubt; they opposed the "repudiation" policy of [[William Jennings Bryan|Bryan]] (right poster), but also disliked the overseas expansion [[William McKinley|McKinley]] had delivered (left poster)]]

Although only one in four Germans fought in all-German regiments, they created the public image of the German soldier. Pennsylvania fielded five German regiments, New York eleven, and Ohio six.<ref name="Keller" />

====Farmers====
Western railroads, with large land grants available to attract farmers, set up agencies in Hamburg and other German cities, promising cheap transportation, and sales of farmland on easy terms. For example, the Santa Fe railroad hired its own commissioner for immigration, and sold over {{convert|300,000|acre|km2}} to German-speaking farmers.<ref>C. B. Schmidt, "Reminiscences of Foreign Immigration Work for Kansas," ''Kansas Historical Collections, 1905–1906'' 9 (1906): 485–97; J. Neale Carman, ed. and trans., "German Settlements Along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway," ''[[Kansas Historical Quarterly]]'' 28 (Autumn 1962): 310–16; cited in Turk, "Germans in Kansas," (2005) p 57.</ref>

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the German Americans showed a high interest in becoming farmers, and keeping their children and grandchildren on the land. While they needed profits to stay in operation, they used profits as a tool "to maintain continuity of the family".<ref>Sonya Salamon, ''Prairie Patrimony: Family, Farming, and Community in the Midwest'' (U. of North Carolina Press, 1992) pp. 53, 101</ref> They used risk averse strategies, and carefully planned their inheritances to keep the land in the family. Their communities showed smaller average farm size, greater equality, less absentee ownership and greater geographic persistence. As one farmer explained, "To protect your family has turned out to be the same thing as protecting your land."<ref>Salamon, ''Prairie Patrimony'' p 101</ref>

Germany was a large country with many diverse subregions which contributed immigrants. Dubuque was the base of the ''Ostfriesische Nachrichten'' ("East Fresian News") from 1881 to 1971. It connected the 20,000 immigrants from East Friesland (Ostfriesland), Germany, to each other across the Midwest, and to their old homeland. In Germany East Friesland was often a topic of ridicule regarding backward rustics, but editor Leupke Hündling shrewdly combined stories of proud memories of Ostfriesland. The editor enlisted a network of local correspondents. By mixing local American and local German news, letters, poetry, fiction, and dialogue, the German-language newspaper allowed immigrants to honor their origins and celebrate their new life as highly prosperous farmers with much larger farms than were possible back in impoverished Ostfriesland. During the world wars, when Germania came under heavy attack, the paper stressed its humanitarian role, mobilizing readers to help the people of East Friesland with relief funds. Younger generations could usually speak German but not read it, so the subscription based dwindled away as the target audience Americanized itself.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 27501458|title = Heimat in the Heartland: The Significance of an Ethnic Newspaper|journal = Journal of American Ethnic History|volume = 23|issue = 3|pages = 78–98|last1 = Lindaman|first1 = Matthew|year = 2004}}</ref>

====Politics====
Relatively few German Americans held office, but the men voted once they became citizens. In general during the [[Third party System]] (1850s–1890s), the Protestants and Jews leaned toward the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] and the Catholics were strongly [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]. When [[prohibition]] was on the ballot, the Germans voted solidly against it. They strongly distrusted moralistic crusaders, whom they called "Puritans", including the temperance reformers and many [[Populist Party (United States)|Populists]]. The German community strongly opposed [[Free Silver]], and voted heavily against crusader [[William Jennings Bryan]] in 1896. In 1900, many German Democrats returned to their party and voted for Bryan, perhaps because of President [[William McKinley]]'s foreign policy.<ref name="Jensen1971">{{cite book|author=Richard J. Jensen|title=The Winning of the Midwest: Social and Political Conflict, 1888-1896|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpCgCNZwpvoC&q=McKinley%27s+inclusive+appeal|year=1971|publisher=Richard Jensen|isbn=978-0-226-39825-9|page=292}}</ref>

At the local level, historians have explored the changing voting behavior of the German-American community and one of its major strongholds, St. Louis, Missouri. The German Americans had voted 80 percent for Lincoln in 1860, and strongly supported the war effort. They were a bastion of the Republican Party in St. Louis and nearby immigrant strongholds in Missouri and southern Illinois. The German Americans were angered by a proposed Missouri state constitution that discriminated against Catholics and freethinkers. The requirement of a special loyalty oath for priests and ministers was troublesome. Despite their strong opposition the constitution was ratified in 1865. Racial tensions with the blacks began to emerge, especially in terms of competition for unskilled labor jobs. Germania was nervous about black suffrage in 1868, fearing that blacks would support puritanical laws, especially regarding the prohibition of beer gardens on Sundays. The tensions split off a large German element in 1872, led by Carl Schurz. They supported the Liberal Republican party led by [[Benjamin Gratz Brown]] for governor in 1870 and [[Horace Greeley]] for president in 1872.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 27501880|title = German Americans, African Americans, and the Republican Party in St. Louis, 1865-1872|journal = Journal of American Ethnic History|volume = 28|issue = 1|pages = 34–51|last1 = Anderson|first1 = Kristen L.|year = 2008}}</ref>

Many Germans in late 19th century cities were communists; Germans played a significant role in the labor union movement.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dorothee Schneider|title=Trade Unions and Community: The German Working Class in New York City, 1870-1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATL_3v4_PkwC&pg=PA36|year=1994|page=36|isbn=9780252020575}}</ref><ref>Hartmut Keil, and John B.

====Intellectuals====
[[File:Hugo Munsterberg.jpg|thumb|Hugo Münsterberg, Harvard professor of psychology]]

[[Hugo Münsterberg]] (1863–1916), a German psychologist, moved to Harvard in the 1890s and became a leader in the new profession. He was president of the American Psychological Association in 1898, and the [[American Philosophical Association]] in 1908, and played a major role in many other American and international organizations.<ref>Jutta Spillmann, and Lothar Spillmann.

[[Arthur Preuss]] (1871–1934) was a leading journalist, and theologian. A layman in St Louis. His ''Fortnightly Review'' (in English) was a major conservative voice read closely by church leaders and intellectuals from 1894 until 1934. He was intensely loyal to the Vatican. Preuss upheld the German Catholic community, denounced the "Americanism" heresy, promoted the [[Catholic University of America]], and anguished over the anti-German America hysteria during World War{{nbsp}}I. He provided lengthy commentary regarding the National Catholic Welfare Conference, the anti-Catholic factor in the presidential campaign of 1928, the hardships of the Great Depression, and the liberalism of the New Deal.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 25154032|title = Arthur Preuss, German-Catholic Exile in America|journal = U.S. Catholic Historian|volume = 12|issue = 3|pages = 41–62|last1 = Conley|first1 = Rory T.|year = 1994}}</ref><ref>Rory T.

====World War I anti-German sentiment====
{{see also|American entry into World War I|Internment of German Americans}}

During World War I (1914–18, American involvement 1917-18), German Americans were often accused of being too sympathetic to Imperial Germany. Former president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] denounced "[[hyphenated American]]ism", insisting that dual loyalties were impossible in wartime. A small minority came out for Germany, such as [[H. L. Mencken]]. Similarly, Harvard psychology professor [[Hugo Münsterberg]] dropped his efforts to mediate between America and Germany, and threw his efforts behind the German cause.<ref>Jutta Spillmann and Lothar Spillmann.

In the aftermath of World War II, millions of [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|ethnic Germans were forcibly expelled]] from their homes within the redrawn borders of Central and Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia. Most resettled in Germany, but others came as refugees to the United States in the late 1940s, and established cultural centers in their new homes. Some [[Danube Swabians]], for instance, [[ethnic Germans]] who had maintained language and customs after settlement in Hungary, later Yugoslavia (now [[Serbia]]), immigrated to the U.S. after the war.

After 1970, anti-German sentiment aroused by World War II faded away.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.germany.info/relaunch/politics/new/pol_German_US_Survey_4_2007.html|title=German Missions in the United States - Home|website=Germany.info|accessdate=17 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904225106/http://www.germany.info/relaunch/politics/new/pol_German_US_Survey_4_2007.html|archive-date=4 September 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Today, German Americans who immigrated after World War{{nbsp}}II share the same characteristics as any other Western European immigrant group in the U.S. They are mostly professionals and academics who have come for professional reasons.

==Demographics==
[[File:Distribution of Americans claiming German Ancestry by county in 2018.png|thumb|Distribution of Americans claiming German Ancestry by county in 2018]]

States with the highest proportions of German Americans tend to be those of the upper Midwest, including [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]], [[Nebraska]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[the Dakotas]]; all at over 30%.<ref name="American Community Survey"></ref>

Of the four major US regions, German was the most-reported ancestry in the [[Midwest]], second in the [[Western United States|West]], and third in both the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and the [[Southern United States|South]]. German was the top reported ancestry in 23 states, and it was one of the top five reported ancestries in every state except [[Maine]] and [[Rhode Island]].<ref name = "American Community Survey"></ref>

The Germans worked hard to maintain and cultivate their language, especially through newspapers and classes in elementary and high schools. German Americans in many cities, such as [[Milwaukee]], brought their strong support of education, establishing German-language schools and teacher training seminaries (''Töchter-Institut'') to prepare students and teachers in German language training. By the late 19th century, the Germania Publishing Company was established in Milwaukee, a publisher of books, magazines, and newspapers in German.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/~margo/sympapers/Ortlepp.htm|title=Deutsch-Athen Revisited{{nbsp}}...|website=Uwm.edu|accessdate=28 August 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207173929/http://www.uwm.edu/~margo/sympapers/Ortlepp.htm|archivedate=7 December 2008}}</ref>

"Germania" was the common term for German American neighborhoods and their organizations.<ref>Noel Iverson, ''Germania, U.S.A.'' (1966).</ref> ''Deutschtum'' was the term for transplanted German nationalism, both culturally and politically. Between 1875 and 1915, the German American population in the United States doubled, and many of its members insisted on maintaining their culture. German was used in local schools and churches, while numerous ''Vereine'', associations dedicated to literature, humor, gymnastics, and singing, sprang up in German American communities. German Americans tended to support the German government's actions, and, even after the United States entered World War{{nbsp}}I, they often voted for antidraft and antiwar candidates. 'Deutschtum' in the United States disintegrated after 1918.<ref>Andrew Yox, "The German-American Community as a Nationality, 1880-1940", ''Yearbook of German-American Studies'' 2001 36: 181-193; Kazal (2004)</ref>

===Music===
Beginning in 1741, the German-speaking [[Moravian Church]] Settlements of [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania|Nazareth]] and [[Lititz, Pennsylvania|Lititz]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Wachovia, North Carolina|Wachovia]] in North Carolina had highly developed musical cultures. Choral music, Brass and String Music and Congregational singing were highly cultivated. The Moravian Church produced many composers and musicians. [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s ''Creation'' had its American debut in Bethlehem in the early 19th century.

The spiritual beliefs of Johann Conrad Beissel (1690–1768) and the Ephrata Cloister—such as the asceticism and mysticism of this Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, group - are reflected in Beissel's treatises on music and hymns, which have been considered the beginning of America's musical heritage.<ref>Lucile E. Hackett, "Johann Conrad Beissel: Early German-American Mystic and Musician", ''Studies in Puritan American Spirituality'' 1995 5: 95–121</ref>

In most major cities, Germans took the lead in creating a musical culture, with popular bands, singing societies, operas and symphonic orchestras.<ref>Philip V. Bohlman ([[Philip Bohlman]]) and [[Otto Holzapfel]], eds. ''Land without Nightingales: Music in the Making of German-America.'' (U. of Wisconsin Press, 2002)</ref>

A small city, [[Wheeling, West Virginia]] could boast of 11 singing societies—Maennerchor, Harmonie, Liedertafel, Beethoven, Concordia, Liederkranz, Germania, Teutonia, Harmonie-Maennerchor, Arion, and Mozart. The first began in 1855; the last folded in 1961. An important aspect of Wheeling social life, these societies reflected various social classes and enjoyed great popularity until anti-German sentiments during World War{{nbsp}}I and changing social values dealt them a death blow.<ref>Edward C. Wolf, "Wheeling's German Singing Societies", ''West Virginia History'' 1980–1981 42(1–2): 1–56</ref>

The Liederkranz, a German-American music society, played an important role in the integration of the German community into the life of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Started in 1848, the organization was strengthened by the arrival of German liberals after the failure of the revolution of that year. By the mid-1850s the Germans formed one-third of Louisville's population and faced nativist hostility organized in the Know-Nothing movement. Violent demonstrations forced the chorus to suppress publicity of its performances that included works by composer Richard Wagner. The Liederkranz suspended operations during the Civil War, but afterward grew rapidly, and was able to build a large auditorium by 1873. An audience of 8,000 that attended a performance in 1877 demonstrated that the Germans were an accepted part of Louisville life.<ref>Erna Ottl Gwinn, "The Liederkranz in Louisville, 1848–1877", ''Filson Club History Quarterly'' 1975 49(3): 276–290,</ref>

The Imperial government in Berlin promoted German culture in the U.S., especially music. A steady influx of German-born conductors, including Arthur Nikisch and Karl Muck, spurred the reception of German music in the United States, while German musicians seized on Victorian Americans' growing concern with 'emotion'. The performance of pieces such as Beethoven's ''Ninth Symphony'' established German serious music as the superior language of feeling.<ref>Jessica C. E. Gienow-Hecht, "Trumpeting down the Walls of Jericho: The Politics of Art, Music and Emotion in German-American Relations, 1870–1920", ''Journal of Social History'' 2003 36(3): 585–613,</ref>

===Turners===
[[Turners|Turner societies]] in the United States were first organized during the mid-19th century so German American immigrants could visit with one another and become involved in social and sports activities. The National Turnerbund, the head organization of the Turnvereine, started drilling members as in militia units in 1854. Nearly half of all Turners fought in the Civil War, mostly on the Union side, and a special group served as bodyguards for President Lincoln.

By the 1890s, Turners numbered nearly 65,000. At the turn of the 21st century, with the ethnic identity of European Americans in flux and Americanization a key element of immigrant life, there were few Turner groups, athletic events were limited, and non-Germans were members. A survey of surviving groups and members reflects these radical changes in the role of Turner societies and their marginalization in 21st-century American society, as younger German Americans tended not to belong, even in strongholds of German heritage in the Midwest.<ref>Annette R. Hofmann, "Transformation and Americanization: The American Turners and Their New Identity", ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 2002 19(1): 91-118</ref>

===Media===
{{main|German American journalism}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-005795, Deutsche Zeitungen in Nordamerika.jpg|thumb|German newspapers in North America, 1922]]

As for any immigrant population, the development of a foreign-language press helped immigrants more easily learn about their new home, maintain connections to their native land, and unite immigrant communities.<ref>Carl Wittke, ''The German-Language Press in America'' (1957)</ref> By the late 19th century, Germania published over 800 regular publications. The most prestigious daily newspapers, such as the ''[[New Yorker Staats-Zeitung]]'', the ''[[Anzeiger des Westens]]'' in St. Louis, and the ''[[Illinois Staats-Zeitung]]'' in Chicago, promoted middle-class values and encouraged German ethnic loyalty among their readership.<ref>Peter Conolly-Smith, "Transforming an Ethnic Readership Through "Word and Image": William Randolph Hearst's Deutsches Journal and New York's German-Language Press, 1895–1918", Volume 19, Number 1, 2009 in [[Project MUSE]]; Peter Conolly-Smith, ''Translating America: An Ethnic Press Visualizes Popular American Culture, 1895–1918'' (2004); Carl Wittke, ''The German-Language Press in America'' (1957).</ref> The Germans were proud of their language, supported many German-language public and private schools, and conducted their church services in German.<ref>Richard Jensen, ''The Winning of the Midwest: Social and Political Conflict, 1888–1896'' (1971) ch. 5</ref> They published at least two-thirds of all foreign language newspapers in the U.S. The papers were owned and operated in the U.S., with no control from Germany. As Wittke emphasizes, press. it was "essentially an American press published in a foreign tongue". The papers reported on major political and diplomatic events involving Germany, with pride but from the viewpoint of its American readers.<ref>Wittke, ''The German-Language Press in America.'' p. 6</ref><ref>Shore, "Introduction". in ''The German-American Radical Press''.</ref> For example, during the latter half of the 19th century, at least 176 different German-language publications began operations in the city of Cincinnati alone. Many of these publications folded within a year, while a select few, such as the ''[[Cincinnati Freie Presse]]'', lasted nearly a century.<ref>Arndt, ''The German Language Press of the Americas''</ref> Other cities experienced similar turnover among immigrant publications, especially from opinion press, which published little news and focused instead on editorial commentary.<ref>Wittke, ''The German-Language Press in America''</ref>

By the end of the 19th century, there were over 800 German-language publications in the United States.<ref>La Verne Rippley, ''The German Americans'', Lanham, Maryland: University Press of America, 1984, p. 164.</ref> German immigration was on the decline, and with subsequent generations integrating into English-speaking society, the German language press began to struggle.<ref name="Dobbert, G.A 1914">Dobbert, G.A. "German-Americans between New and Old Fatherland, 1870-1914." ''American Quarterly''. 19.4 (1967): 663-680.</ref> The periodicals that managed to survive in immigrant communities faced an additional challenge with [[anti-German sentiment]] during World War{{nbsp}}I<ref>Shell, Marc. "Hyphens: Between Deitsch and American." Multilingual America. Ed.. Werner Sollors. New York City: New York University Press, 1998.</ref> and with the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage]] and [[Sedition Act of 1918|Sedition Acts]], which authorized censorship of foreign language newspapers.<ref>Thomas Adam (Ed.), ''Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History'', Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 319.</ref> [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] also had a destabilizing impact on the German immigrant communities upon which the German-language publications relied.<ref name="Dobbert, G.A 1914"/> By 1920, there were only 278 German language publications remaining in the country.<ref>Rippley, p. 166.</ref> After 1945, only a few publications have been started. One example is [[Hiwwe wie Driwwe]] (Kutztown, PA), the nation's only [[Pennsylvania German]] newspaper, which was established in 1997.

===Athletics===
Germans brought organized gymnastics to America, and were strong supporters of sports programs. They used sport both to promote ethnic identity and pride and to facilitate integration into American society. Beginning in the mid-19th century, the [[Turners|Turner]] movement offered exercise and sports programs, while also providing a social haven for the thousands of new German immigrants arriving in the United States each year. Another highly successful German sports organization was the [[Buffalo Germans]] basketball team, winners of 762 games (against only 85 losses) in the early years of the 20th century. These examples, and others, reflect the evolving place of sport in the assimilation and socialization of much of the German-American population.<ref>Annette R. Hofmann, "Between Ethnic Separation and Assimilation: German Immigrants and Their Athletic Endeavours in Their New American Home Country", ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 2008 25(8): 993-1009,</ref>

===Religion===
[[File:US census map of Lutheran churches - 1850.jpg|thumb|This 1850 census map shows the Lutheran population. Nearly all were German, since few Scandinavians had arrived yet.]]

German immigrants who arrived before the 19th century tended to have been members of the Evangelical Lutheran Churches in Germany, and created the Lutheran Synods of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New York. The largest Lutheran denominations in the U.S. today—the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]], and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]—are all descended from churches started by German immigrants among others. [[Calvinist]] Germans founded the [[Reformed Church in the United States]] (especially in New York and Pennsylvania), and the [[Evangelical Synod of North America]] (strongest in the Midwest), which is now part of the [[United Church of Christ]]. Many immigrants joined different churches from those that existed in Germany. Protestants often joined the [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]] church.<ref name="Conzen"/> In the 1740s, [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf|Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf]] tried to unite all the German-speaking Christians—(Lutheran, Reformed, and Separatists)—into one "Church of God in the Spirit". The [[Moravian Church]] in America is one of the results of this effort, as are the many "Union" churches in rural Pennsylvania.

Before 1800, communities of [[Amish]], [[Mennonite]]s, [[Schwarzenau Brethren]] and [[Moravian Church#Missions|Moravians]] had formed and are still in existence today. The Old Order Amish and a majority of the [[Old Order Mennonite]]s still speak dialects of German, including Pennsylvania German, informally known as [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]. The Amish, who were originally from southern Germany and Switzerland, arrived in Pennsylvania during the early 18th century. Amish immigration to the United States reached its peak between the years 1727 and 1770. Religious freedom was perhaps the most pressing cause for Amish immigration to Pennsylvania, which became known as a haven for persecuted religious groups.<ref name="The Amish">{{Citation|url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/amish.html|title=The Amish|accessdate=2006-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107190410/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/amish.html|archive-date=2006-11-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Hutterites are another example of a group of German Americans who continue a lifestyle similar to that of their ancestors. Like the Amish, they fled persecution for their religious beliefs, and came to the United States between 1874 and 1879. Today, Hutterites mostly reside in [[Montana]], [[the Dakotas]], and [[Minnesota]], and the western provinces of Canada. Hutterites continue to speak [[Hutterite German]]. Most are able to understand Standard German in addition to their dialect.<ref name="National Geographic, the Hutterites">{{Citation |last=Allard |first=William Albert |year=2006 |title=Hutterite Sojourn |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> The German speaking [[Russian Mennonites|"Russian" Mennonites]] migrated during the same time as the Hutterites, but assimilated relatively quickly in the United States, whereas groups of "Russian" Mennonites in Canada resisted assimilation.<ref>Donald B. Kraybill and Nelson Hostetter: ''Anabaptist World USA'', 2001, Scottdale, PA, and Waterloo, ON, page 115.</ref>

Immigrants from Germany in the mid-to-late-19th century brought many different religions with them. The most numerous were Lutheran or [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]], although the Lutherans were themselves split among different groups. The more conservative Lutherans comprised the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. Other Lutherans formed various synods, most of which merged with Scandinavian-based synods in 1988, forming the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.<ref>{{Citation|last=Almen|first=Lowell|title=One Great Cloud of Witnesses|publisher=Augsburg Fortress|location=Minneapolis|year=1997}}</ref> [[Catholic Germans]] started immigrating in large numbers in the mid to latter 19th century, spurred in particular by the ''[[Kulturkampf]]''.

Some 19th-century immigrants, especially the "Forty-Eighters", were secular, rejecting formal religion. About 250,000 German Jews had arrived by the 1870s, and they sponsored reform synagogues in many small cities across the country. About two million Central and Eastern European Jews arrived from the 1880s to 1924, bringing more traditional religious practices.<ref>Edward S. Shapiro, "Jews", in Elliott Barkan, ed. ''A Nation of Peoples'' (1999) 330–36.</ref>

After two or three generations, most German Americans adopted mainstream American customs — some of which they heavily influenced — and switched their language to English. As one scholar concludes, "The overwhelming evidence{{nbsp}}... indicates that the German-American school was a bilingual one much (perhaps a whole generation or more) earlier than 1917, and that the majority of the pupils may have been English-dominant bilinguals from the early 1880s on."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/540/handouts/gachurch/biggac.html|title=Language loyalty in the German-American Church: the Case of an Over-confident Minority.|website=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> By 1914, the older members attended German-language church services, while younger ones attended English services (in Lutheran, Evangelical and Catholic churches). In German parochial schools, the children spoke English among themselves, though some of their classes were in German. In 1917–18, after the American entry into World War{{nbsp}}I on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], nearly all German language instruction ended, as did most German-language church services.<ref name="Hawgood">{{Citation|last=Hawgood|first=John|title=The Tragedy of German-America|publisher=Arno Press|location=New York|date=1970}}</ref>

About 1.5 million Americans speak German at home, according to the 2000 census. From 1860 to 1917, German was widely spoken in German neighborhoods; see [[German in the United States]]. There is a false belief, called the [[Muhlenberg legend]], that German was almost the official language of the U.S. There was never any such proposal. The U.S. has no [[official language]], but use of German was strongly discouraged during World War{{nbsp}}I and fell out of daily use in many places.<ref>see [http://usa.usembassy.de/germanamericans-language.htm U.S. State Department, "German Language in the U.S"]</ref>

There were fierce battles in Wisconsin and Illinois around 1890 regarding proposals to stop the use of German as the primary language in public and parochial schools. The [[Bennett Law]] was a highly controversial state law passed in [[Wisconsin]] in 1889 that required the use of English to teach major subjects in all public and private elementary and high schools. It affected the state's many German-language private schools (and some Norwegian schools), and was bitterly resented by German American communities. The German Catholics and Lutherans each operated large networks of [[parochial school]]s in the state. Because the language used in the classroom was German, the law meant the teachers would have to be replaced with bilingual teachers, and in most cases shut down. The Germans formed a coalition between Catholics and Lutherans, under the leadership of the Democratic Party, and the language issue produced a landslide for the Democrats, as Republicans dropped the issue until World War{{nbsp}}I. By 1917, almost all schools taught in English, but courses in German were common in areas with large German populations. These courses were permanently dropped.<ref>Robert J. Ulrich, ''The Bennett Law of Eighteen Eighty-Nine: Education and Politics in Wisconsin'' (1981).</ref>

==Assimilation==

===The apparent disappearance of German American identity===
German Americans are no longer a conspicuous ethnic group.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2015/02/05/the-silent-minority|title=The silent minority|journal=The Economist|date=5 February 2015}}</ref> As Melvin G. Holli puts it, "Public expression of German ethnicity is nowhere proportionate to the number of German Americans in the nation's population. Almost nowhere are German Americans as a group as visible as many smaller groups. Two examples suffice to illustrate this point: when one surveys the popular television scene of the past decade, one hears Yiddish humor done by comedians; one sees Polish, Greek, and East European detective heroes; Italian-Americans in situation comedies; and blacks such as the Jeffersons and Huxtables. But one searches in vain for quintessentially German-American characters or melodramas patterned after German-American experiences.{{nbsp}}... A second example of the virtual invisibility is that, though German Americans have been one of the largest ethnic groups in the Chicago area (numbering near one-half million between 1900 and 1910), no museum or archive exists to memorialize that fact. On the other hand, many smaller groups such as Lithuanians, Poles, Swedes, Jews, and others have museums, archives, and exhibit halls dedicated to their immigrant forefathers".<ref name="Holli">{{cite book|editor-last1=Holli|editor-first1=Melvin G.|editor-last2=Jones|editor-first2=Peter d'A.|title=Ethnic Chicago: A Multicultural Portrait|last=Holli|first=Melvin G.|chapter=German American Ethnic and Cultural Identity from 1890 Onward|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2JbU1d9Xil0C|year=1995|publisher=William B.

By standard statistical measurement, the Germans were the largest immigrant group. Yet historians have been far more interested in Italian, Irish, Polish, and Eastern European Jewish immigration and culture. Irish bars, Italian restaurants, and Jewish humor abound. German language is rarely studied in high schools or colleges and German restaurants are an endangered culinary species. The blending of so many millions into the American mainstream with barely a trace is one of the major untold stories in American history".<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Parish|editor-first=Peter J.|title=Reader's Guide to American History|last=Leslie|first=W.

But this inconspicuousness was not always the case. By 1910, German Americans had created their own distinctive, vibrant, prosperous German-language communities, referred to collectively as "Germania". According to historian Walter Kamphoefner, a "number of big cities introduced German into their public school programs".<ref name="Ludden">{{cite web|author=Ludden, Jennifer|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102523977|title=German|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=April 1, 2009|accessdate=December 23, 2012}}</ref> [[Indianapolis]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] and other cities "had what we now call two-way immersion programs: school taught half in German, half in English".<ref name="Ludden" /> This was a tradition which continued "all the way down to World War{{nbsp}}I".<ref name="Ludden" /> According to Kamphoefner, German "was in a similar position as the Spanish language is in the 20th and 21st century"; it "was by far the most widespread foreign language, and whoever was the largest group was at a definite advantage in getting its language into the public sphere".<ref name="Ludden" /> Kamphoefner has come across evidence that as late as 1917, a German version of "The Star-Spangled Banner" was still being sung in public schools in Indianapolis.<ref name="Ludden" /> Cynthia Moothart O'Bannon, writing about [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], states that before World War{{nbsp}}I "German was the primary language in the homes, churches and parochial schools"<ref name="Fort Wayne">{{cite news|title=WWI altered the German accent of Allen County |first=Cynthia|last=Moothart O'Bannon|work=fortwayne.com |url=http://fwn-egen2.fortwayne.com/ns/projects/history/2000/1910/ind1.php }}</ref> of German American settlers. She states that "Many street signs were in German. (Main Street, for instance, was Haupt Strasse.) A large portion of local industry and commercial enterprises had at its roots German tooling and emigres. (An entire German town was moved to Fort Wayne when Wayne Knitting Mills opened.) Mayors, judges, firefighters and other community leaders had strong German ties. Social and sporting clubs and Germania Park in St. Joseph Township provided outlets to engage in traditional German activities".<ref name="Fort Wayne" /> She goes on to state that "The cultural influences were so strong, in fact, that the Chicago Tribune in 1893 declared Fort Wayne a 'most German town'."<ref name="Fort Wayne" /> Melvin G. Holli states that "No continental foreign-born group had been so widely and favorably received in the United States, or had won such high marks from its hosts as had the Germans before World War{{nbsp}}I. Some public opinion surveys conducted before the war showed German Americans were even more highly regarded than immigrants from the mother culture, England".<ref name="Holli" />{{rp|106}} Holli states that the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] once "had so many German-American musicians that the conductor often addressed them in the German language",<ref name="Holli" />{{rp|101}} and he states that "No ethnic theater in Chicago glittered with such a classy repertory as did the German-American theater, or served to introduce so many European classical works to American audiences".<ref name="Holli" />{{rp|102}}

The transition to the English language was abrupt, forced by federal, state and local governments, and by public opinion, when the U.S. was at war with Germany in 1917–18. After 1917, the [[German language]] was seldom heard in public; most newspapers and magazines closed; churches and parochial schools switched to English. Melvin G. Holli states, "In 1917, the Missouri Synod's Lutheran Church conference minutes appeared in English for the first time, and the synod's new constitution dropped its insistence on using the language of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] only and instead suggested bilingualism. Dozens of Lutheran schools also dropped instruction in the German language. English-language services also intruded themselves into parishes where German had been the ''lingua franca''. Whereas only 471 congregations nationwide held English services in 1910, the number preaching in English in the synod skyrocketed to 2,492 by 1919. The German Evangelical Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and other states also anglicized its name by dropping German from the title".<ref name="Holli" />{{rp|106}} Writing about Fort Wayne, Indiana, Cynthia Moothart O'Bannon states that, in the First World War, "Local churches were forced to discontinue sermons in German, schools were pressured to stop teaching in German, and the local library director was ordered to purchase no more books written in German. The library shelves also were purged of English-language materials deemed sympathetic to or neutral on Germany. Anti-German sentiment forced the renaming of several local institutions. Teutonia Building, Loan & Savings became Home Loan & Savings, and The German-American bank became Lincoln National Bank & Trust Co."<ref name="Fort Wayne" /> She continues that "in perhaps the most obvious bend to prevailing trends, Berghoff Brewery changed its motto from "A very German brew" to "A very good brew," according to "Fort Wayne: A Most German Town," a documentary produced by local public television station WFWA, Channel 39".<ref name="Fort Wayne" /> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote how "I could hear the pain in my German-American father's voice as he recalled being yanked out of Lutheran school during World War{{nbsp}}I and forbidden by his immigrant parents ever to speak German again".<ref>{{cite news |date= April 12, 2002 |last= Ebert |first= Roger |author-link= Roger Ebert |url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/maryam-2002 |title=I could hear the pain in my German-American father's voice |newspaper= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate= September 19, 2019 }}</ref>

Melvin G. Holli states, regarding Chicago, that "After the Great War it became clear that no ethnic group was so de-ethnicized in its public expression by a single historic event as German Americans. While Polish Americans, Lithuanian Americans, and other subject nationalities underwent a great consciousness raising, German ethnicity fell into a protracted and permanent slump. The war damaged public expression of German ethnic, linguistic, and cultural institutions almost beyond repair".<ref name="Holli" />{{rp|106}} He states that, after the war, German ethnicity "would never regain its prewar public acclaim, its larger-than-life public presence, with its symbols, rituals, and, above all, its large numbers of people who took pride in their Teutonic ancestry and enjoyed the role of Uncle Sam's favored adopted son".<ref name="Holli" />{{rp|107}} He states "A key indicator of the decline of "Deutschtum" in Chicago was the census: the number identifying themselves to the census-taker as German-born plummeted from 191,000 in 1910 to 112,000 in 1920. This drop far exceeds the natural mortality rate or the number who might be expected to move. Self-identifiers had found it prudent to claim some nationality other than German. To claim German nationality had become too painful an experience".<ref name="Holli" />{{rp|106}} Along similar lines, Terrence G. Wiley states that, in Nebraska, "around 14 percent of the population had identified itself as being of German-origin in 1910; however, only 4.4 percent made comparable assertions in 1920. In Wisconsin, the decline in percentage of those identifying themselves as Germans was even more obvious. The 1920 census reported only 6.6. percent of the population as being of German-origin, as opposed to nearly 29 percent ten years earlier{{nbsp}}... These statistics led Burnell{{nbsp}}... to conclude that: "No other North American ethnic group, past or present, has attempted so forcefully to officially conceal their{{nbsp}}... ethnic origins. One must attribute this reaction to the wave of repression that swept the Continent and enveloped anyone with a German past"".<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Kibbee|editor-first=Douglas A.|title=Language Legislation and Linguistic Rights|last=Wiley|first=Terrence G.|chapter=What Happens After English is Declared the Official Language of the United States?|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vURAAAAAQBAJ|year=1998|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027275073}}</ref>

The Catholic high schools were deliberately structured to commingle ethnic groups so as to promote ethnic (but not interreligious) intermarriage.<ref>Edward R. Kantowicz, ''Corporation Sole: Cardinal Mundelein and Chicago Catholicism'' (1983)</ref> German-speaking taverns, beer gardens and saloons were all shut down by prohibition; those that reopened in 1933 spoke English.

While its impact appears to be less well-known and studied than the impact which World War{{nbsp}}I had on German Americans, World War{{nbsp}}II was likewise difficult for them and likewise had the impact of forcing them to drop distinctive German characteristics and assimilate into the general US culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://loyolanotredamelib.org/php/report05/articles/pdfs/report44Holian81-98.pdf |title=FRAGILE AND BELEAGUERED ARE THE MANY:THE RECURRENCE OF ANTI-GERMAN ACTIVITIES DURING WORLD WAR II |website=loyolanotredamelib.org |access-date=2020-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/ttu-ir/bitstream/handle/2346/12405/31295019381176.pdf?sequence |title=ALLEGIANCE AND HERITAGE: THE GERMAN-AMERICANs OF FREDERICKSBURG, TEXAS IN THE NAZI ERA, 1933-1945 |last=McIntyre |first=Jennifer |date=2004 |website= ttu-ir.tdl.org|format=PDF|access-date=2020-08-25}}</ref> According to Melvin G. Holli, "By 1930, some German American leaders in Chicago felt, as Dr. Leslie Tischauser put it, 'the damage done by the wartime experience had been largely repaired'. The German language was being taught in the schools again; the German theater still survived; and German Day celebrations were drawing larger and larger crowds. Although the assimilation process had taken its toll of pre-1914 German immigrants, a smaller group of newer postwar arrivals had developed a vocal if not impolitic interest in the rebuilding process in Germany under [[National Socialism]]. As the 1930s moved on, Hitler's brutality and Nazi excesses made Germanism once again suspect. The rise of Nazism, as Luebke notes, 'transformed German ethnicity in America into a source of social and psychological discomfort, if not distress. The overt expression of German-American opinion consequently declined, and in more recent years, virtually disappeared as a reliable index of political attitudes{{nbsp}}...'"<ref name="Holli" />{{rp|108}} Holli goes on to state that "The pain increased during the late 1930s and early 1940s, when Congressman Martin Dies held public hearings about the menace of Nazi subversives and spies among the German Americans. In 1940, the Democratic party's attack on anti-war elements as disloyal and pro-Nazi, and the advent of the war itself, made German ethnicity too heavy a burden to bear. As Professor Tischauser wrote, "The notoriety gained by those who supported the German government between 1933 and 1941 cast a pall over German-Americans everywhere. Leaders of the German-American community would have great difficulty rebuilding an ethnic consciousness{{nbsp}}... Few German-Americans could defend what Hitler{{nbsp}}... had done to millions of people in pursuit of the 'final solution', and the wisest course for German-Americans was to forget any attachment to the German half of their heritage.""<ref name="Holli" />{{rp|108–109}} Jennifer Hansler has stated that "[[Fred Trump]] sought to pass himself off as Swedish amid anti-German sentiment sparked by World War{{nbsp}}II";<ref name="CNN Swedish">{{cite news|title=Trump's family denied German heritage for years |first=Jennifer|last=Hansler|date=28 November 2017|work=[[CNN]] |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/28/politics/trump-family-heritage/index.html }}</ref> [[Donald Trump|Donald]] reaffirmed this myth in ''[[The Art of the Deal]]''.<ref name="CNN Swedish" /><ref>{{cite news|title=Donald Trump claimed he was of Swedish ancestry - but it's a lie|first=Vilhelm|last=Carlström|date=28 November 2017|work=[[Business Insider]]|url=https://nordic.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-told-the-world-he-was-of-swedish-ancestry---but-its-a-lie-2016-8|access-date=26 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418085603/https://nordic.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-told-the-world-he-was-of-swedish-ancestry---but-its-a-lie-2016-8|archive-date=18 April 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=For Donald Trump's Family, an Immigrant's Tale With 2 Beginnings |first=Jason|last=Horowitz|date=21 August 2016|work=[[New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/22/us/politics/for-donald-trumps-family-an-immigrants-tale-with-2-beginnings.html}}</ref>

By the 1940s, Germania had largely vanished outside some rural areas and the Germans were thoroughly assimilated.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2169006|title = Revisting Assimilation: The Rise, Fall, and Reappraisal of a Concept in American Ethnic History|journal = The American Historical Review|volume = 100|issue = 2|pages = 437–471|last1 = Kazal|first1 = Russell A.|year = 1995|doi = 10.2307/2169006}}</ref> According to Melvin G. Holli, by the end of World War{{nbsp}}II, German Americans "were ethnics without any visible national or local leaders. Not even politicians would think of addressing them explicitly as an ethnic constituency as they would say, Polish Americans, Jewish Americans, or African Americans."<ref name="Holli" />{{rp|109}} Holli states that "Being on the wrong side in two wars had a devastating and long-term negative impact on the public celebration of German-American ethnicity".<ref name="Holli" />{{rp|106}}

Historians have tried to explain what became of the German Americans and their descendants. Kazal (2004) looks at Germans in Philadelphia, focusing on four ethnic subcultures: middle-class Vereinsdeutsche, working-class socialists, Lutherans, and Catholics. Each group followed a somewhat distinctive path toward assimilation. Lutherans, and the better situated Vereinsdeutsche with whom they often overlapped, after World War{{nbsp}}I abandoned the last major German characteristics and redefined themselves as old stock or as "Nordic" Americans, stressing their colonial roots in Pennsylvania and distancing themselves from more recent immigrants. On the other hand, working-class and Catholic Germans, groups that heavily overlapped, lived and worked with [[Irish Americans|Irish]] and other European ethnics; they also gave up German characteristics but came to identify themselves as white ethnics, distancing themselves above all from [[African American]] recent arrivals in nearby neighborhoods. Well before World War{{nbsp}}I, women in particular were becoming more and more involved in a mass consumer culture that lured them out of their German-language neighborhood shops and into English language downtown department stores. The 1920s and 1930s brought English language popular culture via movies and radio that drowned out the few surviving German language venues.<ref name="Kazal">Russell A. Kazal, ''Becoming Old Stock: The Paradox of German-American Identity'' (2004).</ref>

===Factors making German Americans susceptible to assimilation===
Kazal points out that German Americans have not had an experience that is especially typical of immigrant groups. "Certainly, in a number of ways, the German-American experience was idiosyncratic. No other large immigrant group was subjected to such strong, sustained pressure to abandon its ethnic identity for an American one. None was so divided internally, a characteristic that made German Americans especially vulnerable to such pressure. Among the larger groups that immigrated in the country after 1830, none - despite regional variations - appears to have muted its ethnic identity to so great an extent."<ref name="Kazal" />{{rp|273}} This quote from Kazal identifies both external pressures on German Americans and internal dividedness among them as reasons for their high level of assimilation.

Regarding the external pressures, Kazal writes: "The pressure imposed on German Americans to forsake their ethnic identity was extreme in both nature and duration. No other ethnic group saw its 'adoptive fatherland' twice enter a world war against its country of origin. To this stigma, the Third Reich added the lasting one of [[the Holocaust]]. In her study of ethnic identity in the 1980s, sociologist Mary Waters noted that the 'effect of the Nazi movement and World War{{nbsp}}II was still quite strong' in shaping 'popular perceptions of the German-American character', enough so that some individuals of mixed background often would acknowledge only the non-German part of their ancestry."<ref name="Kazal" />{{rp|273}}{{efn|In the book that Kazal appears to be quoting here, Waters states "Many people cited various political or social events as having an effect on their consciousness and degree of ethnic identity. I have already noted Laurie Jablonski's stronger identification with her Polish than with her German ancestry, a fact she attributed to the influence her surname had on how others reacted to her. When I asked about times when the relative influence of one or the other side might be stronger, she revealed that political events in Germany and Poland had a lot to do with how she chose to identify herself".<ref name="Waters">{{cite book|title=Ethnic Options: Choosing Identities in America|last=Waters|first=Mary C.|url=https://archive.org/details/ethnicoptionscho0000wate|url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520070837}}</ref>{{rp|83}} Waters goes on to state that "The association of being German with being a Nazi is still strong for Laurie, forty years after World War{{nbsp}}II. A similar story to Laurie's is related in a description by Hinda Winawer-Steiner and Norbert Wetzel of a workshop for family therapists on ethnicity and family therapy. The therapists were supposed to talk about their ethnicity and how it might influence their work. A discussion of a German-American family revealed that two of the therapists who had identified themselves as Polish-American at the beginning of the workshop were, in fact, half German. It turned out that they were suppressing their German identity because of the negative connotations associated with being German. "When asked, one explained that she simply considered herself Polish. The other, after some reflection, said that in a group that was half Jewish, she had been reluctant to acknowledge her German heritage" (Winawer-Steiner and Wetzel 1982, 253)".<ref name="Waters" />{{rp|84}}}} Kazal contrasts this experience with the experiences of the Japanese, Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Italians, east European Jews, and Irish. "Japanese Americans, of course, suffered far more during the Second World War",<ref name="Kazal" />{{rp|273}} but until at least the 1950s, the pressure on Japanese Americans "ran toward exclusion from, rather than inclusion in, the nation".<ref name="Kazal" />{{rp|273}} "The state and many ordinary European Americans refused to recognize Asians as potentially American. In contrast, they pressured Germans to accept precisely that American identity in place of a German one".<ref name="Kazal" />{{rp|273}} Kazal goes on to state "The burden of "enemy" status made those pressures far greater for Germans than for other European ethnic groups. To some extent, American intervention in World War{{nbsp}}I actually helped fuel ethnic nationalism in the United States among Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Italians, and east European Jews, who felt their desires for existing or prospective homelands stood to gain from an Allied victory. Indeed, some historians have depicted the following decade as one when immigrants transcended local or regional homeland affiliations to craft or further consolidate national identities as Poles, Czechs, and Italians. Such groups escaped the fury of "100 percent Americanism" during the war, in part because of their obvious stake in the defeat of the Central Powers".<ref name="Kazal" />{{rp|273–274}} As for Irish Americans, Kazal states that the lack of enthusiasm of many of them for helping England made them "vulnerable to the wartime "antihyphen" climate",<ref name="Kazal" />{{rp|274}} but that "Irish nationalist activity intensified during and immediately after that war, as many Irish Americans became swept up in the events leading to the creation of the Irish Free State",<ref name="Kazal" />{{rp|274}} and that "It made a difference for the long-term viability of Irish-American identity that the Irish homeland not only did not go to war with the United States but, in fact, emerged during the interwar years as a sovereign nation".<ref name="Kazal" />{{rp|274}}

Kazal then goes on to discuss the internal dividedness. He writes: "German-American identity fell victim not only to a peculiar set of events, but also to an extraordinarily high level of internal diversity. All ethnic groups have internal divides, whether of class, religion, gender, politics, or homeland region. What distinguished German America was that it incorporated not just some but ''all'' of these divisions. Irish Americans, for example, had lost their status as primarily a proletarian group by 1900, yet they were united by religion and politics. "Irish American" had come to mean Irish Catholic; the vast majority of Irish Americans subscribed to some form of Irish nationalism conflated with American patriotism; and Irish-American voters were overwhelmingly Democrats. The power of this synthesis, Kerby Miller argued, explains the survival of Irish-American identity despite the ebbing of organised Irish-American nationalism after the Free State's founding. For German Americans, religion and party politics were sources of division rather than of unity".<ref name="Kazal" />{{rp|274}} Kazal goes on to state that "The subcultures of German America, meanwhile, had ample opportunity for contact, however testy, with non-German counterparts. The latter beckoned as destinations when the cost of being German-American rose too high".<ref name="Kazal" />{{rp|274}} It is not just Kazal who has pointed out the internal dividedness of the German American community. Kathleen Neils Conzen has pointed it out; David Peterson states that Conzen, "along with many others, concludes that German-Americans' heterogeneity, particularly in religion, hampered their ability to build socially and politically stable ethnic communities",<ref name="Peterson">{{cite journal|journal=Journal of American Ethnic History|volume=11|issue=2|pages=27–55|jstor = 27500930|last1 = Peterson|first1 = David|title="From Bone Depth": German-American Communities in Rural Minnesota before the Great War|year=1992}}</ref>{{rp|27}} and that Conzen "stresses that German Americans assimilated relatively rapidly and that their diversity played a key role in that assimilation".<ref name="Peterson" />{{rp|47}}{{efn|Peterson himself seems not to fully agree with this, stating "Most community studies have examined very large, heterogeneous German-American urban populations that assimilated relatively quickly or, less commonly, large, homogeneous rural ones that did not. Hence, German-Americans' diversity has emerged as perhaps the crucial variable accounting for their assimilationist propensities. Otter Tail County, certainly a rural area, had German-American communities that were diverse and small, and these communities succeeded in maintaining crucial ethnic boundaries into the twentieth century. The persistence of these heterogeneous, lightly populated German-American communities suggest that place of residence was the key factor in the rate of German-American assimilation. Urban orientation may have corroded German-American ethnic boundaries more than diversity did, though the two variables were not unrelated".<ref name="Peterson" />{{rp|47–48}}}} (Conzen is also drawn upon by Joy Kristina Adams, who cites Conzen when she (Adams) states that "The diversity and size of the German settlements made them susceptible to long-term Americanization by fostering factionalism, increasing contacts between Germans and non-Germans, and weakening unified leadership".)<ref>[https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/2652/adamsj55244.pdf Going ''Deutsch'': Heritage Tourism and Identity in German Texas], p. 45</ref> The ''Encyclopedia of the Great Plains'' also stresses the internal dividedness, stating "One of the distinguishing characteristics of the German population in North America (especially in comparison to other immigrant groups) has been its relative degree of cultural diversity, reflected especially in the number of Christian denominations to which Germans belonged. In part this reflects patterns that had developed over centuries in Germany, whose population came to include nearly every variety of Christianity–from Catholics, Lutherans, and Reformed groups to more radical Anabaptist pietistic movements such as Amish, Mennonites, Schwenkfelders, and the Moravian church. It is not surprising, then, that nearly all of these denominations were represented among the German immigrant population in North America."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.ea.013|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains - GERMANS|website=plainshumanities.unl.edu}}</ref> Robert Paul McCaffery points out that "Despite their numbers{{nbsp}}... and unlike many immigrant groups, Germans never united as a powerful ethnic block.

St. Louis served (and still does) as the seat of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, a conservative American Lutheran confession, and their local strength led to friction with Germans of other faiths. These Lutherans did not traffic much with the sizable German Catholic population of the city, who often shared their houses of worship and political stances with the Irish. The small rabbinical German Jewish community remained insular. The Freethinkers, atheists, socialists, et al., had little use for any of these groups. In addition, the Germans, while heavily concentrated in a few pockets of north and south St. Louis, were spread across the city proper and into the larger countryside".<ref name="Baker" />{{rp|99}} And according to the [[Max Kade]] Institute for German-American Studies, "The diversity of religious expression among German-speaking immigrants was paralleled by a high degree of heterogeneity stemming from differences in regional and linguistic origins. This situation differed from that of other nineteenth-century immigrant groups, notably the Irish, but also Italians and people of other European backgrounds. The resulting lack of a unified and clearly definable German-American community explains in part why only few Americans, including those of German descent, have any idea when Steuben Day or German-American Day falls, whereas the Irish St. Patrick's Day is one of America's most popular celebrations, and Columbus Day, named after the Italian explorer, is a federal holiday".<ref name="Max Kade Institute">{{cite web|url=https://mki.wisc.edu/content/how-german-american-building-communities|title=How German Is American? Building Communities - Max Kade Institute|website=mki.wisc.edu}}</ref>{{efn|A similar statement about the diversity of German Americans has been made by Andrew R. L. Cayton: "In the process of participating in the public culture of Ohio, some Germans struggled to keep connections with their birthplaces. A coherent community was difficult to maintain, however. Proud as they were of 'Deutschthum', or the sum of Germanness, it became increasingly vague. Germans were too diverse in terms of religion and politics. 'Wherever four Germans gathered,' observed the ''Deutsche Pionier'' in 1879, 'they will find four different ideas.'"<ref>{{cite book|title=Ohio: The History of a People|last=Cayton|first=Andrew R.

Miller. Writing about [[New Orleans]], Miller states "During the nineteenth century, the Irish and Germans provided the largest numbers of mmigrants and gave the city its immigrant cast. The Irish and Germans differed in their ethnic cohesiveness and interactions with the host culture(s)".<ref name="Miller">{{cite book|editor-last=Stolarik|editor-first=M.

They were widely dispersed throughout the Second and Third Municipalities, and in Carrollton and Lafayette, and they were fragmented by differences in religion, region of origin, and class. The proliferation of German clubs, associations, and institutions bespoke the Germans' numerical significance in the city, but it also attested to their divisions, for such organizations tended to cater to very specific groups rather than bind the various German strands together. To be sure, distinct concentrations of Germans existed in various parts of the city, wherein various German cultural values survived and influenced the culture of non-Germans in their midst, and German ''Gemütlichkeit'' was easily accommodated in the city's genial public culture. But, overall, Germans were too diverse and divided to dominate the city".<ref name="Miller" />{{rp|129}} Miller contrasts this situation with the situation of Irish Americans in New Orleans: "Irish immigrants had greater cohesion and wider influence than the Germans. In the great waves of late antebellum immigration, the vast majority of Irish immigrants entering New Orleans came from a few select counties in Ireland. They shared a common faith, poverty, and national identity.{{nbsp}}... New Orleans was small enough so that dispersal did not diminish Irish power; in fact, Irish immigrants everywhere shared so many common cultural and class interests that dispersion served to broaden Irish influence on the city's culture".<ref name="Miller" />{{rp|129}}}}

===Persistence of German language ===
Despite the remarkable level of language assimilation reached by German Americans, distinct German usage survived well into the mid/late-20th century in some places. Writing about the town of [[Hustisford, Wisconsin]], Jennifer Ludden discusses Mel Grulke, who was born in 1941, with German his first language at home; "Grulke's great-grandparents immigrated to the U.S. in the late 1880s, yet three generations later, his farmer parents still spoke German at home, attended German language church services and chatted in German with shopkeepers when they brought their farm eggs into town to sell".<ref name="Ludden" /> Bethany Lutheran Church in Hustisford offered German-language services into the 1970s;<ref name="Ludden" /> Zum Kripplein Christi, in the same county as Hustisford ([[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge County]]), "offered a Sunday service in German as recently as the 1990s";<ref name="Max Kade Institute" /> St. Luke Lutheran Church, in [[Wishek, North Dakota]], still held German-language services until as recently as about 1994;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://library.ndsu.edu/grhc/articles/newspapers/news/gutentag.html|title=Germans from Russia Heritage Collection|website=library.ndsu.edu}}</ref> St. Matthew's Lutheran Church in San Francisco still holds German-language services to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.germanamericanpioneers.org/GermansAmericanHistoryinSanFrancisco.htm|title=Germans American History in San Francisco|website=www.germanamericanpioneers.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmatthews-sf.org/about/|title=About Us|website=St. Matthews Lutheran Church}}</ref> Homer Rudolf, a man from North Dakota of [[Germans from Russia|German Russian]] descent, stated in 2004 that his maternal grandmother, who died in 1980 at the age of 90, "did not learn English".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.ndsu.edu/grhc/history_culture/oral/samples/homer_rudolf.html |title=Germans from Russia Heritage Collection |publisher=Library.ndsu.edu |date=September 18, 2004 |accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref> As recently as 1990, one quarter of North Dakota's households included a German speaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/02/us/north-dakota-with-german-roots-adopts-spanish-as-second-language.html|title=North Dakota, With German Roots, Adopts Spanish as Second Language|first=James|last=Brooke|date=2 March 1996|accessdate=28 August 2017|website=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

To this day, German speakers can be found in the United States among long-established [[Anabaptist]] groups - the [[Amish|Old Order Amish]] and most [[Old Order Mennonite]]s speak [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] (or [[Bernese German]] or [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]] by a minority of Amish) along with [[High German]] to various degrees (though they are generally fluent in English).<ref>{{cite book |last=Skutsch |first=Carl |title=Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |page=101}}</ref> All [[Hutterite]]s speak [[Hutterite German]] and many [[Russian Mennonite|"Russian" Mennonites]] speak [[Plautdietsch]], a German dialect coming originally from the area around [[Danzig]]. The three Amish dialects as well as Hutterite German are still learned by all children of the group, whereas Plautdietsch-speakers tend much more to switch to English. Another group of German-speakers can be found in the [[Amana Colonies]] in Iowa; according to the website Statistical Atlas, all the residents of [[East Amana, Iowa|East Amana]] speak German at home, and only 67.7% can speak English "very well".<ref>[https://statisticalatlas.com/place/Iowa/East-Amana/Languages Languages in East Amana, Iowa (Unincorporated Place) - Statistical Atlas]</ref>

It has been shown that cultural differences between the attitudes towards farming of German Americans, on the one hand, and of British-ancestry "Yankees", on the other, lasted into the 1980s and have to some extend lasted into the 21st century; German Americans have tended to see farming in a more family-oriented manner than Yankees.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Fischer, Claude S.|url=http://bostonreview.net/blog/claude-fischer-midwest-farms-german-family-culture|title=Family Farms vs. Americanism|magazine=[[Boston Review]]|date=May 4, 2015|accessdate=January 31, 2019}}</ref>

Germans have contributed to a vast number of areas in American culture and technology. [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]], a former [[Prussia]]n officer, led the reorganization of the [[U.S. Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|war for independence]] and helped make the victory against the British possible. The [[Steinway & Sons]] piano manufacturing firm was founded by immigrant [[Henry E. Steinway]] in 1853. German settlers brought the [[Christmas tree]] custom and other [[Weihnachten|German Christmas traditions]] to the United States. The [[Studebaker]]s built large numbers of wagons used during the Western migration; Studebaker, like the [[Duesenberg]] brothers, later became an important early automobile manufacturer. [[Carl Schurz]], a refugee from the unsuccessful first German democratic [[revolution of 1848]] became an influential politician first in the Republican then in the Democratic party, and served as U.S. [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=s000151|title=SCHURZ, Carl, (1829 - 1906)|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref>

After World War II, [[Wernher von Braun]], and most of the leading engineers from the former German V-2 rocket base at [[Peenemünde]], were brought to the U.S. They contributed decisively to the development of U.S. military rockets, as well as rockets for the [[NASA]] space program and the initiation of the [[Apollo program]] to land on the Moon.<ref name="paper">{{Citation |url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/paperclip.gif |title=Outstanding German Scientists Being Brought to U.S. |work=War Department press release |date=1945-10-01 |publisher=V2Rocket.com}}</ref> Similarly, fellow German aviation technologist [[Siegfried Knemeyer]], the former top aviation technologist within ''Reichsmarschall'' [[Hermann Göring]]'s [[Reich Air Ministry]] during World War{{nbsp}}II, was brought to the United States through a similar path to von Braun, and served as a civilian employee of the [[USAF]] for over twenty years.

The influence of [[German cuisine]] is seen in the [[cuisine of the United States]] throughout the country, especially regarding pastries, meats and sausages, and above all, beer. [[Hot dog|Frankfurters]] (or "wieners", originating from [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Vienna]], respectively), [[hamburger]]s, [[bratwurst]], [[sauerkraut]], and [[strudel]] are common dishes. German bakers introduced the [[pretzel]], which is popular across the United States.

"[http://www.beerhistory.com/library/holdings/yuengling.shtml Yuengling of Pottsville: America's Oldest Brewery]". Retrieved December 8, 2006.</ref> By the late 19th century, [[Milwaukee]], with a large population of German origin, was once the home to four of the world's largest breweries owned by ethnic Germans (Schlitz, Blatz, Pabst, and Miller) and was the number one beer producing city in the world for many years. Almost half of all current beer sales in the United States can be attributed to German immigrants, Capt. A. Pabst, Eberhard Anheuser, and Adolphus Busch, who founded [[Anheuser-Busch]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] in 1860.<ref name="Amy Mittelman 2007"/> Later German immigrants figured prominently in the rebirth of craft brews following [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], culminating in the [[microbrewery|microbrew]] movement that swept the U.S. beginning in the late 1980s.

German and German-American celebrations, such as [[Oktoberfest]], [[Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria|Rhenish Carnival]], [[German-American Day]] and [[Von Steuben Day]] are held regularly throughout the country.
