==History==
Both members of Florida Georgia Line first gained interest in music through church worship services. Brian Kelley, from [[Ormond Beach, Florida]], was a star pitcher on his high school baseball team, leading to a scholarship at [[Florida State University]]; he later transferred to [[Belmont University]] after it became clear to him he would not succeed in the sport.<ref name="answers"/> He began learning to play guitar then began writing music inspired by [[Christian rock]] group [[Casting Crowns]].<ref name="billboard"/> Tyler Hubbard, a native of [[Monroe, Georgia]], was a church worship leader who formed a hip hop group, Ingenious Circuit, in his teens. The two had a myriad of musical interests growing up: "Me and my friends drove trucks, listened to [[Garth Brooks]], [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], [[Lil Wayne]] and [[Eminem]]," said Kelley.<ref name="billboard"/>

The duo met at Belmont University in 2008 through a campus worship group, and following graduation, decided to give themselves two years to succeed as a country duo. They moved in together and began several odd jobs to pay bills, while playing clubs on the weekends.<ref name="answers">{{cite web |last1=Black |first1=Lauren |title=An In-Depth Look at Florida Georgia Line |url=http://countrymusic.answers.com/duos/an-in-depth-look-at-florida-georgia-line |website=Answers.com |accessdate=October 9, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723110455/http://countrymusic.answers.com/duos/an-in-depth-look-at-florida-georgia-line |archivedate=July 23, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="countryweekly">{{cite web|url=http://www.countryweekly.com/reviews/itz-just-what-we-do-florida-georgia-line|title=It'z Just What We Do by Florida Georgia Line|work=[[Country Weekly]]|accessdate=July 24, 2012|archive-date=August 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818175859/http://www.countryweekly.com/reviews/itz-just-what-we-do-florida-georgia-line|url-status=live}}</ref> While independent, they recorded and digitally distributed their first [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Anything Like Me (Florida Georgia Line EP)|Anything Like Me]]'' (2010).<ref name="answers"/> They were discovered by [[Nickelback]] producer Joey Moi at a county fair, and the three began entering the studio together.<ref name="billboard"/> Unlike typical country music sessions, the group spent days polishing songs, which were collected on the duo's second EP, ''[[It'z Just What We Do]]'' (2012). In terms of production, the band modeled their sound on bands such as Nickelback, [[Shinedown]], and [[Three Days Grace]], while Moi aimed for each song to resemble hair metal group [[Def Leppard]] in structure.<ref name="billboard"/> Major labels became interested when the song "[[Cruise (song)|Cruise]]" first aired on satellite radio on [[The Highway (Sirius XM)|The Highway]] channel and began selling well in the [[iTunes Store]], leading to a deal with Republic Nashville and Big Machine Label Group.<ref name="billboard">{{cite news|title=Billboard Cover: Florida Georgia Line on Being 'Professional Partiers,' Haters and Hip-Hop|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6281327/florida-georgia-line-billboard-cover-story|date=October 10, 2014|author=Rob Tannenbaum|accessdate=December 28, 2014|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|archive-date=December 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229091523/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6281327/florida-georgia-line-billboard-cover-story|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Philanthropy and impact ==

In 2014, the band was the face of the [[General Mills]] "Outnumber Hunger" campaign, which raised $1.2M for [[Feeding America]].<ref name="generalmills_2014-03-12">{{cite web|url=https://blog.generalmills.com/2014/03/florida-georgia-line-helps-fight-hunger/|title=Florida Georgia Line helps fight hunger|date=March 12, 2014|accessdate=December 7, 2018|archive-date=February 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204174747/http://blog.generalmills.com/2014/03/florida-georgia-line-helps-fight-hunger/|url-status=live}}</ref>

"Through our experiences with Outnumber Hunger, we have learned the far reach of hunger in America, affecting people from all different backgrounds," said Tyler Hubbard, the Georgia half of Florida Georgia Line. "This year, we're proud to take an even bigger role in the fight against hunger and rally the nation to help those in need."<ref name="generalmills_2014-03-12"/>

== Businesses ==
Florida Georgia Line has taken advantage of their musical career success and used it to open other businesses that have been successful partially because of the popularity in the country music community. They have used their music to promote their own brand of whiskey “Old Camp Whiskey” in their song Smooth and their feature on Morgan Wallen’s Album If I know Me in the song Up Down ft. Florida Georgia Line. The duo also has a restaurant named FGL House in Nashville, TN, as well as a new creative compound in Nashville, that is home to three businesses. The three business are meet + greet, Tree Vibez Music (which is a publishing company launched by Kelley and Hubbard in 2015), and Tribe Kelley Trading Post (which is a business started by Brian Kelley and his wife.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenjoblack/2018/11/02/florida-georgia-line-expands-empire-with-new-creative-compound-in-nashville/#e58fe5e44e31|title=Florida Georgia Line Expands Empire With New Creative Compound In Nashville|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=2 August 2019|archive-date=March 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190301140001/https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenjoblack/2018/11/02/florida-georgia-line-expands-empire-with-new-creative-compound-in-nashville/#e58fe5e44e31|url-status=live}}</ref> The two men launched Round Here Records in 2019; an independent label with [[Canaan Smith]] signed as the flagship artist.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8527481/florida-georgia-line-round-here-records-canaan-smith| last=Reuter| first=Annie| title=Florida Georgia Line Launch Round Here Records With Flagship Artist Canaan Smith: Exclusive| magazine=Billboard| date=August 15, 2019| accessdate=August 17, 2019| archive-date=August 15, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815181652/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/8527481/florida-georgia-line-round-here-records-canaan-smith| url-status=live}}</ref>
