==Name==
Guinea is named after the [[Guinea (region)|Guinea region]]. Guinea is a traditional name for the region of Africa that lies along the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. It stretches north through the [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|forested tropical regions]] and ends at the [[Sahel]]. The English term Guinea comes directly from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''Guin√©'', which emerged in the mid-15th century to refer to the lands inhabited by the ''Guineus'', a generic term for the black African peoples south of the [[Senegal River]], in contrast to the "tawny" Zenaga Berbers above it, whom they called ''Azenegues'' or [[Moors]].

The land that is now Guinea belonged to a series of African empires until France colonized it in the 1890s, and made it part of [[French West Africa]]. Guinea declared its independence from France on 2 October 1958. From independence until the [[Guinean presidential election, 2010|presidential election]] of 2010, Guinea was governed by a number of [[Autocracy|autocratic]] rulers.<ref>

For the origin of the name "Guinea" see {{section link|Guinea (region)|Etymology}}.

===West African empires and Kingdoms in Guinea===
{{main|Imamate of Futa Jallon|Wassoulou Empire}}

What is now Guinea was on the fringes of the major West African empires. The earliest, the [[Ghana Empire]], grew on trade but ultimately fell after repeated incursions of the [[Almoravids]]. It was in this period that Islam first arrived in the region by way of North African traders.

The [[Sosso]] kingdom (12th to 13th centuries) briefly flourished in the resulting void but the [[Mali Empire]] came to prominence when [[Sundiata Keita|Soundiata K√©√Øta]] defeated the Sosso ruler [[Soumaoro Kant√©|Soumangourou Kant√©]] at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. The Mali Empire was ruled by [[Mansa (title)|Mansa]] (Emperors), the most famous being [[Musa I of Mali|Kankou Moussa]], who made a famous [[hajj]] to Mecca in 1324. Shortly after his reign the Mali Empire began to decline and was ultimately supplanted by its [[vassal]] states in the 15th century.

The most successful of these was the [[Songhai Empire]], which expanded its power from about 1460 and eventually surpassed the Mali Empire in both territory and wealth. It continued to prosper until a civil war over succession followed the death of [[Askia Daoud]] in 1582. The weakened empire fell to invaders from [[Morocco]] at the [[Battle of Tondibi]] just three years later. The Moroccans proved unable to rule the kingdom effectively, however, and it split into many small kingdoms.

[[File:Almamy Samory Tour√©.jpg|thumb|[[Samori Toure]] was the founder of the [[Wassoulou Empire]], an [[Islamic]] state in present-day Guinea that resisted French colonial rule in West Africa from 1882 until Tour√©'s capture in 1898.]]

After the fall of the major West African empires, various kingdoms existed in what is now Guinea. [[Fulani]] Muslims migrated to [[Futa Jallon]] in Central Guinea and established an Islamic state from 1727 to 1896 with a written constitution and alternate rulers. The [[Wassoulou Empire|Wassoulou or Wassulu empire]] was a short-lived (1878‚Äì1898) empire, led by [[Samori Toure]] in the predominantly [[Mandinka people|Malink√©]] area of what is now upper Guinea and southwestern [[Mali]] (Wassoulou). It moved to [[Ivory Coast]] before being conquered by the French.

===Colonial era===
The European traders arrived in the 16th century. Slaves were exported to work elsewhere in the [[triangular trade]]. The traders exploited the regional slave practices that had existed for centuries of trading in human beings.

Guinea's colonial period began with French military penetration into the area in the mid-19th century. French domination was assured by the defeat in 1898 of the armies of [[Samori Tour√©]], Mansa (or Emperor) of the [[Ouassoulou]] state and leader of Malink√© descent, which gave France control of what today is Guinea and adjacent areas.

France negotiated Guinea's present boundaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the British for [[Sierra Leone]], the Portuguese for their Guinea colony (now [[Guinea-Bissau]]), and [[Liberia]]. Under the French, the country formed the [[French Guinea|Territory of Guinea]] within [[French West Africa]], administered by a governor general resident in [[Dakar]]. Lieutenant governors administered the individual colonies, including Guinea.

===Independence and post-colonial rule (1958‚Äì2008)===
In 1958, the [[French Fourth Republic]] collapsed due to political instability and its failures in dealing with its colonies, especially [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]]. The founding of a [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] was supported by the French people, while French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] made it clear on 8 August 1958 that France's colonies were to be given a stark choice between more [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] in a new [[French Community]] or immediate independence in the referendum to be held on 28 September 1958. The other colonies chose the former but Guinea‚Äîunder the leadership of [[Ahmed S√©kou Tour√©]] whose [[Democratic Party of Guinea-African Democratic Rally]] (PDG) had won 56 of 60 seats in 1957 territorial elections ‚Äì voted overwhelmingly for independence. The French withdrew quickly, and on 2 October 1958, Guinea proclaimed itself a sovereign and independent republic, with S√©kou Tour√© as president.

[[File:Ahmed S√©kou Tour√© na obisku v Ljubljani 1961 (3).jpg|thumb|President [[Ahmed S√©kou Tour√©]] was supported by Communist states and in 1961 visited [[Yugoslavia]].]]

In response to the vote for independence, the French settlers in Guinea were quite dramatic in severing ties with Guinea. ''The Washington Post'' observes how brutal the French were in tearing down all what they thought was their contributions to Guinea: "In reaction, and as a warning to other French-speaking territories, the French pulled out of Guinea over a two-month period, taking everything they could with them. They unscrewed lightbulbs, removed plans for sewage pipelines in Conakry, the capital, and even burned medicines rather than leave them for the Guineans."<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1984/03/28/guineas-longtime-president-ahmed-sekou-toure-dies/18f31685-878c-4759-8028-3bef7fbc568b/</ref>

Guinea subsequently quickly aligned itself with the [[Soviet Union]] and adopted [[Socialism|socialist]] policies. This alliance was short-lived, however, as Guinea moved towards a Chinese model of socialism. Despite this, however, the country continued to receive investment from [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries such as the United States. By 1960, Tour√© had declared the PDG the country's only legal political party and for the next 24 years, the government and the PDG were one.  Tour√© was reelected unopposed to four seven-year terms as president, and every five years voters were presented with a single list of PDG candidates for the National Assembly. Advocating a hybrid [[African Socialism]] domestically and [[Pan-Africanism]] abroad, Tour√© quickly became a polarising leader, and his government became intolerant of dissent, imprisoning thousands and stifling the press.

Throughout the 1960s the Guinean government nationalised land, removed French-appointed and traditional chiefs from power, and had strained ties with the French government and French companies. Tour√©'s government relied on the Soviet Union and China for infrastructure aid and development but much of this was used for political and not economic purposes (such as the building of large stadiums to hold political rallies). Meanwhile, the country's roads, railways and other infrastructure languished and the economy stagnated.

[[File:22novemberdetail.JPG|thumb|Monument to commemorate the 1970 military victory over the Portuguese raid. The only objective not accomplished by the Portuguese raid was the capture of [[Ahmed S√©kou Tour√©]].]]

On 22 November 1970, Portuguese forces from neighboring [[Portuguese Guinea]] staged [[Operation Green Sea]], a raid on Conakry by several hundred exiled Guinean opposition forces. Among their goals, the Portuguese military wanted to kill or capture Sekou Toure due his support of the [[PAIGC]], an independence movement and rebel group that carried out attacks inside Portuguese Guinea from their bases in Guinea.<ref>"Mr Sekou Tour√©, who gave the PAIGC unstinted support during its war against the Portuguese,..."[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13213487 Black revolt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308154755/http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13213487 |date=8 March 2009 }}, [[The Economist]] (22 November 1980)</ref> After fierce fighting, the Portuguese-backed forces retreated, having freed several dozen Portuguese prisoners of war that were being held by the PAIGC in Conakry but without having ousted Tour√©. In the years after the raid, massive purges were carried out by the Tour√© government and at least 50,000 people (1% of Guinea's entire population) were killed. Countless others were imprisoned, faced torture, or, often in the case of foreigners, were forced to leave the country (sometimes after having had their Guinean spouse arrested and their children placed into state custody).

A declining economy, mass killings, a stifling political atmosphere, and a ban on all private economic transactions led in 1977 to the "[[Guinean Market Women's Revolt|Market Women's Revolt]]", anti-government riots that were started by women working in Conakry's [[March√© Madina (Conakry)|Madina Market]]. This caused Tour√© to make major reforms. Tour√© vacillated from supporting the [[Soviet Union]] to supporting the United States. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw some economic reforms but Tour√©'s centralized control of the state remained. Even the relationship with France improved; after the election of [[Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing]] as French president, trade increased and the two countries exchanged diplomatic visits.

S√©kou Tour√© died on 26 March 1984 after a heart operation in the United States, and was replaced by Prime Minister [[Louis Lansana Beavogui]], who was to serve as interim president pending new elections. The PDG was due to elect a new leader on 3 April 1984. Under the constitution, that person would have been the only candidate for president. However, hours before that meeting, Colonels [[Lansana Cont√©]] and [[Diarra Traor√©]] seized power in a bloodless coup. Cont√© assumed the role of president, with Traor√© serving as prime minister until December.

Cont√© immediately denounced the previous regime's record on human rights, released 250 political prisoners and encouraged approximately 200,000 more to return from exile. He also made explicit the turn away from socialism. This did little to alleviate poverty and the country showed no immediate signs of moving towards democracy.

In 1992, Cont√© announced a return to civilian rule, with a presidential poll in 1993 followed by elections to parliament in 1995 (in which his party‚Äîthe [[Party of Unity and Progress]]‚Äîwon 71 of 114 seats.) Despite his stated commitment to democracy, Cont√©'s grip on power remained tight. In September 2001, the opposition leader [[Alpha Cond√©]] was imprisoned for endangering state security, though he was pardoned 8 months later. He subsequently spent a period of exile in France.

In 2001, Cont√© organized and won a referendum to lengthen the presidential term and in 2003 began his third term after elections were boycotted by the opposition. In January 2005, Cont√© survived a suspected assassination attempt while making a rare public appearance in the capital [[Conakry]]. His opponents claimed that he was a "tired dictator"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |title=Welcome Guinea Forum: Cornered, General Lansana Conte can only hope |access-date=23 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616165043/http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |archive-date=16 June 2007  }}</ref> whose departure was inevitable, whereas his supporters believed that he was winning a battle with dissidents.

==Government and politics==
{{Further|Politics of Guinea}}
[[File:Alpha Conde - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Alpha Cond√©]], the current President of Guinea]]
The country is a republic. The president is directly elected by the people and is [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. The unicameral National Assembly is the [[legislative body]] of the country, and its members are directly elected by the people. The judicial branch is led by the Guinea Supreme Court, the highest and final court of appeal in the country.<ref name="reuters.com"/>

Guinea is a member of many international organizations including the [[African Union]], [[Agency for the French-Speaking Community]], [[African Development Bank]], [[Economic Community of West African States]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|World Bank]], [[Islamic Development Bank]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and the United Nations.

===Executive branch===
The [[president of Guinea]] is normally elected by popular vote for a five-year term; the winning candidate must receive a majority of the votes cast to be elected president. The president governs Guinea, assisted by a [[Privy Council|council]] of 25 civilian [[Minister (government)|ministers]] appointed by him. The government administers the country through eight regions, 33 [[prefecture]]s, over 100 [[subprefecture]]s, and many districts (known as [[commune (subnational entity)|commune]]s in [[Conakry]] and other large cities and villages or "quartiers" in the interior). District-level leaders are elected; the president appoints officials to all other levels of the highly centralized administration.

Since the 2010 presidential elections, the head of state has been [[Alpha Cond√©]].

===Legislative branch===
The [[National Assembly of Guinea]], the country's legislative body, did not meet from 2008 to 2013 when it was dissolved after the military coup in December. [[Guinean legislative election, 2013|Elections]] have been postponed many times since 2007. In April 2012, President Cond√© postponed the elections indefinitely, citing the need to ensure that they were "transparent and democratic".<ref name="RNW Africa Desk">{{cite web|title=Guinea president postpones parliamentary elections indefinitely|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/guinea-president-postpones-parliamentary-elections-indefinitely|publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|access-date=22 August 2012|author=RNW Africa Desk|date=28 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430121146/http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/guinea-president-postpones-parliamentary-elections-indefinitely|archive-date=30 April 2012}}</ref>

===Military===
{{Main|Military of Guinea}}
Guinea's armed forces are divided into five branches ‚Äì army, navy, air force, the paramilitary National [[Gendarmerie]] and the Republican Guard ‚Äì whose chiefs report to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is subordinate to the Minister of Defense. In addition, regime security forces include the National Police Force (S√ªret√© National). The Gendarmerie, responsible for internal security, has a strength of several thousand.

The army, with about 15,000 personnel, is by far the largest branch of the armed forces.  It is mainly responsible for protecting the state borders, the security of administered territories, and defending Guinea's national interests. Air force personnel total about 700. The force's equipment includes several Russian-supplied fighter planes and transports. The navy has about 900 personnel and operates several small [[patrol craft]] and barges.

Guinea shares a border with [[Guinea-Bissau]] to [[Guinea‚ÄìGuinea-Bissau border|the north-west]], [[Senegal]] to [[Guinea‚ÄìSenegal border|the north]], [[Mali]] to [[Guinea‚ÄìMali border|the north-east]], [[Ivory Coast]] to [[Guinea‚ÄìIvory Coast border|the east]], [[Sierra Leone]] to [[Guinea‚ÄìSierra Leone border|the south-west]] and [[Liberia]] to [[Guinea‚ÄìLiberia border|the south]]. The nation forms a crescent as it curves from its southeast region to the north and west, to its northwest border with [[Guinea-Bissau]] and southwestern coast on the Atlantic Ocean. The sources of the [[Niger River]], [[Gambia River]], and [[Senegal River]] are all found in the [[Guinea Highlands]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/W4347E/w4347e0h.htm |title=The Senegal River basin |website=Fao.org |access-date=23 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019075901/http://www.fao.org/docrep/W4347E/w4347e0h.htm |archive-date=19 October 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/W4347E/w4347e0i.htm |title=The Niger River basin |website=Fao.org |access-date=23 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721033139/http://www.fao.org/docrep/w4347e/w4347e0i.htm |archive-date=21 July 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/W4347E/w4347e0t.htm |title=The West Coast |website=Fao.org |access-date=23 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011063822/http://www.fao.org/docrep/W4347E/w4347e0t.htm |archive-date=11 October 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

At {{convert|245857|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, Guinea is roughly the size of the United Kingdom. There are {{convert|320|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline and a total land border of {{convert|3400|km|mi|abbr=on}}. It lies mostly between latitudes [[7th parallel north|7¬∞]] and [[13th parallel north|13¬∞N]], and longitudes [[7th meridian west|7¬∞]] and [[15th meridian west|15¬∞W]] (a small area is west of 15¬∞).

Guinea is divided into four main regions: [[Maritime Guinea]], also known as Lower Guinea or the Basse-Cot√© lowlands, populated mainly by the [[Susu people|Susu]] ethnic group; the cooler, mountainous [[Fouta Djallon]] that run roughly north‚Äìsouth through the middle of the country, populated by Fulas, the Sahelian Haute-Guinea to the northeast, populated by [[Mandinka people|Malink√©]], and the forested jungle regions in the southeast, with several ethnic groups. Guinea's mountains are the source for the Niger, the Gambia, and Senegal Rivers, as well as the numerous rivers flowing to the sea on the west side of the range in Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast.

The highest point in Guinea is [[Mount Nimba]] at {{convert|1752|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Although the Guinean and Ivorian sides of the [[Nimba Massif]] are a [[UNESCO]] [[Strict Nature Reserve]], the portion of the so-called Guinean Backbone continues into [[Liberia]], where it has been mined for decades; the damage is quite evident in the [[Nz√©r√©kor√© Region]] at {{Coord|7|32|17|N|8|29|50|W|region:GN_type:landmark}}.

===Regions and prefectures===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Guinea}}
[[File:Guinea Regions.png|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Regions of Guinea]]]]

The Republic of Guinea covers {{convert|245857|km2|sqmi|0}} of West Africa, about [[10th parallel north|10 degrees north]] of the equator. Guinea is divided into four natural regions with distinct human, geographic, and climatic characteristics:

* [[Maritime Guinea]] (''La Guin√©e Maritime'') covers 18% of the country.
* [[Middle Guinea]] (''La Moyenne-Guin√©e'') covers 20% of the country.
* [[Upper Guinea]] (''La Haute-Guin√©e'') covers 38% of the country.
* [[Guin√©e foresti√®re|Forested Guinea]] (''Guin√©e foresti√®re'') covers 23% of the country, and is both forested and mountainous.

Guinea is divided into eight [[Regions of Guinea|administrative regions]] and subdivided into thirty-three [[Prefectures of Guinea|prefectures]]. [[Conakry]] is Guinea's capital, largest city, and economic centre. [[Nz√©r√©kor√©]], located in the [[Guin√©e foresti√®re]] region in Southern Guinea, is the second largest city.

Other major cities in the country with a population above 100,000 include [[Kankan]], [[Kindia]], [[Lab√©|Labe]], [[Gu√©ck√©dou]], [[Bok√©|Boke]], [[Mamou]] and [[Kissidougou]].
* The capital [[Conakry]] with a population of 1,667,864 ranks as a special zone.

== Wildlife ==
{{Main|Wildlife of Guinea|Wildlife of Guinea=}}

The wildlife of Guinea is very diverse due to the wide variety of different habitats. The southern part of the country lies within [[Guinean Forests of West Africa]] [[Biodiversity hotspot]], while the north-east is characterized by dry savanna woodlands. Unfortunately, declining populations of large animals are restricted to uninhabited distant parts of parks and reserves.

=== Taxonomy ===
Species found in Guinea include the following:
* Amphibians : ''[[Hemisus guineensis]]'', ''[[Phrynobatrachus guineensis]]''
* Reptiles : ''[[Acanthodactylus]] guineensis'', ''[[Mochlus]] guineensis''
* Arachnids: ''[[Malloneta guineensis]]'', ''[[Dictyna]] guineensis''
* Insects : ''[[Zorotypus]] guineensis'', ''[[Euchromia guineensis]]''
* Birds: ''[[Melaniparus guineensis]]''

[[File:Kissidougou market.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Kissidougou]] market]]

=== Natural resources ===
Guinea has abundant natural resources including 25% or more of the world's known [[bauxite]] reserves. Guinea also has diamonds, gold, and other metals. The country has great potential for [[hydroelectric power]]. Bauxite and [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]] are currently the only major exports. Other industries include processing plants for beer, juices, soft drinks and tobacco. Agriculture employs 80% of the nation's labor force. Under French rule, and at the beginning of independence, Guinea was a major exporter of bananas, [[pineapples]], coffee, peanuts, and [[palm oil]]. Guinea has considerable potential for growth in the agricultural and fishing sectors. Soil, water, and climatic conditions provide opportunities for large-scale irrigated farming and agro industry.

===Mining===
{{main|Mining industry of Guinea}}

Guinea possesses over 25&nbsp;billion [[tonne]]s (metric tons) of [[bauxite]] ‚Äì and perhaps up to one-half of the world's reserves. In addition, Guinea's mineral wealth includes more than 4-billion tonnes of high-grade iron ore, significant diamond and gold deposits, and undetermined quantities of [[uranium]]. Possibilities for investment and commercial activities exist in all these areas, but Guinea's poorly developed infrastructure and rampant corruption continue to present obstacles to large-scale investment projects.<ref>'How a diamond tycoon lost his shine in 'difficult places' A bribery case goes beyond a mine in Guinea' Article by Rachel Millard in The Sunday Times 25 August 2019. Report on huge corruption in Guinea and the trial of diamond mogul Beny Steinmetz in Switzerland, alleging millions of dollars paid in bribes to Madamie Toure, wife of the late Lansana Conte.</ref>

Joint venture [[bauxite]] mining and alumina operations in northwest Guinea historically provide about 80% of Guinea's [[Foreign exchange reserves|foreign exchange]]. Bauxite is refined into alumina, which is later [[smelting|smelted]] into aluminium.  The ''{{ILL|Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinea|fr}}'' (CBG), which exports about 14 million tonnes of high-grade bauxite annually, is the main player in the bauxite industry. CBG is a joint venture, 49% owned by the Guinean government and 51% by an international consortium known as [[Halco Mining]] Inc., itself a joint venture controlled by aluminium producer [[Alcoa]] (AA), global miner [[Rio Tinto Group]] and Dadco Investments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/metalsNews/idAFL5N0YK4R020150529|title=Guinea bauxite miner CBG plans $1 bln expansion to meet demand|work=Reuters|access-date=23 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010190042/https://af.reuters.com/article/metalsNews/idAFL5N0YK4R020150529|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> CBG has exclusive rights to bauxite reserves and resources in north-western Guinea through 2038.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dadcoalumina.com/about/history.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718025131/http://www.dadcoalumina.com/about/history.aspx |archive-date=18 July 2012  }}</ref> In 2008 protesters upset about poor electrical services blocked the tracks CBG uses.

The ''Compagnie des Bauxites de Kindia'' (CBK), a joint venture between the government of Guinea and [[United Company RUSAL|RUSAL]], produces some 2.5&nbsp;million [[tonne]]s annually, nearly all of which is exported to Russia and Eastern Europe. [[Dian Dian]], a Guinean/[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] joint bauxite venture, has a projected production rate of {{convert|1000000|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} per year, but is not expected to begin operation for several years. The ''[[Alumina Company of Guinea|Alumina Compagnie de Guin√©e]]'' (ACG), which took over the former Friguia Consortium, produced about 2.4&nbsp;million tonnes in 2004 as raw material for its alumina refinery. The refinery exports about 750,000 tonnes of alumina. Both Global Alumina and Alcoa-Alcan have signed conventions with the government of Guinea to build large alumina refineries with a combined capacity of about 4 million tonnes per year.

Diamonds and gold also are mined and exported on a large scale. The bulk of diamonds are mined [[artisanal mining|artisanally]]. The largest gold mining operation in Guinea is a joint venture between the government and [[Ashanti Goldfields]] of [[Ghana]]. AREDOR, a joint diamond-mining venture between the Guinean Government (50%) and an Australian, British, and Swiss [[consortium]], began production in 1984 and mined diamonds that were 90% gem quality. Production stopped from 1993 until 1996, when First City Mining of Canada purchased the international portion of the consortium. Soci√©t√© Mini√®re de Dinguiraye (SMD) also has a large gold mining facility in Lero, near the Malian border.

===Oil===
Guinea signed a [[production sharing agreement]] with Hyperdynamics Corporation of [[Houston]] in 2006 to explore a large offshore tract, and was recently in partnership with [[Dana Petroleum]] PLC ([[Aberdeen]], United Kingdom). The initial well, the Sabu-1, was scheduled to begin drilling in October 2011 at a site in approximately 700&nbsp;meters of water.  The Sabu-1 targeted a four-way [[anticline]] prospect with [[upper Cretaceous]] sands and was anticipated to be drilled to a total depth of 3,600&nbsp;meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://investors.hyperdynamics.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=600343 |title=Hyperdynamics Corporation ‚Äì Jasper Explorer Drill Ship En Route to Hyperdynamics' First Exploration Drilling Site Offshore Guinea |website=Investors.hyperdynamics.com |access-date=23 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914023859/http://investors.hyperdynamics.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=600343 |archive-date=14 September 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Following the completion of exploratory [[drilling]] in 2012, the Sabu-1 well was not deemed commercially viable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offshore-technology.com/news/newshyperdynamics-completes-drilling-of-sabu-1-well-offshore-guinea-conakry|title=Hyperdynamics completes drilling at Sabu-1 well offshore Guinea-Conakry|website=Offshore-technology.com|access-date=3 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203115227/http://www.offshore-technology.com/news/newshyperdynamics-completes-drilling-of-sabu-1-well-offshore-guinea-conakry|archive-date=3 February 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In November 2012, Hyperdynamics subsidiary SCS reached an agreement for a sale of 40% of the concession to [[Tullow Oil]], bringing ownership shares in the Guinea offshore tract to 37% Hyperdynamics, 40% Tullow Oil, and 23% Dana Petroleum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tullowoil.com/index.asp?pageid=137&newsid=805|title=Tullow Oil Agrees Farm-in to Guinea Concession|website=Tullowoil.com|access-date=3 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203120232/http://www.tullowoil.com/index.asp?pageid=137&newsid=805|archive-date=3 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Hyperdynamics will have until September 2016 under the current agreement to begin drilling its next selected site, the Fatala [[Cenomanian]] [[turbidite]] fan prospect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperdynamics.com/guinea_project.htm|title=Overview of the Guinea Project|website=Hyperdynamics.com|author1=Hyperdynamics|access-date=3 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203114454/http://www.hyperdynamics.com/guinea_project.htm|archive-date=3 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>

=== Agriculture ===
The majority of Guineans work in the agriculture sector, which employs approximately 75% of the country. The rice is cultivated in the flooded zones between streams and rivers. However, the local production of rice is not sufficient to feed the country, so rice is imported from Asia. The [[agriculture in Guinea|agriculture sector of Guinea]] cultivates coffee beans, pineapples, peaches, nectarines, [[mango]]es, oranges, bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, pepper, and many other types of produce. Guinea is one of the emerging regional producers of apples and pears. There are many plantations of grapes, pomegranates, and recent years have seen the development of strawberry plantations based on the vertical hydroponic system.

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Le "Voile" de la mari√©e √† Kindia.png|thumb|Le "Voile" de la mari√©e √† Kindia]]
Due to its diverse geography, Guinea presents some interesting tourist sites. Among the top attractions are the waterfalls found mostly in the Basse Guinee (Lower Guinea) and Moyenne Guinee (Middle Guinea) regions. The Soumba cascade at the foot of Mount Kakoulima in Kindia, Voile de la Mari√©e (bride's veil) in Dubreka, the Kinkon cascades that are about {{Convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}} high on the Kokoula River in the prefecture of Pita, the Kambadaga falls that can reach {{Convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} during the rainy season on the same river, the Ditinn & Mitty waterfalls in Dalaba, and the Fetor√© waterfalls and the stone bridge in the region of Labe are among the most well-known water-related tourist sites.

==Problems and reforms==
In 2002, the [[IMF]] suspended Guinea's [[Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility]] (PRGF) because the government failed to meet key performance criteria. In reviews of the PRGF, the World Bank noted that Guinea had met its spending goals in targeted social priority sectors. However, spending in other areas, primarily defense, contributed to a significant fiscal deficit.<ref>{{Cite book|last=International Business Publications, USA|title=Guinea Investment and Business Guide, Volume 1: Strategic and Practical Information|location=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wj6zDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|pages=28}}</ref> The loss of IMF funds forced the government to finance its debts through [[Central Bank]] advances. The pursuit of unsound economic policies has resulted in imbalances that are proving hard to correct.

Under then-Prime Minister Diallo, the government began a rigorous reform agenda in December 2004 designed to return Guinea to a PRGF with the IMF. Exchange rates have been allowed to float, price controls on gasoline have been loosened, and government spending has been reduced while tax collection has been improved. These reforms have not reduced inflation, which hit 27% in 2004 and 30% in 2005. [[Currency depreciation]] is also a concern. The Guinea franc was trading at 2550 to the dollar in January 2005. It hit 5554 to the dollar by October 2006. In August 2016 that number had reached 9089.

Despite the opening in 2005 of a new road connecting Guinea and Mali, most major roadways remain in poor repair, slowing the delivery of goods to local markets. Electricity and water shortages are frequent and sustained, and many businesses are forced to use expensive power generators and fuel to stay open.

Even though there are many problems plaguing Guinea's economy, not all foreign investors are reluctant to come to Guinea. Global Alumina's proposed alumina refinery has a price tag above $2&nbsp;billion. Alcoa and Alcan are proposing a slightly smaller refinery worth about $1.5&nbsp;billion. Taken together, they represent the largest private investment in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] since the [[Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project|Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline]]. Also, Hyperdynamics Corporation, an American oil company, signed an agreement in 2006 to develop Guinea's offshore [[Senegal River|Senegal Basin]] oil deposits in a concession of {{convert|31000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}; it is pursuing seismic exploration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperdynamics.com/media/HDY-JV-Partner-Opportunity-Brochure-082208.pdf|title=Joint Venture Opportunity Offshore the West Coast of Africa|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207130218/http://www.hyperdynamics.com/media/HDY-JV-Partner-Opportunity-Brochure-082208.pdf|archive-date=7 February 2009}}Hyperdynamics Corporation (2008)</ref>

On 13 October 2009, Guinean Mines Minister Mahmoud Thiam announced that the [[China International Fund]] would invest more than $7bn (¬£4.5bn) in infrastructure. In return, he said the firm would be a "strategic partner" in all mining projects in the mineral-rich nation. He said the firm would help build ports, railway lines, power plants, low-cost housing and even a new administrative centre in the capital, [[Conakry]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Guinea confirms huge China deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8304418.stm|date=13 October 2009|access-date=13 October 2009|work=BBC News|location=London|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20091015040614/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8304418.stm|archive-date=15 October 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> In September 2011, Mohamed Lamine Fofana, the Mines Minister following the [[Guinean presidential election, 2010|2010 election]], said that the government had overturned the agreement by the ex-military junta.<ref name="bbcmines">{{cite news|title=Guinea mining: PM defends radical industry shake-up|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14915121|publisher=BBC|date=14 September 2011|access-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027214243/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14915121|archive-date=27 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Youth unemployment remains a large problem. Guinea needs an adequate policy to address the concerns of urban youth. One problem is the disparity between their life and what they see on television. For youth who cannot find jobs, seeing the economic power and consumerism of richer countries only serves to frustrate them further.<ref>[http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/171240/index.en.shtml Joschka Philipps, "Explosive youth: Focus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526044412/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/171240/index.en.shtml |date=26 May 2010 }}, D+C (Development and Cooperation), funded by Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development,(2010/05) pages 190‚Äì193].

===Mining controversies===
Guinea has large reserves of the steel-making raw material, iron ore. [[Rio Tinto Group]] was the majority owner of the $6&nbsp;billion [[Simandou]] iron ore project, which it had called the world's best unexploited resource.

</ref> Domestic air services are intermittent. Most vehicles in Guinea are 20+ years old, and cabs are any four-door vehicle which the owner has designated as being for hire.

There is some river traffic on the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Milo River|Milo]] rivers. Horses and donkeys pull carts, primarily to transport construction materials.

==Health==
{{Further|Health in Guinea}}

===Ebola===
{{Further|Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa}}
In 2014, there was an outbreak of the [[Ebola virus epidemic in Guinea|Ebola virus in Guinea]]. In response, the health ministry banned [[Bushmeat|the sale and consumption of bats]], thought to be carriers of the disease. Despite this measure, the virus eventually spread from rural areas to [[Conakry]],<ref>{{cite news |date= 28 March 2014 |title= Ebola: Guinea outbreak reaches capital Conakry |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26774343 |publisher= BBC |access-date= 30 March 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140330024741/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26774343 |archive-date= 30 March 2014 |url-status= live |df= dmy-all }}</ref> and by late June 2014 had spread to neighboring countries [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]]. In early August 2014 Guinea closed its borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia to help contain the spreading of the virus, as more new cases of the disease were being reported in those countries than in Guinea.

The outbreak began in early December, in a village called Meliandou, southeastern Guinea, not far from the borders with both Liberia and Sierra Leone. The first known case was a two-year-old child who died, after fever and vomiting and passing black stool, on 6 December. The child's mother died a week later, then a sister and a grandmother, all with symptoms that included fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Then, by way of caregiving visits or attendance at funerals, the outbreak spread to other villages.

Unsafe burials remained one of the primary sources of the transmission of the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the inability to engage with local communities hindered the ability of health workers to trace the origins and strains of the virus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-4-march-2015|title=Ebola Situation Report ‚Äì 4 March 2015 {{!}} Ebola|website=apps.who.int|access-date=14 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301084553/http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-4-march-2015|archive-date=1 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The epidemic also affected the treatment of other diseases in Guinea. There was a decline in healthcare visits by the population due to fear of being infected and mistrust in the health care system, and a decrease in the system's ability to provide routine health care and HIV/AIDS treatments due to the Ebola outbreak.<ref>[http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(15)60713-9.pdf] {{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref>

HIV is spread primarily through multiple-partner heterosexual intercourse. Men and women are at nearly equal risk for HIV, with young people aged 15 to 24 most vulnerable. Surveillance figures from 2001 to 2002 show high rates among commercial sex workers (42%), active military personnel (6.6%), truck drivers and bush taxi drivers (7.3%), miners (4.7%), and adults with tuberculosis (8.6%).<ref name=usaid/>

Several factors are fueling the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Guinea. They include unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners, illiteracy, endemic poverty, unstable borders, refugee migration, lack of civic responsibility, and scarce medical care and public services.<ref name=usaid/>

===Malnutrition===
[[Malnutrition]] is a serious problem for Guinea. A 2012 study reported high chronic malnutrition rates, with levels ranging from 34% to 40% by region, as well as acute malnutrition rates above 10% in Upper Guinea's mining zones. The survey showed that 139,200 children suffer from acute malnutrition, 609,696 from chronic malnutrition and further 1,592,892 suffer from anemia. Degradation of care practices, limited access to medical services, inadequate hygiene practices and a lack of food diversity explain these levels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/eb/wfpdoc062106.pdf |title=Enqu√™te nationale nutrition-sant√©, bas√©e sur la m√©thodologie SMART, 2011‚Äì2012 |access-date=12 May 2014 |year=2012 |publisher=World Food Programme }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
