{{Status of religious freedom|expanded=concepts}}
A '''secular state''' is an idea pertaining to [[secularity]], whereby a [[State (polity)|state]] is or purports to be officially neutral in matters of [[religion]], supporting neither religion nor [[irreligion]].<ref name="MadeleyEnyedi2003">{{cite book|author-first1=John T. S.|author-last1=Madeley|author-first2=Zsolt|author-last2=Enyedi|title=Church and State in Contemporary Europe: The Chimera of Neutrality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n5Brda6FmswC|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7146-5394-5|page=14}}</ref> A secular state claims to treat all its citizens equally regardless of religion, and claims to avoid preferential treatment for a citizen based on their religious beliefs, affiliation or lack of either over those with other profiles.

Secular states do not have a [[state religion]] (e.g., an established religion) or an equivalent, although the absence of an established state religion does not necessarily imply that a state is fully secular or egalitarian in all respects. For example, some states that describe themselves as secular have [[Religion in national symbols|religious references in their national anthems and flags]], or laws which advantage one religion or another.

==Origin and practice==
Secularity can be established at a state's creation (e.g., the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United States|United States of America]], the [[Republic of India]]) or by it later [[secularization|secularizing]] (e.g., [[France]] or [[Nepal]]). Movements for ''[[laïcité]]'' in France and [[separation of church and state]] in the United States have defined modern concepts of secularism, the United States of America being the first explicitly secular nation both in Western and world history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slader.com/discussion/question/which-nation-was-the-first-secular-nation-in-the-history/|title=Which nation was the first secular nation in history?}}</ref> Historically, the process of secularizing typically involves granting religious freedom, disestablishing state religions, stopping public funds being used for a religion, freeing the legal system from religious control, freeing up the education system, tolerating citizens who change religion or abstain from religion, and allowing political leadership to come to power regardless of their religious beliefs.<ref>Jean Baubérot [http://www.ambafrance-us.org/atoz/secular.asp The secular principle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222013645/http://www.ambafrance-us.org/atoz/secular.asp |date=22 February 2008 }}</ref>

In France, Italy and Spain, for example, official holidays for the public administration tend to be Christian [[feast day]]s. Any private school in France that contracts with ''Éducation nationale'' means its teachers are salaried by the state—most of the [[Catholic school]]s are in this situation and, because of history, they are the majority; however, any other religious or non-religious schools also contract this way.<ref>Richard Teese, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1188531 Private Schools in France: Evolution of a System], ''[[Comparative Education Review]]'', Vol. 30, No. 2 (May 1986), pp. 247–59</ref> In some European states where secularism confronts [[monoculturalism|monoculturalist]] [[philanthropy]], some of the main [[Christianity#Major groupings within Christianity|Christian sects]] and [[List of religions and spiritual traditions|sects of other religions]] depend on the state for some of the financial resources for their [[Private foundation (United States)|religious charities]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Twinch|first=Emily|title=Religious charities: Faith, funding and the state|url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/Article/914534/religious-charities-faith-funding-state/|work=Article dated 22 June 2009|publisher=Third Sector – a UK Charity Periodical|accessdate=3 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510221443/http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/Article/914534/religious-charities-faith-funding-state/|archivedate=10 May 2013}}</ref> It is common in [[corporate law]] and [[charity law]] to prohibit [[organized religion]] from using those funds to organize religious worship in a separate [[place of worship]] or for [[Religious conversion|conversion]]; the religious body itself must provide the religious content, educated clergy and [[layperson]]s to exercise its own functions and may choose to devote part of their time to the separate charities. To that effect some of those charities establish secular organizations that manage part of or all of the donations from the main religious bodies.

Religious and non-religious organizations can apply for equivalent funding from the government and receive subsidies based on either assessed social results{{clarify|date=February 2017}} where there is indirect religious state funding, or simply the number of [[beneficiary|beneficiaries]] of those organisations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/|title=Department for Education|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> This resembles [[charitable choice]] in the United States. It is doubtful whether overt direct state funding of religions is in accordance with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. Apparently this issue has not yet been decided at supranational level in [[European Court of Human Rights|ECtHR case law]] stemming from the rights in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], which mandates [[non-discrimination]] in affording its co-listed basic social rights.{{clarify|date=February 2017}}{{Fix|text=gobbledegook}} Specifically, funding certain services would not accord with non-discriminatory state action.<ref>[Sejdic and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (application nos. 27996/06 and 34836/06) found a violation of the non-discrimination overarching right [[wikt:vis-à-vis|vis-à-vis]] all other rights on a wider subject from often arbitrary funding of social charities viz. rights afforded by law Art. 1 of Prot. No. 12, namely protecting "any right set forth by law".{{clarify|date=February 2017}}{{Fix|text=plain English please}} The convention introduces a general prohibition of discrimination in legally enshrined state action, as well as where rights under the convention such as an education or health care are funded. A superior level of services supported by religious bodies is permitted.]</ref>

Many states that are nowadays secular in practice may have legal vestiges of an earlier [[established religion]]. Secularism also has various guises that may coincide with some degree of official religiosity. In the United Kingdom, the head of state is still required to take the [[Coronation Oath Act 1688|Coronation Oath enacted in 1688]], swearing to maintain the Protestant Reformed religion and to preserve the established [[Church of England]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/royaleventsandceremonies/coronation/coronation.aspx|title=Coronation Oath|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> The UK also maintains seats in the [[House of Lords]] for 26 senior clergymen of the Church of England, known as the [[Lords Spiritual]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/lords/whos-in-the-house-of-lords/members-and-their-roles/how-members-are-appointed/#jump-link-3|title=How members are appointed|work=UK Parliament|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> In Canada the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] affords secular freedoms of conscience and religion, thought, belief, opinion and expression, including communication, assembly and association yet the [[Preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter's preamble]] maintains the concept of "the supremacy of God" which would appear to disadvantage those who hold [[nontheism|nontheistic]] or [[polytheism|polytheistic]] beliefs, including [[atheism]] and [[Buddhism]].<ref>Hogg, Peter W.  ''Canada Act 1982 Annotated''.  Toronto, Canada:  The Carswell Company Limited, 1982.</ref><ref>[http://www.academia.edu/16378297/_The_supremacy_of_God_does_not_belong_in_the_Constitution_ ''Paul Russell''], "The supremacy of God" does not belong in the Constitution": The Globe & Mail, June 11, 1999</ref> Italy has been a secular state since 1985 but still recognizes a special status for the Catholic Church. The reverse progression can also occur, however; a state can go from being secular to being a [[state religion|religious state]], as in the case of [[Iran]] where the secularized [[Pahlavi dynasty|Imperial State of Iran]] was replaced by an [[Islamic Republic]] (list below). Nonetheless, the last 250 years has seen a trend towards secularism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/news/allnewsbydate.asp?NewsID=1131 |title=Harris Interactive: Resource Not Found |accessdate=18 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723125147/http://www.harrisinteractive.com/news/allnewsbydate.asp?NewsID=1131 |archivedate=23 July 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=300|title=A Portrait of "Generation Next"|date=9 January 2007|work=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11240/Secularization-Secularism-History-Nature-Secularization-Secularism-1914.html|title=Secularization and Secularism – History and Nature of Secularization and Secularism to 1914|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref>

***In Article 6 it is mentioned "1 All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people...". 
***Article 12, item 8 instructs the President to make the following declaration: "In the presence of Almighty God I do solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that I will maintain the Constitution of Ireland and uphold its laws, that I will fulfil my duties faithfully and conscientiously in accordance with the Constitution and the law, and that I will dedicate my abilities to the service and welfare of the people of Ireland.

***Article 31, item 4 establishes that every member of the Council of State subscribe the following declaration: "In the presence of Almighty God I do solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that I will faithfully and conscientiously fulfil my duties as a member of the Council of State". 
***Article 34, item 6 establishes that every person appointed a judge under this Constitution shall make and subscribe the following declaration: "In the presence of Almighty God I do solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my knowledge and power execute the office of Chief Justice (or as the case may be) without fear or favour, affection or ill-will towards any man, and that I will uphold the Constitution and the laws.

* {{Flag|Israel|size=23px}}
**When the idea of [[Types of Zionism|modern political Zionism]] was introduced by [[Theodor Herzl]], his idea was that Israel would be a secular state which would not be influenced at all by religion. When [[David Ben-Gurion]] founded the state of Israel, he put religious parties in government next to secular Jews in the same governing coalition. Many secular Israelis feel constrained by the religious sanctions imposed on them. Many businesses close on [[Shabbat]], including many forms of public transportation, restaurants, and Israeli airline [[El Al]]. In order for a Jewish couple to be formally married in Israel, a couple has to be married by a [[rabbi]]. Jewish married couples can only be divorced by a rabbinical council. Many secular Israelis may go abroad to be married, often in Cyprus. Marriages officiated abroad are recognized as official marriages in Israel. Also, all food at army bases and in cafeterias of government buildings has to be [[kosher]]. Many religious symbols have found their way into Israeli national symbols. For example, the flag of the country is similar to a [[tallit]], or prayer shawl, with its blue stripes. The national coat of arms also displays the [[menorah (Temple)|menorah]]. However, some viewpoints argue that these symbols can be interpreted as ethnic/cultural symbols too, and point out that many secular European nations (Sweden, Georgia, and Turkey) have religious symbols on their flags. Reports have considered Israel to be a secular state, and its definition as a "Jewish state" refers to the [[Jewish people]], who include people with varying relations to the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]] including non-believers, rather than to the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]] itself.<ref>[https://www.iclrs.org/content/blurb/files/Israel.pdf Religion and the Secular State in Israel]. Page 421-422: " Not every Jew, in Israel or elsewhere, is a religious individual. It is in collective terms that religion has been an essential ingredient in the self-definition and behavior of the Jews, believers or not, observant or not. For that reason, it was aptly stated that Judaism conceived of itself not as a denomination but as the religious dimension of the life of a people. Hence peoplehood is a religious fact in the Jewish universe of discourse. In its traditional self-understanding, Israel is related not to other denominations but to the “‟nations of the world‟… Israel‟s… body is the body politic of a nation. a denomination but as the religious dimension of the life of a people. Hence peoplehood is a religious fact in the Jewish universe of discourse. In its traditional self-understanding, Israel is related not to other denominations but to the “‟nations of the world‟… Israel‟s… body is the body politic of a nation". Page 423: "It seems reasonable to accept that the reference to Israel as a “Jewish State” is equivalent to stating that in historical, political, and legal terms, it is the state of the Jewish people". Page 424: "all refer to a Jewish state, and Jewish means, in all of them, pertaining to Jews, namely the individuals seeing themselves as composing the Jewish people, or nation, or community. It clearly does not mean the body of religious precepts, commands or convictions regulated by the Halakha, the Jewish religious law developed over centuries.".</ref>

**The [[Constitution of Nauru]] opens by stating that "the people of Nauru acknowledge God as the almighty and everlasting Lord and the giver of all good things". However, there is no state religion or established church, and article 11 of the Constitution protects each person's "right to freedom of conscience, thought and religion, including freedom to change his religion or beliefs and freedom", and right to practice his or her religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ronlaw.gov.nr/nauru_lpms/Links/constitution.html|title=THE CONSTITUTION OF NAURU*|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref>
* {{flag|Nepal|size=23px}}
**The [[Constitution of Nepal]] provides freedom of religion and denies the right to convert another person. The previous constitution of 1990, which was in effect until 2007, described the country as a "Hindu Kingdom". With the new Constitution, the Interim Parliament officially declared the country a secular state in January 2007, but no laws specifically affecting [[Freedom of religion in Nepal|freedom of religion]] were changed. Adherents of the country's many [[Religion in Nepal|religious groups]] generally coexisted peacefully and respected places of worship, although there were reports of societal abuses and discrimination based on religious belief or practice. Those who converted to another religious group at times faced violence and occasionally were ostracized socially but generally did not fear to admit their affiliations in public.<ref> Article 4 of the [https://constituteproject.org/constitution/Nepal_2016.pdf?lang=en Nepal's Constitution of 2015 with Amendments through 2016], constituteproject.org, Article 4: "Nepal is an independent, indivisible, sovereign, secular, inclusive democratic, socialism-oriented federal democratic republican state."

* {{flag|Norway|size=23px}}
**Norway changed the wording of the constitution on 21 May 2012, to remove references to the state church. Until 2017, the [[Church of Norway]] was not a separate legal entity from the government. In 2017, it was disestablished and became a [[national church]], a legally distinct entity from the state with special constitutional status. The King of Norway is required by the Constitution to be a member of the Church of Norway, and the church is regulated by a special canon law, unlike other religions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/state-and-church-move-towards-greater-separation-norway|title=International Humanist and Ethical Union - State and Church move towards greater separation in Norway|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015|date=26 June 2012}}</ref>
* {{flag|Romania|size=23px}}
**The Romanian constitution declares freedom of religion, but all recognized religious denominations remain to some extent state-funded. Since 1992, these denominations have also maintained a monopoly on the sale of religious merchandise, which includes all candles except decorative candles and candles for marriage and baptism. It is currently illegal in Romania to sell cult candles without the approval of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] or of another religious denomination which employs candles (law 103/1992, appended O.U.G. nr.92/2000 to specify penalties).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legeaz.net/text-integral/legea-103-1992-dreptul-exclusiv-al-cultelor-religioase-producerea-obiectelor-de-cult|title=Legea 103/1992 dreptul exclusiv al cultelor religioase pentru producerea obiectelor de cult - Textul integral al legilor|publisher=}}</ref> Romania recognizes 18 denominations/religions: various sects of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the [[Catholic Church]], [[Protestantism]] and [[Neoprotestantism|Neo-Protestantism]] (including [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]), [[Judaism]] and [[Sunni Islam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://culte.gov.ro/?page_id=57|title=Culte Religioase – Secretariatul de Stat pentru Culte|website=culte.gov.ro}}</ref> Unrecognized cults or denominations are not prohibited, however.

However, Article 9 of Chapter 2, which states "The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place, and accordingly, it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana" makes Sri Lanka an ambiguous state with respect to secularism. In 2004, [[Jathika Hela Urumaya]] proposed a constitutional amendment that would make a clear reference to Buddhism as the state religion, which was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka]].<ref name="SecularvsBuddhism">Temperman (2010), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Khag6tbsIn4C&pg=PA66&dq=%22patronise+and+protect+Buddhism%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1kcjUe24H4P9rAe-0oDQDg&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22patronise%20and%20protect%20Buddhism%22&f=false p. 66]</ref>

Article 6 provides that "the [[Sabbath]] Day shall be kept holy", and prohibits any "commercial undertaking" on that day. Article 5 provides: "All men are free to practice their religion and to worship God as they may deem fit in accordance with the dictates of their own worship consciences and to assemble for religious service in such places as they may appoint".

**The [[Church of England]] is the established state religion of [[England]] only. It is no longer established in [[Northern Ireland]] or [[Wales]] and the Anglican Church in these regions ([[Church of Ireland]] and [[Church in Wales]], respectively) became autonomous from the Church of England in 1871 and 1920, respectively. In [[Scotland]], the generally Protestant [[Church of Scotland]] has an ambiguous, special constitutional status as [[national church]]. Furthermore, unlike its Welsh and Irish counterparts, the Anglican Church in Scotland (the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]]) never had established status. 
***Like the Church of Ireland and Church in Wales, the Scottish Episcopal Church is autonomous from the Church of England. All, however, are still in [[Anglican Communion|full communion]].
**Two archbishops and 24 senior [[Diocese|diocesan]] bishops of the Church of England (the [[Lords Spiritual]]) have seats in the [[House of Lords]], where they participate in debates and vote on decisions affecting the entire [[United Kingdom]]. 
***Parliament is opened with prayers, led by a Lords Spiritual member in the House of Lords and the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]]'s chaplain in the House of Commons.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/g07.pdf Some Traditions and Customs of the House], House of Commons Information Office, August 2010.</ref> 
**The full term for the expression of the Crown's sovereignty via legislation is [[Queen-in-Parliament|the Crown-in-Parliament under God]]. At their coronation, the sovereign is anointed with consecrated oil by the Archbishop of Canterbury in a service at [[Westminster Abbey]] and must swear to maintain the [[Divine law|Laws of God]] and the true profession of the [[Gospel]], maintain [[Protestantism]] in the United Kingdom, specifically the Church of England, and the doctrine, worship, discipline, and government thereof as by established law in England. 
***Thus, though the [[Church of Ireland]] is no longer established and the [[Church of England]] has been [[Disestablishmentarianism|disestablished]] in Wales as the [[Church in Wales]], the Crown is still bound to protect Protestantism in general in the whole of the United Kingdom by the [[Coronation Oath Act 1688]] and the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]], and to protect the [[Church of Scotland]] by the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union 1707]].<ref>[https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00435/SN00435.pdf The Coronation Oath], House of Commons Library, 27 August 2008.</ref> All Members of Parliament (MPs) must declare their allegiance to the Queen in order to take their seat. Each individual MP, however, can choose whether or not to affirm a religious oath.

While the Constitution of the United States of America guarantees Freedom of religion and freedom of association, as per a 1956 act of Congress the official [[United States motto]] has been changed to “In God we trust“. Prior to this act of Congress, the official motto of the United States had been “E Pleribus Unum” or “out of many, one” since the country’s creation. Additionally, the motto of “In God we trust“ has been printed on their currency since 1864.<ref> [http://www.treasury.gov/about/education/Pages/in-god-we-trust.aspx] </ref>
