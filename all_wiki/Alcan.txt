'''Alcan''' was a Canadian mining company and [[aluminum]] manufacturer. It was founded in 1902 as the Northern Aluminum Company, renamed '''Aluminum Company of Canada''' in 1925, and '''Alcan Aluminum''' in 1966. It took the name Alcan Incorporated in 2001. During that time, it grew to become one of the world's largest aluminum manufacturers.

Alcan was purchased by Australian-British multinational [[Rio Tinto (corporation)|Rio Tinto]] for $38 billion in 2007, becoming [[Rio Tinto Alcan]] Inc. in 2008. It was headquartered in [[Montreal]], in its [[Maison Alcan]] complex.<ref>{{cite book|title=Maison Alcan|publisher=Lonely Planet|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/montreal/sights/architecture/maison-alcan}}</ref>

== History ==
The Northern Aluminium Company Limited was founded in 1902, in [[Shawinigan]], [[Quebec]], as part of the [[Pittsburgh Reduction Company]]. In 1913, the company opened a kitchen utensil production plant and foundry in [[Toronto]]. It opened a [[rolling mill]] in the plant a few years later.

During [[World War I]] (1914–18), aluminium production shot to 131,000 tonnes from 69,000.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jean Simard |url=http://www.aac.aluminium.qc.ca/e403.html#date_1 |title=Home - Dialogue Sur L'Aluminium |publisher=Aac.aluminium.qc.ca |accessdate=2012-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903022730/http://www.aac.aluminium.qc.ca/e403.html#date_1 |archive-date=2011-09-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1925, the company was renamed the Aluminium Company of Canada. The Aluminium Company of Canada was responsible for rapid development in [[Arvida]], today a part of the city of [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]] in Quebec, by contributing to the construction of major ports and railway facilities. It began production at its sheet rolling and extrusion facility in [[Ontario]] in 1940.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jean Simard |url=http://www.aac.aluminium.qc.ca/e403.html#date_2 |title=Home - Dialogue Sur L'Aluminium |publisher=Aac.aluminium.qc.ca |accessdate=2012-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903022730/http://www.aac.aluminium.qc.ca/e403.html#date_2 |archive-date=2011-09-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1931, the Northern Aluminium Co. Ltd. or Alcan Industries Ltd. pig and rolled Aluminium factory was opened on land acquired in 1929 in the then hamlet of [[Hardwick, West Oxfordshire]], England. The factory helped build parts for [[Spitfire]] fighter aircraft during [[World War II]].<ref name="oxfordmail.co.uk">[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/yourtown/banbury/4533488.End_of.../ End of the line for Banbury's Alcan factory ''[[Oxford Mail]]'' August 6, 2009</ref> The [[Alcan Laboratories Club]] was founded in 1948 by the lab technicians to promote the well-being of the workforce in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=24966494746|title=Log In or Sign Up to View|publisher=}}</ref> As a result, the village began to grow. By the early 1950s, the local economy had become dependent on the plant's prosperity, with 24% of the town's workers being employed there. At this time 13% were employed in distribution, 7% in clothing and 5% in agriculture.<ref name="british-history.ac.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63792|title=Banbury: Economic history - British History Online|publisher=}}</ref>

With the onset of World War II, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' demand for aluminum expanded rapidly, and with it the company. Already encompassing roughly three-quarters of the production capacity for aluminum in the [[British Empire]], the company's "assets increased fivefold; sales increased fivefold; net income increased sixfold" between 1937 and 1944, according to a report on commissioned by the [[Government of Canada]].<ref name="CanadianEncyclopedia">{{cite web|last1=Block|first1=Niko|title=Alcan Incorporated|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alcan-aluminium-limited/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=16 February 2017|date=6 February 2006}}</ref> The governments of the UK, Canada, the United States, and Australia facilitated this growth with low-interest loans and tax deferrals.<ref name="CanadianEncyclopedia"/>

In 1945, the Aluminium Company of Canada was officially registered under the trade name Alcan.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jean Simard |url=http://www.aac.aluminium.qc.ca/e403.html#date_4 |title=Home - Dialogue Sur L'Aluminium |publisher=Aac.aluminium.qc.ca |accessdate=2012-12-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903022730/http://www.aac.aluminium.qc.ca/e403.html |archivedate=September 3, 2011 }}</ref> Sales fell substantially in the immediate aftermath of the War, but rebounded with postwar expansion, as aluminum was increasingly in use in construction, by electrical utilities, and in  manufacturing.<ref name="CanadianEncyclopedia"/> In 1951, it initiated a $500-million project at [[Kitimat, British Columbia]], the largest public-private partnership ever introduced in Canada at the time.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jean Simard |url=http://www.aac.aluminium.qc.ca/e403.html#date_5 |title=Home - Dialogue Sur L'Aluminium |publisher=Aac.aluminium.qc.ca |accessdate=2012-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903022730/http://www.aac.aluminium.qc.ca/e403.html#date_5 |archive-date=2011-09-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Despite a June 1950 antitrust ruling that forced shareholders divest themselves of shares in either Aluminum Limited (as the company was then known) or Alcoa, and the rise of American rivals [[Kaiser Aluminum|Kaiser]] and [[Reynolds Group Holdings|Reynolds]], Alcan remained a dominant player in the aluminum sector for many subsequent decades.<ref name="CanadianEncyclopedia"/>

In 1994 Alcan sold their building products unit (with a plant in [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]]) to [[Genstar Capital]] and the location later closed and demolished.

Between 1998 and 2001, the [[Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean]] became the largest construction site in North America, as Alcan undertook a $3-billion construction project in [[Alma, Quebec|Alma]] with a yearly production capacity of 400,000 metric tonnes. In 2000, Alcan acquired [[Algroup]] (Alusuisse Group Ltd.), merging the companies to become Alcan, Inc. in 2001. Alcan became the second biggest primary aluminium production company. It then became the world's largest aluminium manufacturer in 2004 after acquiring the [[Pechiney]] Group, the fourth player in worldwide production and fabrication of aluminium and the number three in packaging.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jean Simard |url=http://www.aac.aluminium.qc.ca/e403.html#date_7 |title=Home - Dialogue Sur L'Aluminium |publisher=Aac.aluminium.qc.ca |accessdate=2012-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903022730/http://www.aac.aluminium.qc.ca/e403.html#date_7 |archive-date=2011-09-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Acquisition===
In 2007, [[Rio Tinto (corporation)|Rio Tinto]] acquired Alcan, in a US$38 billion deal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/rio-tinto-agrees-to-acquire-alcan-for-381-billion-in-cash|title=Rio Tinto to buy Alcan for $38 billion|last=Goldstein|first=Steve|date=2007-07-12|website=MarketWatch|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> The offer served to undermine a hostile bid of $27.5bn from [[Alcoa]], Alcan's US rival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3664a78c-3005-11dc-a68f-0000779fd2ac|title=Rio Tinto in $44bn takeover of Alcan|last=Bream|first=Rebecca|last2=Simon|first2=Bernard|date=2007-07-12|website=Financial TImes|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-11}}</ref> Rio Tinto became the world's leading aluminum producer. Rio Tinto quickly announced its intention to sell off the Engineered Products and Packaging business groups. Alcan Incorporated was amalgamated with Rio Tinto Canada Holding Incorporated and renamed [[Rio Tinto Alcan]] Incorporated in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riotinto.com/media/18435_media_releases_6859.asp |title=Media releases - Rio Tinto Offer for Alcan - additional shares acquired |publisher=Rio Tinto |accessdate=2012-12-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930162351/http://www.riotinto.com/media/18435_media_releases_6859.asp |archivedate=2011-09-30 }}</ref>

The various Alcan facilities on the 53-acre site in Oxfordshire closed between 2006 and 2007, and the factory and laboratory were demolished over the course of 2008–2009.<ref name="oxfordmail.co.uk"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CF97RE8oZDE|title=Alcan 1931 - 2008|first=|last=Phil B|date=31 July 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/37166458@N06/3977254123/|title=Alcan, Banbury|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.banburyguardian.co.uk/news/former_alcan_site_sold_1_1102777|title=Former Alcan site sold|publisher=}}</ref>

In 2010, Alcan Packaging was sold to [[Amcor]], Alcan Composites was sold to Schweiter Technologies and Alcan Food Packaging was sold to [[Bemis Company|Bemis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law360.com/articles/174329/doj-requires-divestiture-for-amcor-s-2b-alcan-buy |title=DOJ Requires Divestiture For Amcor's $2B Alcan Buy |publisher=Law360 |date= |accessdate=2016-04-23}}</ref>

In 2011, Rio Tinto sold [[Apollo Global Management]] and FSI ([[Fonds stratégique d'investissement]]) shareholdings of 51% and 10% respectively of Alcan Engineered Products (excluding Cable).
