== Career ==

In 2006, Paisner collaborated with [[Holly Robinson Peete]] on the book ''Get Your Own Damn Beer, I'm Watching the Game!: A Woman's Guide to Loving Pro Football'', which won that year's [[Quill Award]] in the Sports category.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 2nd Annual Quill Awards|url=http://www.hollywood.com/tv/the-2nd-annual-quill-awards-59521439/credits/|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}</ref>

In 2011, Paisner collaborated with baseball umpire [[Jim Joyce]] and pitcher [[Armando Galarraga]] on a book about [[Armando_Galarraga's_near-perfect_game|Galarraga's near perfect game]].  On June 2, 2010, Joyce called a play incorrectly, preventing Galarraga from pitching a perfect game.  Following the release of the book, ''Nobody's Perfect:  Two Men, One Call, and a Game for Baseball History'', [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] did not allow Joyce to work any games in which Galarraga would be playing, to avoid any appearance of impropriety due to their business relationship.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=6617450|title=MLB will not let Jim Joyce umpire Armando Gallaraga's games|last=Nelson|first=Amy|date=June 1, 2011|work=espn.com|accessdate=January 12, 2019}}</ref>
