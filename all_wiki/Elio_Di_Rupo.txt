'''Elio Di Rupo''' ({{IPA-fr|eljo di ʁupo|lang}};<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forvo.com/word/elio_di_rupo/#fr |title=Elio Di Rupo pronunciation: How to pronounce Elio Di Rupo in Italian, French, Dutch |publisher=Forvo.com |date=1 December 2011 |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> born 18 July 1951) is a Belgian [[Social Democracy|social-democratic]] politician who is the 15th [[Minister-President of Wallonia]]. He served as the 50th [[Prime Minister of Belgium]] from 6 December 2011 to 11 October 2014, and headed the [[Di Rupo Government]]. Di Rupo was the first [[francophone]] to hold the office since [[Paul Vanden Boeynants]] in 1979,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/world/europe/belgium-forms-government-with-elio-di-rupo-as-premier.html?_r=0 |title=18 Months After Vote, Belgium Has Government |newspaper=NYTimes.com |date=2011-12-01 |accessdate=2014-11-19 |first=Stephen |last=Castle}}</ref> and the country's first socialist Prime Minister since [[Edmond Leburton]] left office in 1974. He was also Belgium's first Prime Minister of non-Belgian descent, and the world's [[List of the first LGBT holders of political offices|second openly gay person and first openly gay man to be head of government]] in modern times.

==Background and early life==
Di Rupo is the son of two [[Italians]]. His father was born in [[San Valentino in Abruzzo Citeriore]]. Elio, who was born in the small town of [[Morlanwelz]], in [[Wallonia]], was the only one of the children to be born in Belgium;<ref>{{cite news| title=Profile: Belgium's Elio Di Rupo | author=Patrick Jackson| work=BBC News| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15983739| date=5 December 2011}}</ref> his brothers and sisters were all born in Italy. When he was one year old, his father died in a car crash and his mother was unable to raise all seven children. Due to the poor financial state of his family, three of his brothers were raised in a nearby orphanage.<ref name="BBC profile"/>

When he was 12, he attended boarding school. Due to medical issues, Di Rupo had to re-do his first year of high school twice, but eventually excelled in science at the end of his high school years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hoe Elio Di Rupo doctor in de chemie werd|author=Francis Van de Woestyne|publisher=Vacature|url=http://www.vacature.com/blog/hoe-elio-di-rupo-doctor-in-de-chemie-werd|date=30 November 2011|access-date=27 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184659/http://www.vacature.com/blog/hoe-elio-di-rupo-doctor-in-de-chemie-werd|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> This led him to pursue a degree in [[chemistry]] at the [[University of Mons]], where he eventually obtained a [[PhD]] in Chemistry, after being a part-time lecturer at [[Leeds University]] as well.

==Political career==
Di Rupo came in contact with the socialist movement for the first time during his studies in [[Mons]], where he first obtained a master's degree and afterwards a PhD in [[chemistry]]. He went during the preparation of his doctorate to the [[University of Leeds]] (United Kingdom), where his function was that of lecture member of staff in 1977–1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premier.be/en/biography|title=Biography &#124; Elio Di Rupo|publisher=Premier.be|date=18 July 1951|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>

He started his political career as an [[Attaché#Belgium|attaché]] at the cabinet of [[Jean-Maurice Dehousse]] in 1980–81. His first political mandate came in 1982, when he was Councillor of [[Mons]] (until 1985, and again from 1988 until 2000). In 1986, he was mayor of health, urban renewal and social affairs. Professionally, Di Rupo was at the same time cabinet member and then Deputy Head of Cabinet of the minister of finance of that time of the Walloon region and consequently Deputy Head of Cabinet of the minister of finance and energy of the Walloon region at that time [[Philippe Busquin]] (1981–85) and superintendent of the energy-inspection of the ministry of the Walloon region.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

He is a deputy (MP) for the [[Arrondissement of Mons]] in the [[Belgian Chamber of Representatives]]. He once described [[François Mitterrand]] as being "a character from a novel".<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.lalibre.be/article.phtml?id=10&subid=90&art_id=113309&folder_id=125 Elio, tout simplement], article from [[La Libre Belgique]], 22 April 2003</ref>

In 2000, he became the mayor of [[Mons]],<ref name="FT profile"/> which is the capital of the province of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]].

In 1987, he got his national political breakthrough. He was elected as member of the [[Chamber of Deputies]] and went two years later for a short time to the [[European Parliament]].

In 1991, Di Rupo was chosen as a senator, but shortly afterwards (1992), he took in the French-speaking community his first ministerial function in Education and later also Media. These were his responsibilities until [[Guy Coëme]], who was mentioned in the [[Agusta scandal|Agusta-scandal]], resigned and Di Rupo went to the federal government in 1994 as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Traffic and Governmental companies. Following the elections in 1995, he remained the Vice-Prime Minister of Belgium and was appointed minister of Economics and Telecommunications. In 1995 he signed the merger of the Belgian airline Sabena with Swiss Air that eventually led to the bankruptcy of Sabena with thousands of unemployed employees as result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.lesoir.be/sabena-daems-eclabousse-di-rupo-transport-aerien-dans-u_t-20021009-Z0MCQM.html|title=Archives - lesoir.be |publisher=Archives.lesoir.be|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>

In 1996, at the time of the [[Marc Dutroux|Dutroux affair]], Olivier Trusgnach, a prostitute, alleged that Di Rupo paid him for sex while Trusgnach was still a minor.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/gays-under-pressure-in-belgiums-moral-backlash-anger-over-child-murders-switches-to-belgiums-gays-1354281.html |title=Gays under pressure in Belgium's moral backlash: Anger over child murders switches to Belgium's gays|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=26 November 1996|accessdate=16 June 2015 |location=London |first=Sarah |last=Helm}}</ref> This accusation could have meant the end of his political career. Di Rupo denied the accusations.

After the federal and regional elections of June 1999 in which, due to the [[Dioxin Affair]], the [[Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams|Christian-Democrats]] lost many of their votes, Di Rupo negotiated with the Flemish socialists of [[Socialistische Partij Anders|sp.a]], the [[VLD|Liberals]] and [[Groen!|Green Party]] to form a "purple-green" government. Di Rupo himself was in charge of the function of minister-president of the Walloon region, but already in October of the same year the members of the party chose him as president and in April 2000, he was succeeded in his function of minister-president by [[Jean-Claude Van Cauwenberghe]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

As new president of the party, Di Rupo was forced to make a generation change within the PS and go down a new path. During the regional and federal elections of 1995 and 1999, the PS lost many of its votes, partly because of [[corruption in Belgium|corruption]] scandals in the 1990s (named [[Agusta scandal|Agusta-scandal]] and UNIOP-affair), in which the most prominent PS-politicians were involved. PS had been in the government subsequently since 1988 (in the regional government and in the federal government), but the liberal PRL (now [[Mouvement Réformateur|MR]]) became in the 1999-elections as strong as the PS. Apart from those two, [[Ecolo]] also became an important political party. Di Rupo realised that drastic action was required to regain the position of the PS. By several measures, such as "Contrat d'avenir pour la Wallonie" (Contract for the Future of Wallonia) and a new generation of party leaders, by which [[Marie Arena]] was important, he tried to reassemble the left wing-forces around him. Successfully, because in the elections of 2003, PS regained the electoral score of 1991 and was by far the most important political party before [[Mouvement Réformateur|MR]]. During the regional elections of 2004, it also became the most important party in the Brussels capital region.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[File:Elio di Rupo-15-12-2007.jpg|thumb|Di Rupo in 2007]]
Di Rupo changed, in 2004, the liberal coalition partner for the Christian-democratic party, in the Walloon Government and in the Brussels Capital Government (in the last also the green party Ecolo was part of the government). By doing this, coalitions were made which differed from the federal coalition at that time. In October 2005, he became [[List of Ministers-President of the Walloon Region|Minister-President of the Walloon Region]]<ref name="FT profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/536893f0-1c47-11e2-a63b-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3JVd2hNWR|title=Elio di Rupo: Belgium's unlikely prime minister|publisher=FT.com|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref> after [[Jean-Claude Van Cauwenberghe]] resigned amid a corruption scandal, involving several members of Di Rupo's party. He continued as party leader though and has had to deal with the PS's [[ICDI affair]] that emerged in May 2006.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In 2006 and 2007, Di Rupo and his party appeared unsuccessful in trying to clean out corruption. This was probably instrumental in the party's losing its first place amongst [[French Community of Belgium|French community]] parties [[2007 Belgian general election|2007 federal election]].<ref>The party lost 20% of its seats at the Chamber of Representatives, see also [http://socialistworld.net/eng/2007/06/22belg.html this article] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930022204/http://socialistworld.net/eng/2007/06/22belg.html |date=30 September 2007 }} that analyses the impact on socialists</ref> Di Rupo then decided to take a firmer stance against corruption in Charleroi: he virtually took control of the city's Socialist Party and ordered the Socialist mayor and [[alderman|aldermen]] to resign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/cm/flandersnews.be/News/2.728/070611_charleroi|title=deredactie.be|publisher=Vrtnieuws.net|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Belga|url=http://www.lalibre.be/article.phtml?id=10&subid=90&art_id=353750 |title=Démission du collège communal|publisher=La Libre.be|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>

After former PS president [[Guy Spitaels]] urged him to choose between the presidency of the party and of the [[Walloon Region]], Di Rupo decided to organise internal elections for party president in July 2007 rather than in October of that year and announced that he would resign from his mandate as Minister-President if re-elected. On 11 July 2007, he was re-elected president of the Socialist Party with 89.5% of the votes.<ref>{{cite web|author=BELGA|url=http://www.lalibre.be/article.phtml?id=10&subid=90&art_id=359215|title=Elio Di Rupo est réélu|publisher=La Libre.be|date=12 July 2007|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>

Following the [[2010 Belgian general election]], in which the PS emerged as the largest of the Francophone parties and the second largest political party in Belgium, speculation emerged as to whether Di Rupo could be the Prime Minister in a [[2010 Belgian government formation|new government]]. The [[RTBF]] raised questions, however, about whether Di Rupo's limited fluency in Dutch would be a stumbling block in seeking that office; every prime minister since 1979 had been a [[Flemish people|Fleming]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In May 2011, he was appointed [[Formateur]] by the Belgian king, which gave Di Rupo the task of forming a government. Traditionally, the Formateur also becomes the Prime Minister of the government he forms. He became prime minister of the [[Di Rupo I Government]] on 6 December 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=DMF20111206_064|title=Regering Di Rupo I legt de eed af|date=6 December 2011|accessdate=6 December 2011|work=[[De Standaard]]|language=nl}}</ref>

With Di Rupo's appointment, Belgium ended 589 days without a government, believed to be the longest such streak ever for a country in the developed world. [[Yves Leterme]] had resigned on 26 April 2010 and had been serving as caretaker prime minister since then.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/06/world/europe/belgium-government/index.html|title=Belgium ends record-breaking government-free run|publisher=CNN.com|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>

==Board of directors==
Between 2004 and 2005, Elio Di Rupo was on the [[board of directors]] of what was then [[Dexia]] bank, currently [[Belfius]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dexia.com/FR/actionnaires_investisseurs/actionnaires_individuels/publications/Documents/rapport_annuel_2005_fr.pdf|title=Page 111: Monsieur Elio Di Rupo, qui avait été coopté par le conseil d’administration de Dexia SA le 16 novembre 2004.

==Personal life==
Di Rupo describes himself as an "[[atheist]], [[rationalist]], and [[Freemason]]."<ref name="BBC profile"/> He is fluent in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]. After becoming Prime Minister, he took [[Dutch language|Dutch]] lessons to address his previous limited fluency in the language and this improved enough for him to be able to address the parliament in Dutch and conduct TV interviews in the language.<ref>{{cite web|title=Elio Di Rupo is tweetalig (zegt zijn leraar Nederlands)|url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/elio-di-rupo-is-tweetalig-zegt-zijn-leraar-nederlands/article-4000163747612.htm|publisher=Knack.be|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref>

Di Rupo [[Coming out|came out]] as gay in 1996, and when asked by a confrontational "media pack" if he was gay, he responded, "Yes.
