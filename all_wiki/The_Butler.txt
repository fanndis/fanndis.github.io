==Plot==
<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->

In 2009, an elderly Cecil Gaines [[Frame story|recounts]] his life story while waiting at the [[White House]] to meet the newly inaugurated president.
In 1926, at the age of seven, Gaines is raised on a [[Plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States|cotton plantation]] in [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. When the farm's owner [[rape]]s his mother, Hattie, his father, Earl confronts him and is killed. Cecil is taken in by the estate's caretaker, who trains Cecil as a house servant.

In 1937, at the age of eighteen, Cecil leaves the plantation. Desperately hungry, he breaks into a hotel pastry shop. The elderly master servant, Maynard, takes pity on Cecil and gives him a job. Cecil learns advanced serving and interpersonal skills from Maynard, who later recommends Cecil for a position in a [[Washington, D.C.]] hotel. While working there, Cecil meets and marries Gloria, and the couple has two sons: Louis and Charlie.

In 1957, Cecil is hired by the [[White House]] during [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s administration. White House [[maître d'hôtel]] Freddie Fallows introduces Cecil to head butler Carter Wilson and co-worker James Holloway. Cecil witnesses Eisenhower's reluctance to use troops to enforce school desegregation, then his resolve to uphold the law by [[Little Rock Nine|racially integrating]] [[Little Rock Central High School]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Arkansas]].

Louis, the elder son, becomes a university student at [[Fisk University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], although Cecil feels that the [[Deep South|South]] is too volatile. Louis joins a student program led by [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) activist [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], which leads to a [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] [[sit-in]] at a [[Nashville sit-ins|segregated diner]], where he is arrested. Gloria, who feels that Cecil puts his job ahead of her, descends into [[alcoholism]].

In 1961, after [[John F. Kennedy]]'s inauguration, Louis and [[Freedom Riders|others]] are attacked by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] while on a [[Freedom Riders|freedom ride]] to [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Louis participates in the 1963 [[Birmingham Campaign|Birmingham Children's Crusade]], where dogs and water cannons are used to stop the marchers, one of the movement's actions which inspires Kennedy to deliver [[Civil Rights Address|a national address]] proposing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. After Kennedy is [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]], his successor, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], enacts the legislation. As a goodwill gesture, [[Jackie Kennedy]] gives Cecil one of the former president's [[necktie]]s.

Louis participates in the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma Voting Rights Movement]], which inspires Johnson to demand that Congress enact the landmark [[1965 Voting Rights Act|Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. Johnson also gives Cecil a [[tie bar]].

In the late 1960s, after civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|assassination]], Louis tells his family that he has joined the [[Black Panthers]]. Cecil orders Louis and his girlfriend to leave his house. Louis is arrested again. Cecil becomes aware of President [[Richard Nixon]]'s plans to suppress the Black Panthers.

Charlie confides to Louis that he plans to join the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]]. After enlisting, Charlie is killed and buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. When the Black Panthers resort to violence, Louis leaves the organization and returns to college, earning his [[master's degree]] in [[political science]] and eventually running for a seat in [[United States Congress|Congress]], although Cecil continues to hold resentment against him.

Cecil repeatedly confronts his supervisor at the White House over the unequal pay and career advancement provided to the black White House staff. With President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s support, Cecil prevails, his reputation growing to the point that he and his wife are invited by the Reagans to be guests at a state dinner. Cecil becomes uncomfortable with the class divisions in the White House. After witnessing Reagan's refusal to support [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act|economic sanctions]] against Apartheid [[South Africa]], Cecil resigns.

Gloria encourages Cecil to mend his relationship with Louis. Realizing his son's actions are heroic, Cecil joins Louis at a protest against [[Apartheid in South Africa|South African apartheid]]; they are arrested and jailed together.

In 2008, Gloria dies shortly before [[Barack Obama]] [[2008 United States presidential election|is elected]] as the nation's first Black president. Two months, two weeks and one day later, Cecil prepares to meet the newly [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] President, wearing the articles he received from Kennedy and Johnson. White House Chief Usher [[Stephen W. Rochon]] approaches Cecil and tells him the president is ready, preparing to show him the way to the Oval Office. Cecil tells him that he knows the way.

==Production==
===Development===
[[Danny Strong]]'s screenplay is inspired by Wil Haygood's ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article "A Butler Well Served by This Election".<ref name="wapost">{{cite news |last=Haygood |first=Wil |title=A Butler Well Served by This Election|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/06/AR2008110603948_pf.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 7, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=The Reliable Source | date= August 6, 2013 | title= No, President Obama isn't doing a cameo in 'The Butler' | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/08/06/no-president-obama-isnt-doing-a-cameo-in-the-butler/ |department=Reliable Source (blog) | work=[[The Washington Post]] | access-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref> The project received initial backing in early 2011, when producers Laura Ziskin and Pam Williams approached [[Sheila Johnson]] for help in financing the film. After reading Danny Strong's screenplay, Johnson pitched in her own $2.7 million before bringing in several African-American investors. However, Ziskin died from cancer in June 2011. This left director Daniels and producing partner Hilary Shor to look for further producers on their own. They started with [[Cassian Elwes]], with whom they were working on [[The Paperboy (2012 film)|''The Paperboy'']]. Elwes joined the list of producers, and started raising funding for the film. In spring 2012, AI Film, a British financing and production company, added a $6 million guarantee against foreign pre-sales. Finally the film raised its needed $30 million budget through 41 producers and executive producers, including Earl W. Stafford, Harry I. Martin Jr., Brett Johnson, [[Michael Finley]], and Buddy Patrick. Thereafter, as film production started [[Weinstein Co.]] picked up U.S. distribution rights for the film. David Glasser, Weinstein Co. COO, called fund raising as an independent film, "a story that's a movie within itself."<ref name=holly13>{{cite web| title = Why 'Lee Daniels' The Butler' Has 41 Producers| url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-lee-daniels-butler-has-605011|date=August 14, 2013| access-date = August 15, 2013|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>

[[The Weinstein Company]] acquired the distribution rights for the film after [[Columbia Pictures]] put the film in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Brevet |first=Brad |title=New Look at 'The Butler' as the Weinstein Co.

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] started in June 2012 in [[New Orleans]].  Interior White House scenes were shot at Second Line Stages. Production was originally scheduled to wrap in early August 2012 but was delayed by the impact of [[Hurricane Isaac (2012)|Hurricane Isaac]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Mike|title=Tropical Storm Isaac chases 'The Butler' away, as film suspends production|url=http://www.nola.com/movies/index.ssf/2012/08/tropical_storm_isaac_chases_th.html|newspaper=The Times-Picayune|date=August 27, 2012}}</ref>

===Historical accuracy===
Regarding historical accuracy, Eliana Dockterman wrote in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'': "Allen was born on a [[Virginia]] plantation in 1919, not in Georgia.... In the movie, Cecil Gaines grows up on a cotton field in Macon, where his family comes into conflict with the white farmers for whom they work. What befalls his parents on the cotton field was [[Stereotypes of African Americans|added for dramatic effect]].... Though tension between father and son over civil rights issues fuels most of the drama in the film, [Eugene Allen's son] Charles Allen was not the radical political activist that Gaines's son is in the movie."<ref>{{cite news|last=Dockterman |first=Eliana |title=The True Story of The Butler: Fact vs. Fiction in Lee Daniels' The Butler |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/08/16/what-the-butler-really-saw/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 16, 2013}}</ref>

Particular criticism has been directed at the film's accuracy in portraying President [[Ronald Reagan]]. While Alan Rickman's performance generated positive reviews, the director and screenwriters of the film have been criticized for depicting Reagan as indifferent to civil rights and his reluctance to associate with the White House's black employees during his presidency. According to [[Michael Reagan]], the former president's son, "The real story of the White House butler doesn't imply racism at all. It's simply Hollywood liberals wanting to believe something about my father that was never there."<ref>{{cite news|last=Bond|first=Paul|title=President Reagan's Son Attacks 'Lee Daniels' The Butler'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/president-reagans-son-attacks-lee-614568 |access-date=August 28, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 26, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Child|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/29/the-butler-ronald-reagan-not-racist|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|title=The Butler falsely portrays Ronald Reagan as racist, says son|date=August 29, 2013|access-date=September 1, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|website=[[Newsmax]]|title=The Butler from Another Planet|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Reagan/Butler-Reagan-Oprah-Allen/2013/08/22/id/521814|date=August 27, 2013|first=Michael|last=Reagan|access-date=December 25, 2013}}</ref>

[[Paul Kengor]], one of President Reagan's biographers, also attacked the film, saying, "I've talked to many White House staff, cooks, housekeepers, doctors, and Secret Service over the years. They are universal in their love of Ronald Reagan." In regard to the president's initial opposition to sanctions against [[apartheid]] in South Africa, Kengor said, "Ronald Reagan was appalled by apartheid, but also wanted to ensure that if the apartheid regime collapsed in South Africa that it wasn't replaced by a [[Marxist]]-[[totalitarian]] regime allied with [[Moscow]] and [[Cuba]] that would take the South African people down the same road as [[Ethiopia]], [[Mozambique]], and, yes, Cuba. In the immediate years before Reagan became president, 11 countries from the Third World, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, went [[Communist]]. It was devastating. If the film refuses to deal with this issue with the necessary balance, it shouldn't deal with it at all."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lee-daniels-butler-reagan-biographers-608233|title=Lee Daniels' 'The Butler': Reagan Biographers Slam President's Portrayal|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 16, 2013|access-date=September 1, 2013}}</ref>
