In a positive review, [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], writing for [[AllMusic]], said "All the songs make sense narratively and on their own, so they hold together well and would amount to a first-rate soundtrack", but criticized the dialogue included in the album.<ref name=AllMusicreview/> ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s Brittany Spanos gave the soundtrack four stars out of a possible five, saying "The music Gaga helps write for this stretch in Ally’s career...is gorgeous--romantic without being trite and powerful."<ref name=RollingStonereview/> Nick Reilly of ''[[NME]]'' complimented the album's "emotionally charged songs that feel entirely appropriate for this heartfelt tale of doomed romance", adding that the album is "one of the best Hollywood soundtracks of recent years."<ref name=NMEreview/>

Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', [[Neil McCormick]] gave the album a moderately positive review, saying the soundtrack was enjoyable, but criticized the "slightly awkward journey from rock balladry to slickly superficial pop" and stated that "there is also a weird disconnect as the soundtrack shifts gear to anodyne modern pop".<ref name="Telegraph"/> Jeremy Winograd of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'', in a mixed review, was critical of the album, saying "There’s undoubtedly a strong 10-song album lodged at the core of A Star Is Born, but unlike the film, wherein an outsized sense of sentimentality is rendered affecting by the more grounded performances, there’s not nearly enough substance here to justify all the bombast."<ref name="Slant"/>
