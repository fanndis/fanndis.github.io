The '''United States Capitol''', often called the '''Capitol Building''', is the meeting place of the [[United States Congress]] and the [[Seat of government|seat]] of the [[Legislative branch of the United States federal government|legislative branch]] of the [[U.S. federal government]]. It is located on [[Capitol Hill]] at the eastern end of the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Though no longer at the geographic center of the [[Geography of Washington, D.C.|federal district]], the Capitol forms the origin point for the district's street-numbering system and the [[Quadrants of Washington, D.C.|district's four quadrants]].

The original building was completed in 1800. Although the Capitol was temporarily rendered unusable as a consequence of the 1814 [[burning of Washington]], the building was fully restored within five years. The building was later enlarged, with the addition of a massive [[United States Capitol dome|dome]], and extended wings with expanded chambers for the [[bicameral]] legislature, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the south wing and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in the north wing. Like the principal buildings of the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches, the Capitol is built in a distinctive [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]] and has a white exterior. Both its east and west elevations are formally referred to as ''fronts'', though only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries.

===Background===
{{See also|History of Washington, D.C.|List of National Historical Landmarks in Washington, D.C.|List of capitals in the United States#Capitals of the United States}}

Prior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the [[United States Congress]] and its predecessors had met in [[Philadelphia]] ([[Independence Hall]] and [[Congress Hall]]), New York City ([[Federal Hall]]), and a number of other locations ([[York, Pennsylvania]]; [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]; the [[Maryland State House]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]]; and [[Nassau Hall]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]).<ref>See [[List of capitals in the United States]]</ref> In September 1774, the [[First Continental Congress]] brought together delegates from the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] in Philadelphia, followed by the [[Second Continental Congress]], which met from May 1775 to March 1781.

After adopting the [[Articles of Confederation]] in [[York, Pennsylvania]], the [[Congress of the Confederation]] was formed and convened in Philadelphia from March 1781 until June 1783, when a mob of angry soldiers converged upon [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]], demanding payment for their service during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Congress requested that [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]], the [[Governor of Pennsylvania]], call up the [[Militia (United States)|militia]] to defend Congress from attacks by the protesters. In what became known as the [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783]], Dickinson sympathized with the protesters and refused to remove them from Philadelphia. As a result, Congress was forced to flee to [[Princeton, New Jersey]], on June 21, 1783,<ref>{{cite book | last=Crew | first=Harvey W. |author2=William Bensing Webb |author3=John Wooldridge  | title=Centennial History of the City of Washington, D. C. | publisher=United Brethren Publishing House | year=1892 | location=[[Dayton, Ohio]] | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_5Q81AAAAIAAJ | page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_5Q81AAAAIAAJ/page/n73 66]}}</ref> and met in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], and [[Trenton, New Jersey]], before ending up in New York City.

The [[United States Congress]] was established upon [[History of the United States Constitution|ratification]] of the [[United States Constitution]] and formally began on March 4, 1789. New York City remained home to Congress until July 1790,<ref>Allen (2001), p. 4</ref> when the [[Residence Act]] was passed to pave the way for a permanent capital. The decision of where to locate the capital was contentious, but [[Alexander Hamilton]] helped broker a compromise in which the federal government would take on war debt incurred during the American Revolutionary War, in exchange for support from [[Northeastern United States|northern states]] for locating the capital along the [[Potomac River]]. As part of the legislation, Philadelphia was chosen as a temporary capital for ten years (until December 1800), until the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., would be ready.<ref>Allen (2001), p. 4–7</ref>

[[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]] was given the task of creating the city plan for the new capital city.<ref>L'Enfant identified himself as "Peter Charles L'Enfant" during most of his life, while residing in the United States. He wrote this name on his [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3850.ct000512 "Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of t(he) United States ...."] (Washington, D.C.) and on other legal documents. However, during the early 1900s, a French ambassador to the U.S., [[Jean Jules Jusserand]], popularized the use of L'Enfant's birth name, "Pierre Charles L'Enfant". (Reference: Bowling, Kenneth R (2002). ''Peter Charles L'Enfant: vision, honor, and male friendship in the early American Republic.'' George Washington University, Washington, D.C. {{ISBN|978-0-9727611-0-9}}). The [[United States Code]] states in {{USC|40|3309}}: "(a) In General.—The purposes of this chapter shall be carried out in the District of Columbia as nearly as may be practicable in harmony with the plan of Peter Charles L'Enfant." The [[National Park Service]] identifies L'Enfant as "[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/Wash/text.htm#washington Major Peter Charles L'Enfant]" and as "[http://www.nps.gov/history/Nr/travel/presidents/washington_monument.html Major Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant]" on its website.</ref> L'Enfant chose Jenkin's Hill as the site for the "Congress House", with a "grand avenue" (now [[Pennsylvania Avenue]], NW) connecting it with the [[White House|President's House]], and a public space containing a broader "grand avenue" (now the National Mall) stretching westward to the Potomac River (see: [[L'Enfant Plan]]).<ref name=Kornwolf>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bHwImC-UOUC&pg=PA1522|page=1552|title=The Creation of the Federal City: Washington|work=Architecture and Town Planning in Colonial North America: Vol. 3|first1=James D|last1=Kornwolf|first2=Georgiana Wallis|last2=Kornwolf|location=Baltimore, Maryland|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2002|isbn=0801859867|oclc=	45066419|accessdate=October 29, 2016|quote=A final legacy of Jefferson's vision of the city is found in correspondence between him and L'Enfant.

====Name====
In reviewing L'Enfant's plan, [[Thomas Jefferson]] insisted the legislative building be called the "Capitol" rather than "Congress House".<ref name=Kornwolf/> The word "Capitol" comes from [[Latin]] and is associated with the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus]] on [[Capitoline Hill]], one of the [[seven hills of Rome]].<ref>{{OEtymD|Capitol}}</ref><ref>Allen (2001), p. 10</ref> The connection between the two is not clear.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Naming the Capitol and the Capital |first=George W. |last=Hodgkins |journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society, Washington, D.C. |volume=60/62 |year=1960 |pages=36–53 |jstor=40067217}}</ref> In addition to coming up with a city plan, L'Enfant had been tasked with designing the Capitol and President's House; however, he was dismissed in February 1792 over disagreements with [[President of the United States|President]] [[George Washington]] and the commissioners, and there were no plans at that point for the Capitol.<ref>Allen (2001), p. 11</ref>

The word "capitol" has since been adopted, following the example of the United States Capitol, in many jurisdictions also for other government buildings, for instance the "capitols" in the individual capitals of the states of the United States. This, in turn, has led to frequent misspellings of "capitol" and "capital". The former refers to a building which houses government institutions; the latter refers to the entire city.<ref>http://www.merriam-webster.com, entries "capitol" and "capital".</ref>

===Design competition===
[[File:Capitol design by james diamond.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Design for the U.S. Capitol, "An Elevation for a Capitol", by James Diamond was one of many submitted in the 1792 contest, but not selected.]]

In spring 1792, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed a design competition to solicit designs for the Capitol and the [[White House|"President's House"]], and set a four-month deadline. The prize for the competition was $500 and a lot in the Federal City. At least ten individuals submitted designs for the Capitol; however the drawings were regarded as crude and amateurish, reflecting the level of architectural skill present in the United States at the time.<ref>Allen (2001), p. 13–15</ref> The most promising of the submissions was by [[Étienne Sulpice Hallet|Stephen Hallet]], a trained French architect.<ref>Frary (1969), p. 28</ref> However, Hallet's designs were overly fancy, with too much French influence, and were deemed too costly.<ref>Allen (2001), p. 18</ref>

[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Thornton Capitol Winning Design.jpg|thumb|The winning design for the U.S. Capitol, submitted by William Thornton]]
A late entry by amateur architect [[William Thornton]] was submitted on January 31, 1793, to much praise for its "Grandeur, Simplicity, and Beauty" by Washington, along with praise from Thomas Jefferson. Thornton was inspired by the [[east front of the Louvre]], as well as the [[Pantheon, Paris|Paris Pantheon]] for the center portion of the design.<ref>Allen (2001), p. 19</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/adecenter/essays/B-Thornton.html | title= William Thornton (1759–1828) | publisher=Library of Congress | accessdate=July 7, 2007}}</ref> Thornton's design was officially approved in a letter dated April 5, 1793, from Washington, and Thornton served as the first [[Architect of the Capitol]] (and later first Superintendent of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]).<ref>Frary (1969), p. 33</ref> In an effort to console Hallet, the commissioners appointed him to review Thornton's plans, develop cost estimates, and serve as superintendent of construction. Hallet proceeded to pick apart and make drastic changes to Thornton's design, which he saw as costly to build and problematic.<ref>Frary (1969), p. 34–35</ref> In July 1793, Jefferson convened a five-member commission, bringing Hallet and Thornton together, along with [[James Hoban]] (winning architect of the [[White House|"President's Palace"]]) to address problems with and revise Thornton's plan. Hallet suggested changes to the floor plan, which could be fitted within the exterior design by Thornton.<ref name="Allen 2001, p. 23">Allen (2001), p. 23</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefThom.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&tag=public&part=178&division=div2 | work=Thomas Jefferson and the National Capital | title=Letter: Jefferson to Washington | date=July 17, 1793 | author=Jefferson, Thomas | publisher=University of Virginia | accessdate=December 11, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221135738/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=JefThom.sgm&images=images%2Fmodeng&data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&tag=public&part=178&division=div2 | archive-date=February 21, 2011 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> The revised plan was accepted, except that [[Thomas Jefferson|Secretary Jefferson]] and [[George Washington|President Washington]] insisted on an open [[Alcove (architecture)|recess]] in the center of the East front, which was part of Thornton's original plan.<ref>Frary (1969), p. 36</ref>

The original design by Thornton was later modified by the famous British-American architects [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Sr.]], and then [[Charles Bulfinch]].<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web | title=United States Capitol, Washington, D.C.: East Front Elevation, Rendering | url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/17 | publisher=[[World Digital Library]] | accessdate=February 13, 2013}}</ref> The [[United States Capitol dome|current cast-iron dome]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House's new southern extension]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] new northern wing were designed by [[Thomas Ustick Walter]] and [[August Schoenborn]], a [[Germans|German]] immigrant, in the 1850s,<ref>{{cite web | last=Woods | first=Robert O. | url=http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/features/capdome/capdome.html | title=Under the Capitol Dome | work=Mechanical Engineering Magazine | publisher=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers | date=June 2003 | accessdate=December 11, 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126092928/http://www.memagazine.org/contents/current/features/capdome/capdome.html | archivedate=January 26, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> and were completed under the supervision of [[Edward Clark (architect)|Edward Clark]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/capitol/capitol_construction.cfm | title=A Brief Construction History of the Capitol | publisher=Architect of the Capitol | accessdate=December 11, 2008}}</ref>

===Construction===
[[File:USCapitol1800.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Capitol when first occupied by Congress (painting circa 1800 by [[William Russell Birch]])]]

L'Enfant secured the lease of [[Quarry|quarries]] at [[Public Quarry at Government Island|Wigginton Island]] and along [[Aquia Creek]] in [[Virginia]] for use in the [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]]s and outer walls of the Capitol in November 1791.<ref name="morgan-p120">{{cite journal | author=Morgan, J.D. | title=Maj.

Construction proceeded with Hallet working under supervision of [[James Hoban]], who was also busy working on construction of the [[White House|"President's House"]] (also later known as the "Executive Mansion"). Despite the wishes of Jefferson and the President, Hallet went ahead anyway and modified Thornton's design for the East Front and created a square central court that projected from the center, with flanking wings which would house the legislative bodies. Hallet was dismissed by Secretary Jefferson on November 15, 1794.<ref>Frary (1969), p. 37–39</ref> [[George Hadfield (architect)|George Hadfield]] was hired on October 15, 1795, as Superintendent of Construction, but resigned three years later in May 1798, because of his dissatisfaction with Thornton's plan and quality of work done thus far.<ref>Frary (1969), p. 44–45</ref>

The [[United States Senate|Senate]] (north) wing was completed in 1800. The Senate and House shared quarters in the north wing until a temporary wooden pavilion was erected on the future site of the House wing which served for a few years for the Representatives to meet in, until the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (south) wing was finally completed in 1811, with a covered wooden temporary walkway connecting the two wings with the Congressional chambers where the future center section with rotunda and dome would eventually be. However, the House of Representatives moved early into their House wing in 1807. Though the Senate wing building was incomplete, the Capitol held its [[History of the United States Congress|first session]] of the [[United States Congress]] with both chambers in session on November 17, 1800. The National Legislature was moved to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] prematurely, at the urging of President [[John Adams]], in hopes of securing enough [[Southern United States|Southern]] votes in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] to be re-elected for a second term as president.<ref name="carter-p139">{{cite journal | author=Carter II, Edward C. | title=Benjamin Henry Latrobe and the Growth and Development of Washington, 1798–1818 | journal=Records of the Columbia Historical Society | date=1971–1972 | page=139}}</ref>

===Early religious use===
For several decades, beginning when the federal government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, the Capitol building was used for Sunday religious services as well as for governmental functions. The first services were conducted in the "hall" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the "Oven", which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Then, from 1807 to 1857, they were held in the then-House Chamber (now called [[Statuary Hall]]). When held in the House chamber, the Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. According to the [[U.S. Library of Congress]] exhibit ''Religion and the Founding of the American Republic'':

{{Quote|It is no exaggeration to say that on Sundays in Washington during the administrations of [[Thomas Jefferson]] (1801–1809) and of [[James Madison]] (1809–1817) the state became the church. Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the chamber of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Madison followed Jefferson's example, although unlike Jefferson, who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol, Madison came in a coach and four. Worship services in the House—a practice that continued until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]—were acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary. Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared. (Catholic priests began officiating in 1826.) As early as January 1806 a female evangelist, [[Dorothy Ripley]], delivered a camp meeting-style exhortation in the House to Jefferson, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Aaron Burr]], and a "crowded audience".<ref name= LOC-religion>{{cite web | title=Religion and the Founding of the American Republic | date=July 23, 2010 | publisher=U.S. Library of Congress| url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel06-2.html | accessdate=September 23, 2011}}</ref>}}

===War of 1812===
{{See also|Burning of Washington}}
[[File:US Capitol 1814c.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The Capitol after the August 1814 [[Burning of Washington|burning of Washington, D.C.]], by the British, during the [[War of 1812]] (painting 1814 by [[George Munger (artist)|George Munger]])]]

Not long after the completion of both wings, the Capitol was [[Burning of Washington|partially burned]] by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] on August 24, 1814, during the [[War of 1812]]. [[George Bomford]] and [[Joseph Gardner Swift]], both military engineers, were called upon to help rebuild the Capitol. Reconstruction began in 1815 and included redesigned chambers for both Senate and House wings (now sides), which were completed by 1819. During the reconstruction, Congress met in the [[Old Brick Capitol]], a temporary structure financed by local investors. Construction continued through to 1826, with the addition of the center section with front steps and columned portico and an interior [[United States Capitol rotunda|Rotunda]], rising above the first low dome of the Capitol. Latrobe is principally connected with the original construction and many innovative interior features; his successor, Bulfinch, also played a major role, such as the design of the first low dome covered in copper.

===The House and Senate Wings===
[[File:Capitol1846.jpg|thumb|left|[[Daguerreotype]] of east side of the Capitol in 1846, by [[John Plumbe]]]]

By 1850, it became clear that the Capitol could not accommodate the growing number of legislators arriving from newly admitted states. A new design competition was held, and President [[Millard Fillmore]] appointed Philadelphia architect [[Thomas U. Walter]] to carry out the expansion. Two new wings were added – a new chamber for the House of Representatives on the south side, and a new chamber for the Senate on the north.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmo-A_8HoOM | title=The History of the United States Capitol | publisher=YouTube | accessdate=February 19, 2012}}</ref>

When the Capitol was expanded in the 1850s, some of the construction labor was carried out by [[History of slavery in the United States|slaves]] "who cut the logs, laid the stones and baked the bricks".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://washingtontimes.com/national/20050531-110046-7574r.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050604031125/http://washingtontimes.com/national/20050531-110046-7574r.htm | archivedate=June 4, 2005 | title=Capitol slave labor studied | date=June 1, 2005 | agency=Associated Press | work=The Washington Times}}</ref> The original plan was to use workers brought in from Europe; however, there was a poor response to recruitment efforts, and African Americans, some free and some enslaved, composed the majority of the work force.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/05/subs/05_c.html | title=Timeline | publisher=White House Historical Association | accessdate=June 10, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519051655/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/05/subs/05_c.html | archive-date=May 19, 2007 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Capitol dome===
{{Main|United States Capitol dome}}
[[File:LincolnInauguration1861a.jpg|thumb|Inauguration of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1861, before the partially complete Capitol dome]]

The 1850 expansion more than doubled the length of the Capitol, and dwarfed the original, timber-framed, copper-sheeted, low dome of 1818, designed by [[Charles Bulfinch]] which was no longer in proportion with the increased size of the building. In 1855, the decision was made to tear it down and replace it with the "[[wedding-cake style]]" cast-iron dome that stands today. Also designed by [[Thomas U. Walter]], the new dome would stand three times the height of the original dome and {{convert|100|ft}} in diameter, yet had to be supported on the existing masonry piers. Like [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart|Mansart]]'s dome at "[[Les Invalides]]" (which he had visited in 1838), Walter's dome is double, with a large [[oculus]] in the inner dome, through which is seen ''"[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]"'' painted on a shell suspended from the supporting ribs, which also support the visible exterior structure and the [[wikt:tholos|tholos]] that supports The "[[Statue of Freedom]]", a colossal statue that was raised to the top of the dome in 1863. The weight of the [[cast iron]] for the dome has been published as {{convert|8909200|lb|kg}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Capitol Dome|url=https://www.aoc.gov/capitol-buildings/capitol-dome|publisher=Architect of the Capitol|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref>

===Later expansion===
[[File:Vault ag1982 0119x 085 1 opt.jpg|thumb|left|The Washington Depot with the U.S. Capitol in the distance (1872 view)]]

When the Capitol's new dome was finally completed, its massive visual weight, in turn, overpowered the proportions of the columns of the East [[Portico]], built in 1828. The East Front of the Capitol building was rebuilt in 1904, following a design of the architects [[Carrère and Hastings]], who also designed the [[Russell Senate Office Building|Russell Senate]] and [[Cannon House Office Building|Cannon House]] office buildings.

[[File:United States Capitol Building Interior 1860.png|thumb|right|Earliest known photograph of the interior of the United States Capitol building taken in 1860]]

The next major expansion to the Capitol started in 1958, with a {{convert|33.5|ft}} extension of the East Portico.{{citation needed| date=October 2012}} During this project, in 1960 the dome underwent a restoration.<ref name=Steinhauer/> A marble duplicate of the [[sandstone]] East Front was built {{convert|33.5|ft}} from the old Front. (In 1962, a connecting extension incorporated what had been an outside wall as an inside wall.) In the process, the original sandstone [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[column]]s were removed and replaced with marble. It was not until 1984 that landscape designer [[Russell Page]] created a suitable setting for them in a large meadow at the [[United States National Arboretum|U.S. National Arboretum]] in northeast Washington as the [[National Capitol Columns]], where they are combined with a reflecting pool in an ensemble that reminds some visitors of the ruins of [[Persepolis]], in [[Persia]]. Besides the columns, hundreds of blocks of the original stone were removed and are stored behind a [[National Park Service]] maintenance yard in [[Rock Creek Park]].<ref>Jule Banville, [http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/37113/stone-cold-whodunit "Stone-Cold Whodunit"] (April 24, 2009), ''Washington City Paper''</ref><ref>[http://www.rockcreekrunner.com/2011/07/25/stones-from-us-capitol-in-rock-creek-park/ "Stones from US Capitol in Rock Creek Park"] (July 25, 2011), ''Rock Creek Runner''</ref>

Prior to the center being built, visitors to the Capitol had to line up in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building or the Russell Senate Office Building. The new underground facility provides a grand entrance hall, a visitors theater, room for exhibits, and dining and restroom facilities, in addition to space for building necessities such as a [[utility tunnel|service tunnel]].

A large-scale Capitol dome restoration project, the first extensive such work since 1959–1960, began in 2014, with completion scheduled before the 2017 presidential inauguration.<ref name=AoC2014Restoration>{{cite web |title=Capitol Dome Restoration Project Overview |url=http://www.aoc.gov/dome/project-overview |website=[[Architect of the Capitol]] |accessdate=November 12, 2014}}</ref> As of 2012, $20&nbsp;million in work around the skirt of the dome had been completed, but other deterioration, including at least 1,300 cracks in the brittle iron that have led to rusting and seepage inside, needed to be addressed.

[[File:USA-US Capitol4.JPG|thumb|left|Capitol Rotunda (2013 view)]]

The Capitol building is marked by its central [[United States Capitol dome|dome]] above a [[United States Capitol rotunda|rotunda]] in the central section of the structure (which also includes the older original smaller center flanked by the two original (designed 1793, occupied 1800) smaller two wings (inner north) and inner south) containing the two original smaller [[debate chamber|meeting chambers]] for the Senate and the House of Representatives (between 1800 and late 1850s) and then flanked by two further extended (newer) wings, one also for each chamber of the larger, more populous Congress: the new north wing is the Senate chamber and the new south wing is the House of Representatives chamber. Above these newer chambers are galleries where visitors can watch the Senate and House of Representatives. It is an example of the [[neoclassical architecture]] style.

Tunnels and internal [[United States Capitol Subway System|subways]] connect the Capitol building with the [[Congressional office buildings]] in the [[United States Capitol Complex|Capitol Complex]]. All rooms in the Capitol are designated as either S (for Senate) or H (for House), depending on whether they are in the Senate or House wing of the Capitol.

[[File:Car of history.jpg|thumb|right|Carlo Franzoni's 1819 sculptural [[chariot clock]], the ''Car of History'', depicting [[Clio]], the Greek muse of history. National Statuary Hall (2006 view).]]

The Capitol has a long history in [[Visual arts of the United States|art of the United States]], beginning in 1856 with [[Italian American|Italian]]/[[Greek American]] artist [[Constantino Brumidi]] and his [[mural]]s in the hallways of the first floor of the Senate side of the Capitol. The murals, known as the [[Brumidi Corridors]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/brumidi/index.cfm | title=AOC.gov | publisher=AOC.gov | accessdate=November 5, 2010}}</ref> reflect great moments and people in [[History of the United States|United States history]]. Among the original works are those depicting [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[John Fitch (inventor)|John Fitch]], [[Robert Fulton]], and events such as the [[Louisiana Purchase|Cession of Louisiana]]. Also decorating the walls are animals, insects and natural [[Flora of the United States|flora]] indigenous to the United States. Brumidi's design left many spaces open so that future events in United States history could be added. Among those added are the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'', the [[Apollo 11|Moon landing]], and the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' crew]].

Brumidi also worked within the Rotunda. He is responsible for the painting of ''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'' beneath the top of the dome, and also the famous ''[[United States Capitol rotunda#Frieze of American History|Frieze of American History]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/rotunda/frieze/index.cfm | title=Frieze of American History | publisher=Aoc.gov | accessdate=November 5, 2010}}</ref> ''The Apotheosis of Washington'' was completed in 11 months and painted by Brumidi while suspended nearly {{convert|180|ft}} in the air. It is said to be the first attempt by the United States to deify a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding father]]. Washington is depicted surrounded by 13 [[Virginity|maidens]] in an inner ring with many [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman gods and goddesses]] below him in a second ring. The [[frieze]] is located around the inside of the base of the dome and is a chronological, pictorial history of the United States from the landing of [[Christopher Columbus]] to the [[Wright Brothers]]'s flight in [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]], [[North Carolina]]. The frieze was started in 1878 and was not completed until 1953. The frieze was therefore painted by four different artists: Brumidi, [[Filippo Costaggini]], [[Charles Ayer Whipple]], and [[Allyn Cox]]. The final scenes depicted in the fresco had not yet occurred when Brumidi began his ''Frieze of the United States History''.

[[File:USCapitolRotunda.JPG|thumb|left|[[United States Capitol rotunda|Capitol Rotunda]] (2005 view)]]

Within the Rotunda there are eight large paintings about the development of the United States as a nation. On the east side are four paintings depicting major events in the discovery of America. On the west are four paintings depicting the founding of the United States. The east side paintings include ''The Baptism of [[Pocahontas]]'' by [[John Gadsby Chapman]], ''The Embarkation of the [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]]'' by [[Robert Walter Weir]], ''The Discovery of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]'' by [[William Henry Powell]], and ''The Landing of Columbus'' by [[John Vanderlyn]]. The paintings on the west side are by [[John Trumbull]]: ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'', ''[[Surrender of General Burgoyne]]'', ''[[Surrender of Lord Cornwallis]]'', and ''[[General George Washington Resigning His Commission]]''. Trumbull was a contemporary of the United States' founding fathers and a participant in the [[American Revolutionary War]]; he painted a self-portrait into ''Surrender of Lord Cornwallis''.

[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'' (1819), by [[John Trumbull]]]]

''[[First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln]]'', an 1864 painting by [[Francis Bicknell Carpenter]], hangs over the west staircase in the Senate wing.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/artifact/Painting_33_00005.htm | title=U.S. Senate: Art & History Home, First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of Presid | publisher=Senate.gov | accessdate=February 19, 2012}}</ref>

[[File:National Statuary Hall Collection.jpg|thumb|right|[[National Statuary Hall Collection]] viewed from the south]]

The Capitol also houses the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]], comprising two statues donated by each of the [[U.S. state|fifty states]] to honor persons notable in their histories. One of the most notable statues in the [[National Statuary Hall]] is a [[Kamehameha Statue|bronze statue of King Kamehameha]] donated by the state of Hawaii upon its accession to the union in 1959. The statue's extraordinary weight of {{convert|15,000|lb|kg}} raised concerns that it might come crashing through the floor, so it was moved to Emancipation Hall of the new Capitol Visitor Center. The 100th, and last statue for the collection, that of [[Popé|Po'pay]] from the state of [[New Mexico]], was added on September 22, 2005. It was the first statue moved into the Emancipation Hall.

===Crypt===
[[File:USA-US Capitol2.JPG|thumb|left|Capitol Crypt]]

On the ground floor is an area known as [[United States Capitol crypt|the Crypt]]. It was intended to be the burial place of George Washington, with a ringed [[balustrade]] at the center of the Rotunda above looking down to his tomb. However, under the stipulations of his last [[Will (law)|will]], Washington was buried at [[Mount Vernon]]. The Crypt houses exhibits on the history of the Capitol. A [[Compass rose|compass star]] inlaid in the floor marks the point at which Washington, D.C. is divided into its four quadrants and is the basis for how [[Streets and highways of Washington, D.C.|addresses in Washington, D.C.]], are designated ([[Northeast, Washington, D.C.|NE]], [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|NW]], [[Southeast, Washington, D.C.|SE]], or [[Southwest, Washington, D.C.|SW]]).

Within the Crypt is [[Gutzon Borglum]]'s massive ''Abraham Lincoln Bust''. The sculptor had a fascination with large-scale art and themes of heroic nationalism, and carved the piece from a six-ton block of [[marble]]. Borglum carved the bust in 1908, and it was donated to the Congress by [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer, Jr.]], and accepted by the [[Joint Committee on the Library]], in the same year. The pedestal was specially designed by the sculptor and installed in 1911. The bust and pedestal were on display in the Rotunda for many years until 1979 when, after a rearrangement of all sculpture in the Rotunda, they were placed in the Crypt.<ref name="Abraham Lincoln Bust">{{cite web|title=Abraham Lincoln Bust|url=https://www.aoc.gov/art/busts/abraham-lincoln-bust|publisher=Architect of the Capitol|accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref> Borglum was a patriot; believing that the "monuments we have built are not our own", he looked to create art that was "American, drawn from American sources, memorializing American achievement", according to a 1908 interview article.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Borglum's depiction of Lincoln was so accurate, that [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], the president's son, praised the bust as "the most extraordinarily good portrait of my father I have ever seen".<ref name="Abraham Lincoln Bust"/> Supposedly, according to legend, the marble head remains unfinished (missing the left ear) to symbolize Lincoln's [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|unfinished life]].

===Features===
At one end of the room near the [[Old Supreme Court Chamber]] is a statue of [[John C. Calhoun]]. On the right leg of the statue, a mark from a bullet fired during the [[United States Capitol shooting incident (1998)|1998 shooting incident]] is clearly visible. The bullet also left a mark on the cape, located on the back right side of the statue.

Twelve presidents have [[Lying in state|lain in state]] in the Rotunda for public viewing, most recently [[George H. W. Bush]]. The tomb meant for Washington stored the [[catafalque]] which is used to support [[coffin]]s lying in state or honor in the Capitol. The catafalque now on display in the Exhibition Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center was used for President Lincoln.

The [[Hall of Columns]] is located on the House side of the Capitol, home to twenty-eight fluted columns and statues from the National Statuary Hall Collection. In the basement of the Capitol building in a utility room are two marble bathtubs, which are all that remain of the once elaborate Senate baths. These baths were a [[spa]]-like facility designed for members of Congress and their guests before many buildings in the city had modern plumbing. The facilities included several bathtubs, a barbershop, and a [[massage parlor]].

A steep, metal staircase, totaling 365 steps, leads from the basement to an outdoor walkway on top of the Capitol's dome.<ref name=365steps>{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/10/us/365-steps-to-the-top-of-capitol-hill.html | title= 365 Steps to the Top of Capitol Hill | date= August 10, 1997 | work=The New York Times | at= Section 1, Page 22 | accessdate=August 9, 2009 }}</ref> The number of steps represents each day of the year.<ref name=thirtyyears>{{cite book | last= Logan | first= Mrs. John A.

===Height===
{{for|more details|Heights of Buildings Act of 1910|The Height of Buildings Act of 1899|List of tallest buildings in Washington, D.C.}}

Contrary to a popular myth, [[The Height of Buildings Act of 1899|D.C. building height laws]] have never referred to the height of the Capitol building, which rises to {{convert|289|ft|m|0}}.<ref>{{cite web| author=Matthew Gilmore | url=http://www.h-net.org/~dclist/building_height | title=H-DC Discussion Network | publisher=H-net.org | accessdate=November 5, 2010}}</ref> Indeed, the Capitol is only the [[List of tallest buildings in Washington, D.C.|fifth-tallest structure in Washington]].

===House Chamber===<!-- This section is linked from [[Hammurabi]] -->
The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] Chamber has 448 permanent seats. Unlike senators, representatives do not have assigned seats.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/art_artifacts/virtual_tours/house_chamber/index.html | title=The House Chamber}}</ref> The chamber is large enough to accommodate members of all three branches of the federal government and invited guests for [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint sessions]] of Congress such as the [[State of the Union]] speech and other events. It is adorned with [[Relief|relief portraits]] of famous lawmakers and lawgivers throughout history. The [[United States national motto]] "[[In God We Trust]]" is written over the tribune below the clock and above the United States flag. Of the twenty-three relief portraits only Moses is sculpted from a full front view and is located across from the dais where the Speaker of the House ceremonially sits.

===Old Chambers===
====Statuary Hall (Old Hall of the House)====

The National [[Statuary Hall]] is a chamber in the United States Capitol devoted to sculptures of prominent Americans. The hall, also known as the Old Hall of the House, is a large, two-story, semicircular room with a second story gallery along the curved perimeter. It is located immediately south of the Rotunda. The meeting place of the U.S. House of Representatives for nearly 50 years (1807–1857), after a few years of disuse in 1864 it was repurposed as a statuary hall.

====Old Senate Chamber====

The [[Old Senate Chamber]] is a room in the United States Capitol that was the legislative chamber of the United States Senate from 1810 to 1859, and served as the Supreme Court chamber from 1860 until 1935.

====Old Supreme Court Chamber====

This room was originally the lower half of the [[Old Senate Chamber]] from 1800 to 1806. After division of the chamber in two levels, this room was used from 1806 until 1860 as the Supreme Court Chamber. In 1860, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] began using the newly vacated Old Senate Chamber. In 1935, the Supreme Court vacated the Capitol Building and began meeting in the [[United States Supreme Court Building]] across the street.

===Grounds===
[[File:U.S. Capitol grounds magnolias in March 2020.jpg|thumb|[[Magnolia]]s bloom on the Capitol Grounds in March 2020]]{{See also|United States Capitol Complex}}
The [[United States Capitol Complex|Capitol Grounds]] cover approximately 274 acres (1.11&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), with the grounds proper consisting mostly of lawns, walkways, streets, drives, and planting areas. Several monumental sculptures used to be located on the east facade and lawn of the Capitol including ''[[The Rescue (statue)|The Rescue]]'' and ''[[George Washington (Greenough)|George Washington]]''. The current grounds were designed by noted American [[landscape architect]] [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who planned the expansion and landscaping performed from 1874 to 1892. In 1875, as one of his first recommendations, Olmsted proposed the construction of the [[marble]] [[Terrace garden|terraces]] on the north, west, and south sides of the building that exist today.

Olmsted also designed the Summerhouse, the open-air brick building that sits just north of the Capitol. Three [[arch]]es open into the [[hexagon]]al structure, which encloses a fountain and twenty-two brick chairs. A fourth wall holds a small window that looks onto an artificial [[grotto]]. Built between 1879 and 1881, the Summerhouse was intended to answer complaints that visitors to the Capitol had no place to sit and no place to obtain water for their horses and themselves. Modern [[drinking fountain]]s have since replaced Olmsted's fountain for the latter purpose. Olmsted intended to build a second, matching Summerhouse on the southern side of the Capitol, but congressional objections led to the project's cancellation.<ref>{{cite web

===Flags===
Up to four [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flags]] can be seen flying over the Capitol. Two flagpoles are located at the base of the dome on the East and West sides. These flagpoles have flown the flag day and night since [[World War I]]. The other two flagpoles are above the North (Senate) and South (House of Representatives) wings of the building, and fly only when the chamber below is in session. The flag above the House of Representatives is raised and lowered by [[United States House of Representatives Page|House pages]]. The flag above the United States Senate is raised and lowered by Senate Doorkeepers. To raise the flag, Doorkeepers access the roof of the Capitol from the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States Senate|Senate Sergeant at Arms]]'s office. Several auxiliary flagpoles, to the west of the dome and not visible from the ground, are used to meet congressional requests for flags flown over the Capitol.{{Citation needed | date=September 2010 | reason=these auxiliary flagpoles do not seem to appear in aerial photos...}} [[Electoral district|Constituents]] pay for U.S. flags flown over the Capitol to commemorate a variety of events such as the death of a [[veteran]] family member.

The Capitol, as well as the grounds of [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]], have played host to major events, including [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential inaugurations]] held every four years. During an inauguration, the front of the Capitol is outfitted with a platform and a grand staircase. Annual events at the Capitol include [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebrations, and the [[National Memorial Day Concert]].

The general public has paid respect to a number of individuals [[lying in state]] at the Capitol, including numerous former presidents, senators, and other officials. Other Americans lying in honor include [[United States Capitol Police|Officers]] [[Jacob Chestnut]] and [[John Gibson (police officer)|John Gibson]], the two officers killed in the [[1998 United States Capitol shooting incident|1998 shooting incident]]. Chestnut was the first African American ever to lie in honor in the Capitol. The public also paid respect to [[Rosa Parks]], an icon of the [[civil rights movement]], at the Capitol in 2005. She was the first woman and second African American to lie in honor in the Capitol. In February 2018, the evangelical Rev. [[Billy Graham]] became the fourth private citizen to lie in honor in the Rotunda.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=March 8, 2018|title=Billy Graham Will Be the Fourth Private Citizen Ever to Lie in Honor at the U.S. Capitol|url=http://time.com/5172998/billy-graham-capitol-rotunda/|website=Time}}</ref>

On January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol. When President [[Andrew Jackson]] was leaving the Capitol out of the East Portico after the funeral of [[South Carolina]] Representative [[Warren R. Davis]], [[Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)|Richard Lawrence]], an unemployed and deranged housepainter from England, either burst from a crowd or stepped out from hiding behind a column and aimed a pistol at Jackson which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol which also misfired. It has since been postulated that the moisture from the humid weather of the day contributed to the double misfiring.<ref name="AmericanHeritage.com">{{cite web | title=Trying to Assassinate Andrew Jackson | author=Jon Grinspan | url=http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20070130-richard-lawrence-andrew-jackson-assassination-warren-r-davis.shtml | accessdate=November 11, 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024234731/http://www.americanheritage.com/people/articles/web/20070130-richard-lawrence-andrew-jackson-assassination-warren-r-davis.shtml | archivedate=October 24, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Lawrence was then restrained, with legend saying that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane, prompting his aides to restrain him. Others present, including [[Davy Crockett]], restrained and disarmed Lawrence.

On July 2, 1915, prior to the United States' entry into [[World War I]], [[Eric Muenter]] (aka Frank Holt), a German professor who wanted to stop American support of the [[Allies of World War I]], exploded a bomb in the reception room of the U.S. Senate. The next morning he tried to assassinate [[J. P. Morgan, Jr.]], son of [[J. P. Morgan|the financier]], at his home on [[Long Island]], New York. In a letter to the ''[[Washington Star|Washington Evening Star]]'' published after the explosion, Muenter, writing under an assumed name, said he hoped that the detonation would "make enough noise to be heard above the voices that clamor for war." [[J.P. Morgan & Co.|J.P. Morgan's company]] served as Great Britain's principal U.S. purchasing agent for [[Ammunition|munitions]] and other war supplies.

In 1954, [[United States Capitol shooting incident (1954)|Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire]] on members of Congress from the visitors' gallery, injuring five representatives. On March 1, 1971, a bomb exploded on the ground floor of the Capitol, placed by the [[Far left|radical left]] [[Domestic terrorism in the United States|domestic terrorist]] group, the [[Weather Underground Organization|Weather Underground]]. They [[List of Weatherman actions|placed the bomb]] as a demonstration against U.S. involvement in [[Laos]]. On November 7, 1983, a group called the [[Armed Resistance Unit]] claimed responsibility for a [[1983 United States Senate bombing|bomb]] that detonated in the lobby outside the office of [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Minority Leader]] [[Robert Byrd]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Capitol Bombing: Group Hit Other Targets, FBI Believes | author=Kessler, Ronald | work=The Washington Post | date=November 9, 1983}}</ref> Six people associated with the [[John Brown Anti-Klan Committee]] were later found in [[contempt of court]] for refusing to testify about the bombing.<ref>{{cite news | title=Judge Finds Four in Contempt in Bombing Probe | author=Seppy, Tom | agency=Associated Press | date=February 12, 1985}}</ref> In 1990, three members of the Armed Resistance Unit were convicted of the bombing, which they claimed was in response to the [[invasion of Grenada]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Three Leftists Plead Guilty to Bombing the U.S. Capitol | author=Rowley, James | agency=Associated Press | date=September 7, 1990}}</ref> On July 24, 1998, Russell Eugene Weston Jr. [[United States Capitol shooting incident (1998)|burst into the Capitol]] and opened fire, killing two [[United States Capitol Police|Capitol Police]] officers, Officer Jacob Chestnut and Det.

The Capitol is believed to have been the intended target of the hijacked [[United Airlines Flight 93]] on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], before it crashed near [[Shanksville]] in [[Somerset County, Pennsylvania]], after passengers tried to take over control of the plane from hijackers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/09/12/alqaeda.911.claim/index.html |title=Al-Jazeera offers accounts of 9/11 planning |accessdate=June 3, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220124318/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/09/12/alqaeda.911.claim/index.html |archivedate=February 20, 2006  }}</ref><ref>[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/sec1.pdf Report of the 9/11 Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206003448/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/sec1.pdf |date=December 6, 2006 }}, US Govt Printing Office</ref>

Since the September 11 attacks, the roads and grounds around the Capitol have undergone dramatic changes. The United States Capitol Police have also installed checkpoints to inspect vehicles at specific locations around Capitol Hill,<ref>{{cite press release | title= Increased Security on Capitol Grounds | publisher= United States Capitol Police | date= August 2, 2004 | url= http://www.uscapitolpolice.gov/pressreleases/2004/pr_08-02-04.html | accessdate= September 26, 2006 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061101074343/http://www.uscapitolpolice.gov/pressreleases/2004/pr_08-02-04.html | archivedate= November 1, 2006 | df= mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="street closing">{{cite news | author=Lyndsey Layton and Manny Fernandez | title= Street Closing Irks D.C.

On the main east–west thoroughfares of [[Constitution Avenue|Constitution]] and [[Independence Avenue (Washington D.C.)|Independence Avenue]]s, [[barricade]]s are implanted in the roads that can be raised in the event of an emergency. Trucks larger than [[Pickup truck|pickups]] are interdicted by the Capitol Police and are instructed to use other routes. On the checkpoints at the shorter cross streets, the barriers are typically kept in a permanent "emergency" position, and only vehicles with special permits are allowed to pass. All Capitol visitors are screened by a [[magnetometer]], and all items that visitors may bring inside the building are screened by an [[X-ray generator|x-ray device]]. In both chambers, gas masks are located underneath the chairs in each chamber for members to use in case of emergency.{{Citation needed | date=July 2010}} Structures ranging from scores of [[Jersey barrier]]s to hundreds of ornamental [[bollard]]s have been erected to obstruct the path of any vehicles that might stray from the designated roadways.<ref>{{cite news | author=Post Store | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/28/AR2006012801056.html | title=WashingtonPost.com | work=The Washington Post | date= January 29, 2006 | accessdate=November 5, 2010}}</ref>

In 2004, the capitol was briefly evacuated after a plane carrying the then governor of Kentucky strayed into restricted airspace over the district.
A shooting incident occurred in March 2016. One female bystander was wounded by police but not seriously injured; a man pointing a gun was shot and arrested, in critical but stable condition.<ref name=NYTMar16>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/us/politics/us-capitol-lockdown.html|title=U.S. Capitol on Lockdown After Reports of Gunshots|author=Michael S.
