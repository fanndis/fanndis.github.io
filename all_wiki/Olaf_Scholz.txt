He served as [[List of mayors of Hamburg|First Mayor of Hamburg]] from 7 March 2011 to 13 March 2018 and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Acting Leader of the Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) from 13 February to 22 April 2018.

A member of the [[Bundestag]] from 1998 to 2001 and again from 2002 to 2011, Scholz was Minister of the Interior of Hamburg under First Mayor [[Ortwin Runde]] from May to October 2001 and general secretary of his party under chairman and chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] from 2002 to 2004. He served as [[Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs|Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs]] in Merkel's first [[Grand Coalition]] from 2007 to 2009 and leader of the SPD in [[Hamburg]] from 2000 to 2004 and again from 2009 to 2018.

Together with former [[Brandenburg]] state representative [[Klara Geywitz]], he received most votes in the first round of the 2019 election for the newly introduced dual leadership of his party,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-spd-result/germanys-scholz-tops-spd-leader-vote-but-faces-run-off-idUSKBN1X50EL |title=Germany's Scholz tops SPD leader vote, but faces run-off |author=Madeline Chambers |date=2019-10-26 |access-date=2020-02-07}}</ref> but lost with 45% in the ensuing run-off to the winners [[Norbert Walter-Borjans]] and [[Saskia Esken]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-social-democrats-throw-coalition-with-merkel-into-doubt/a-51484038 |title=Germany's Social Democrats throw coalition with Merkel into doubt |date=2019-11-30 |editor=[[Deutsche Welle]] |access-date=2020-02-08}}</ref>

On August 10, 2020, the SPD party executive nominated him as its chancellor candidate for the [[2021 German federal election|2021 federal election in Germany]].

==Early life and education==
Born in the northwestern city of [[Osnabrück]], Scholz grew up in Hamburg's [[Rahlstedt]] district and studied at the [[University of Hamburg]] to become a lawyer specializing in labour law.<ref name="auto">Guy Chazan (9 February 2018), [https://www.ft.com/content/170b9d0a-0cc2-11e8-8eb7-42f857ea9f09  Olaf Scholz, a sound guardian for Germany’s finances] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

==Political career==
A former vice president of the [[International Union of Socialist Youth]], Scholz represented [[Hamburg Altona (electoral district)|Hamburg Altona]] in the Bundestag between 1998 and 2001 as well as between 2002 and 2011. From May to October 2001, he was Minister of the Interior ''(Innensenator)'' of [[Hamburg]] under First Mayor [[Ortwin Runde]] and from 2002 to 2004 he was [[Secretary-General]] of the SPD; he resigned from that office when Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]], facing disaffection within his own party and hampered by persistently low public approval ratings, announced that he would step down as chairman of the Social Democratic Party.<ref>Richard Bernstein (7 February 2004), [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/07/world/schroder-quitting-party-post-citing-need-to-pursue-reforms.html] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

Scholz served as the SPD parliamentary group's spokesperson on the inquiry committee investigating the [[German Visa Affair 2005|German Visa Affair]] in 2005. Following the [[2005 German federal election|federal elections]] later that year, he served as First Parliamentary Secretary of the SPD parliamentary group. In this capacity, he worked closely with the CDU parliamentary floor manager [[Norbert Röttgen]] to manage and defend the [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] led by [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] in parliament.<ref>Sebastian Fischer (13 November 2007), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/muentefering-resignation-merkel-loses-mr-grand-coalition-a-517132.html Müntefering Resignation: Merkel Loses 'Mr. Grand Coalition'] ''[[Spiegel Online]]''.</ref> He also served as member of the [[Parliamentary Oversight Panel (Germany)|Parliamentary Oversight Panel (PKGr)]], which provides parliamentary oversight of Germany's intelligence services [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|BND]], [[Militärischer Abschirmdienst|MAD]] and [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution|BfV]]. In addition, he was a member of the parliamentary body in charge of appointing judges to the Highest Courts of Justice, namely the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]] (BGH), the [[Federal Administrative Court of Germany|Federal Administrative Court]] (BVerwG), the [[Federal Finance Court of Germany|Federal Fiscal Court]] (BFH), the [[Federal Labour Court of Germany|Federal Labour Court]] (BAG), and the [[Federal Social Court of Germany|Federal Social Court]] (BSG).

Scholz succeeded [[Franz Müntefering]] as [[Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (Germany)|Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs]] in the [[First Merkel cabinet|first cabinet of Chancellor Angela Merkel]], when Müntefering left office in November 2007.<ref>Andreas Cremer and Brian Parkin, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=avKnSh84M5yQ&refer=europe "Muentefering, Vice-Chancellor Under Merkel, Quits"], Bloomberg.com, 13 November 2007.</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080217055653/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/21/europe/EU-POL-Germany-Merkels-Two-Years.php "Merkel defends record as Germany's tense governing coalition hits 2-year mark"], Associated Press, 21 November 2007.</ref>

On 20 February 2011 the Social Democrats led by Scholz won the [[2011 Hamburg state election]] with 48.3% of the votes, resulting in 62 out of 121 seats in the [[Hamburg Parliament]].<ref>[http://www.aicgs.org/analysis/special/elections11/hamburg.aspx AICGS Coverage of the 2011 Land Elections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316180205/http://www.aicgs.org/analysis/special/elections11/hamburg.aspx |date=16 March 2011 }}</ref> Scholz resigned as a member of the [[List of members of the 17th Bundestag|seventeenth]] [[Bundestag]] on 11 March 2011 shortly after his election as First Mayor; [[Dorothee Stapelfeldt]], also a Social Democrat, was made Deputy First Mayor.

In his capacity as mayor, Scholz represented Hamburg and Germany internationally. On 7 June 2011, Scholz attended the [[state dinner]] hosted by President [[Barack Obama]] in honor of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] at the [[White House]].<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/06/07/expected-attendees-tonights-state-dinner Expected Attendees at Tonight's State Dinner] [[Office of the First Lady of the United States]], press release of 7 June 2011.</ref> As host of Hamburg's annual St. Matthias' Day banquet for the city's civic and business leaders, he has invited several high-ranking guests of honour to the city, including [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Jean-Marc Ayrault]] of [[France]] (2013), [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] of the [[United Kingdom]] (2016), and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Justin Trudeau]] of [[Canada]] (2017).<ref>Josh Wingrove (17 February 2017), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-17/trudeau-stresses-fair-wages-tax-compliance-in-warning-to-europe Trudeau Stresses Fair Wages, Tax Compliance in Warning to Europe] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> From 2015 until 2018, he also served as [[France–Germany relations|Commissioner of the Federal Republic of Germany for Cultural Affairs under the Treaty on Franco-German Cooperation]].<ref>[https://www.welt.de/regionales/hamburg/article136617287/Scholz-Bevollmaechtigter-fuer-deutsch-franzoesische-Kulturzusammenarbeit.html Scholz Bevollmächtigter für deutsch-französische Kulturzusammenarbeit] ''[[Die Welt]]'', 21 January 2015.</ref>

In 2013, Scholz opposed a public initiative aiming at a complete buyback of energy grids Hamburg had sold to utilities [[Vattenfall|Vattenfall Europe AG]] and [[E.ON]] decades before; he argued this would overburden the city, whose debt pile stood at more than 20 billion euros at the time.<ref>Nicholas Brautlecht (23 September 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-23/hamburg-backs-eu2-billion-buyback-of-power-grids-in-plebiscite Hamburg Backs EU2 Billion Buyback of Power Grids in Plebiscite] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref>

Scholz participated in the exploratory talks between the CDU, CSU and SPD parties to form a coalition government following the [[2013 German federal election|2013 federal elections]].<ref>Arne Delfs and Patrick Donahue (30 September 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-29/germany-readies-for-weeks-of-coalition-talks-as-parties-position Germany Sets Coalition Talks Date as Weeks of Bartering Loom] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> In the subsequent negotiations, he led the SPD delegation in the financial policy working group; his co-chair from the CDU/CSU was Finance Minister [[Wolfgang Schäuble]].<ref>Patrick Donahue (28 October 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-27/merkel-enters-concrete-spd-talks-as-finance-post-looms Merkel Enters Concrete SPD Talks as Finance Post Looms] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref> Alongside fellow Social Democrats [[Jörg Asmussen]] and [[Thomas Oppermann]], Scholz was considered a possible successor to Schäuble in the post of finance minister at the time.<ref>Rainer Buergin and Birgit Jennen (20 September 2013), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-09-19/schaeuble-seen-keeping-finance-post-even-in-spd-coalition Schaeuble Seen Keeping Finance Post Even in SPD Coalition] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref>

In a paper compiled in late 2014, Scholz and Schäuble proposed redirecting revenue from the so-called [[Taxation in Germany|solidarity surcharge]] on income and corporate tax (''Solidaritätszuschlag'') to subsidize the federal states’ interest payments.<ref>Rainer Buergin (4 March 2015), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-04/merkel-weighs-end-of-reunification-tax-for-east-germany Merkel Weighs End of Reunification Tax for East Germany] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.</ref>

Under Scholz’ leadership, the Social Democrats handily won the [[2015 Hamburg state election|2015 state elections]] in Hamburg, receiving around 47 percent of the vote.<ref>Caroline Copley (15 February 2015), [https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2015/02/15/world/europe/15reuters-germany-politics-hamburg.html Merkel's Conservatives Suffer Blow in State Vote, Eurosceptics Gain] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> His [[coalition government]] with the [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green Party]] – with Green leader [[Katharina Fegebank]] serving as Deputy First Mayor – was sworn in on 15 April 2015.

In 2015, Scholz led Hamburg's bid to host the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] at an estimated budget of 11.2 billion euros ($12.6 billion), competing against [[Los Angeles]], [[Paris]], [[Rome]] and [[Budapest]];<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/08/hamburg-mayor-olympics-2024-london Hamburg mayor: our Olympics will cost $12.6bn, less than London 2012] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 8 October 2015.</ref> the citizens of Hamburg, however, later rejected the candidacy in a referendum, with more than half voting against the project.<ref>Karolos Grohmann (29 November 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/29/us-olympics-hamburg-idUSKBN0TI0VC20151129#w6XLgBAPrJ4COKFY.97 Hamburg drops 2024 Games bid after referendum defeat] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In 2015, Scholz – alongside [[Minister-President]] [[Torsten Albig]] of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] – negotiated a [[Debt restructuring|restructuring deal]] with the [[European Commission]] that allowed the German regional lender [[HSH Nordbank]] to offload 6.2 billion euros in troubled assets – mainly non-performing ship loans – onto its government majority owners and avoid being shut down, saving around 2,500 jobs.<ref>Arno Schuetze and Foo Yun Chee (27 May 2015), [http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/10/19/eu-hsh-nordbank-restructuring-idINL8N12J2SX20151019 HSH Nordbank strikes rescue deal with EU] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

===Federal Minister of Finance, 2018–present===
On 14 March 2018, Olaf Scholz became [[Federal Ministry of Finance (Germany)|Federal Minister of Finance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/hamburg/index.html|title=Nachrichten aus Hamburg|last=NDR|website=www.ndr.de}}</ref>

Within the first months in office, Scholz became one of Germany's most popular politicians with an approval rating of close to 50 percent.<ref name="auto1">Michael Nienaber (29 May 2018), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-scholz-analysis/germanys-miserly-scholz-irks-comrades-at-home-and-abroad-idUSKCN1IU0EX Germany's 'miserly' Scholz irks comrades at home and abroad] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

==Political positions==
Within his party, Scholz is widely regarded as part of the [[Conservatism|conservative]] wing.<ref name="auto"/>

After the [[2017 German federal election|2017 national elections]], Scholz was publicly critical of party leader [[Martin Schulz]]’s strategy and messaging, releasing a paper titled “No excuses! Answer new questions for the future! Clear principles!” With his proposals for reforming the party, he was widely interpreted to position himself as a potential challenger (or successor) to Schulz within the SPD. In the weeks after his party first started weighing a return to government, Scholz urged compromise and was one of the SPD members more inclined toward another [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]].<ref>Emily Schultheis (5 January 2018), [https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-coalition-the-key-players-in-germany-exploratory-coalition-talks/ 8 key players in Germany’s coalition talks] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref>

Since taking office as minister of finance, Scholz has been committed to a continued goal of no new debt and limited public spending.<ref name="auto1"/> In 2018, he suggested the creation of a Europe-wide unemployment insurance system to make the [[eurozone]] more resilient to future economic shocks. He also wants to introduce a [[financial transaction tax]].<ref>Myriam Rivet and Michael Nienaber (10 June 2018), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-germany-meeting/france-germany-still-split-on-eurozone-reforms-french-official-says-idUSKBN1J60FM France, Germany still split on eurozone reforms, French official says] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

==Controversy==
When ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'' interviewed Scholz, then serving as secretary general of the ruling SPD, during a 2003 party conference, he later demanded massive changes and threatened to pull the entire piece. When the editors said they would go ahead and publish it without authorization, Scholz warned that the paper would be excluded from all future SPD background talks.<ref>Moritz Schuller (7 September 2003), [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/dec/08/mondaymediasection7 The right to revise] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref> The newspaper published the interview with all of Scholz's answers blacked, and the paper's editor-in-chief [[Bascha Mika]] condemned his behavior as a "betrayal of the claim to a free press, a betrayal of the journalist's self-definition, a betrayal of the reader."<ref>Ben Knight (19 January 2016), [http://www.dw.com/en/time-to-end-interview-authorization-in-germany/a-18989875 Time to end interview authorization in Germany?] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''</ref>

Scholz was criticized for his handling of the riots that took place during [[2017 G20 Hamburg summit|2017 G20 summit]] in Hamburg. Mayor Scholz apologized to residents, but refused to resign.<ref name="auto"/>

==Personal life==
Olaf Scholz is married to Britta Ernst (born 1961); they have no children. She is also a politician (SPD).

The couple lived in Hamburg's [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] district before moving to [[Potsdam]] in 2018.<ref>Ildiko Röd (25 June 2018), [http://www.maz-online.de/Lokales/Potsdam/Vizekanzler-Olaf-Scholz-wohnt-jetzt-in-Potsdam Vizekanzler ist Neu-Potsdamer] ''[[Märkische Allgemeine]]''.</ref>
