Amanpour is the Chief International Anchor for [[CNN]] and host of [[CNN International|CNN International's]] nightly interview program ''[[Amanpour]]''. She is also the host of ''[[Amanpour & Company]]'' on [[PBS]].

==Early life and education==
Amanpour was born in the west London suburb of [[Ealing]], the daughter of Mohammad Taghi and Patricia Anne Amanpour (''née'' Hill).<ref name=fdr1/><ref>{{cite news |title=Christiane Amanpour's Biography |url=https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/christiane-amanpour/biography-anchor-week-christiane-amanpour/story?id=11208824 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref> Her father was Persian, from [[Tehran]]. Amanpour was raised in Tehran until age eleven.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=xvrQRj8yR8Qjl9d5UIZHzw&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=7 March 2020|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{YouTube|kLzKXhbumL8|ABC News video: "Back to the Beginning: Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity"}} retrieved 10 August 2013 | Minute 6:06 | ''"My mother is a Christian from England and my father a Muslim from Iran. I married a Jewish American."''</ref> Her father was Muslim and her mother was Catholic.<ref name=fdr1/> She is natively fluent in English and [[Persian language|Persian]].<ref name="auto"/> 

After completing the larger part of her primary school education in Iran, she was sent by her parents to boarding school in England when she was 11. She attended Holy Cross Convent, an all-girls school located in [[Chalfont St Peter]], Buckinghamshire, and then, at age 16, [[New Hall School]], a Roman Catholic school in [[Chelmsford]], Essex. Christiane and her family returned to England not long after the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] began. She has stressed that they were not forced to leave the country, but were actually returning to England due to the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. The family ultimately remained in England, finding it difficult to return to Iran.<ref>[http://www.wowowow.com/pov/lesley-stahl-interview-christiane-amanpour-height-iranian-election-aftermath-322988?page=0%2C2 The Lesley Stahl Interview: Christiane Amanpour, at the Height of the Iranian Election Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625021437/http://www.wowowow.com/pov/lesley-stahl-interview-christiane-amanpour-height-iranian-election-aftermath-322988?page=0%2C2 |date=25 June 2010 }}</ref>

After leaving New Hall, Amanpour moved to the United States to study journalism at the [[University of Rhode Island]]. During her time there, she worked in the news department at [[WBRU|WBRU-FM]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. She also worked for [[NBC]] affiliate [[WJAR]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], Rhode Island, as an electronic graphics designer.<ref>{{cite web|title=CPJ Board of Directors|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|url=http://www.cpj.org/development/board.html#ca}}</ref> In 1983, Amanpour graduated from the university ''[[summa cum laude]]'' and [[Phi Beta Kappa]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/09/style/weddings-jamie-rubin-christiane-amanpour.html|title=WEDDINGS; Jamie Rubin, Christiane Amanpour|publisher=}}</ref> with a B.A. degree in journalism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://usliberals.about.com/od/thepressandjournalist1/p/Amanpour.htm |title=Profile of Christiane Amanpour, CNN Chief International Correspondent |accessdate=24 August 2007 |author=Deborah White}}</ref>

==CNN==
In 1983, she was hired by CNN on the foreign desk in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], as an entry-level desk assistant. During her early years as a correspondent, Amanpour was given her first major assignment covering the [[Iran–Iraq War]], which led to her being transferred in 1986 to Eastern Europe to report on the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of European communism]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Christiane Amanpour, CNN International Chief Correspondent|publisher=about.com|url=http://usliberals.about.com/od/thepressandjournalist1/p/Amanpour.htm}}</ref> In 1989, she was assigned to work in [[Frankfurt]] am Main, [[West Germany]], where she reported on the democratic revolutions sweeping Eastern Europe at the time. Through this position, she was able to move up in the company and by 1990 served as a correspondent for CNN's New York bureau.

Following [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraq's occupation of Kuwait]] in 1990, Amanpour's reports of the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] brought her wide notice while also taking CNN to a new level of news coverage. Thereafter, she reported from the [[Bosnian war]] and other conflict zones. Because of her emotional delivery from [[Sarajevo]] during the [[Siege of Sarajevo]], viewers and critics questioned her professional objectivity, claiming that many of her reports were unjustified and favoured the Bosnian Muslims, to which she replied, "There are some situations one simply cannot be neutral about, because when you are neutral you are an accomplice. Objectivity doesn't mean treating all sides equally. It means giving each side a hearing."<ref>{{cite web|title=Five Years Later, the Gulf War Story Is Still Being Told|work=New York Times|date=12 May 1996| url =http://writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/Coursetexts/gulf-war-arnett.html}}</ref> Amanpour gained a reputation for being fearless during the Gulf and Bosnian wars and for reporting from conflict areas.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Wooing of Amanpour|url=http://www.newsweek.com/1996/05/19/the-wooing-of-amanpour.html|accessdate=31 July 2010|newspaper=[[Newsweek]]|date=20 May 1996}}</ref>

From 1992 to 2010, Amanpour was CNN's chief international correspondent as well as the anchor of ''[[Amanpour]]'', a daily CNN interview program that aired 2009–2010. Amanpour has reported on major crises from many of the world's hotspots, including [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Pakistan]], [[Somalia]], [[Rwanda]], and the [[Balkans]] and from the United States during [[Hurricane Katrina]]. She has secured exclusive interviews with world leaders from the Middle East to Europe, Africa and beyond, including Iranian presidents [[Mohammad Khatami]] and [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], as well as the presidents of [[Afghanistan]], [[Sudan]], and [[Syria]], among others.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} After [[9/11]], she was the first international correspondent to interview British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], French President [[Jacques Chirac]], and Pakistani President [[Pervez Musharraf]]. Other interviewees have included [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Nicolás Maduro]], [[Hassan Rouhani]], [[Emmanuel Macron]], [[Angela Merkel]], [[John Kerry]], the [[Dalai Lama]] and [[Moammar Gadhafi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__1rqFMmdCY |title=U S Exclusive Moammar Gadhafi Tells Christiane Amanpour that Libya's People Love Him ABC News |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>

She has also conducted interviews with [[Constantine II of Greece]], [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Reza Pahlavi]], [[Ameera al-Taweel]] and actors [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Meryl Streep]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdxXKHOZvWw |title=Angelina Jolie on CNN with Christiane Amanpour Pt2*full interview* |publisher=YouTube |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>

From 1996 to 2005, she was contracted by ''[[60 Minutes]]'' creator [[Don Hewitt]] to file four to five in-depth international news reports a year as a special contributor. These reports garnered her a [[Peabody Award]] in 1998<ref name="58th Annual Peabody Awards">[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/personal-award-christiane-amanpour-for-international-reporting 58th Annual Peabody Awards], May 1999.</ref> (she had earlier been awarded one in 1993<ref name="53rd Annual Peabody Awards">[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/personal-award-christiane-amanpour 53rd Annual Peabody Awards], May 1994.</ref>). Hewitt's successor [[Jeff Fager]] was not a fan of her work and terminated her contract.

She has had many memorable moments in her television career, one of them in a live telephone interview with [[Yasser Arafat]] during the siege on his compound in March 2002, in which Arafat gave tough responses: "Are you asking me why am I under complete siege? You're a wonderful journalist. You have to respect your profession."<ref name="multipla">{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0203/29/bn.26.html|title=Israeli Troops Surround Arafat Compound|publisher=CNN|date=29 March 2002|accessdate=28 November 2007}}</ref> and "You have to be accurately [sic] when you are speaking with General Yasser Arafat. Be quiet!",<ref name="multipla" /> and finished by hanging up on her.

===Bosnian War reporting===
On 22 December 1992, during the Bosnian War, Amanpour was reporting from Kiseljak, not far from Sarajevo. Kiseljak was in Croat hands, undamaged, and ostensibly well supplied with necessities. Amanpour reported that, "While people in Sarajevo are dying from starvation, the Serbs are living [in Kiseljak] in plenty", a report that was subsequently criticised by some analysts as spreading "misinformation" and "beautiful lies".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guskova.ru/misc/balcan/I_Accuse/24|title=Guskova: Who is spreading disinformation, who is telling all the lies|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726100013/http://guskova.ru/misc/balcan/I_Accuse/24|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On 9 October 1994, [[Stephen Kinzer]] of ''The New York Times'' criticised Amanpour's coverage, in general, of the Bosnian War. Kinzer quoted a colleague's description of Amanpour as she reported on a terrorist [[bombing]] in the [[Markale massacres|Markale]] marketplace of the Bosnian city of [[Sarajevo]]:

<blockquote>[Christiane Amanpour] was sitting in [[Belgrade]] when that marketplace massacre happened, and she went on the air to say that the [[Serbs]] had probably done it. There was no way she could have known that. She was assuming an omniscience which no journalist has.<ref>(2007-10-04). [http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=3&x_outlet=14&x_article=1370 "Amanpour's Troubling Journalism"] by Steven Stotsky, CAMERA, 4 October 2004</ref></blockquote>

Amanpour has responded to the criticism leveled on her reporting from the war in the former Yugoslavia for "lack of neutrality", stating:

<blockquote>Some people accused me of being pro-Muslim in Bosnia, but I realized that our job is to give all sides an equal hearing, but in cases of genocide you can't just be neutral. You can't just say, "Well, this little boy was shot in the head and killed in besieged Sarajevo and that guy over there did it, but maybe he was upset because he had an argument with his wife." No, there is no equality there, and we had to tell the truth.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/aug/15/television "What we do is really tough"] by Julie Ferry, ''[[The Guardian]]'' (London), 15 August 2007</ref></blockquote>

==ABC News==
On 18 March 2010, Amanpour announced she would leave CNN for ABC News, where she would anchor ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]''. She said, "I'm thrilled to be joining the incredible team at ABC News. Being asked to anchor ''This Week'' in the superb tradition started by [[David Brinkley]] is a tremendous and rare honor, and I look forward to discussing the great domestic and international issues of the day. I leave CNN with the utmost respect, love, and admiration for the company and everyone who works here. This has been my family and shared endeavor for the past 27 years, and I am forever grateful and proud of all that we have accomplished."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/03/18/christiane-amanpour-to-join-abc-news/?hpt=T2 | publisher=CNN | title=Christiane Amanpour to join ABC News | accessdate=30 April 2010 | date=18 March 2010}}</ref> She hosted her first broadcast on 1 August 2010.

On 13 December 2011, ABC announced Amanpour would be leaving her post as anchor of ABC News' ''This Week'' on 8 January 2012, and returning to CNN International, where she had previously worked for 27 years, and maintaining a reporting role at ABC News.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/stephanopoulos-back-to-replace-amanpour-at-abcs-this-week-will-remain-host-of-gma/2011/12/13/gIQAUtxUsO_story.html|title=Sorry, we can't seem to find the page you're looking for.|date=13 December 2011|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com}}</ref>

==Return to CNN==

A day later on 14 December 2011, in statements by ABC and CNN, it was announced that, in a "unique arrangement", Amanpour would begin hosting a program on CNN International in 2012, while continuing at ABC News as a global affairs anchor.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/13/world/cnn-amanpour/index.html?hpt=hp_bn4 "Amanpour to return to CNN"] CNN, 14 December 2011</ref>

It was later revealed that in the spring of 2012, CNN International would refresh its line-up, putting the interview show ''[[Amanpour]]'' back on air.<ref>{{cite news |title='Amanpour': Christiane Amanpour's CNN International Show Launching in Spring |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/01/christiane-amanpours-cnn-show_n_1247650.html |work=The Huffington Post |date=1 February 2012 |first=Katherine |last=Fung |accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref> On-air promotions said she would return to CNN International on 16 April. Her 30-minute New York-recorded show — to be screened twice an evening — would mean that the US parent network's ''[[Piers Morgan Tonight]]'' interview show would be "bumped" out of its 9:00&nbsp;p.m. (Central European Time) slot to midnight (CET).<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/piers-morgan-tonight-christiane-amanpour-cnn-international-286641 "Christiane Amanpour Bumps Piers Morgan on CNN International"], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', 2 February 2012. Retrieved 30 March 2012.</ref>

On 9 September 2013, the show and staff were moved to the CNN International office and the show is currently being produced and broadcast from London.

On 7 January 2015, Amanpour made headlines during a "Breaking News" segment on CNN by referring to the Islamic extremists  who murdered the 12 journalists at ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' as "activists": "On this day, these activists found their targets, and their targets were journalists. This was a clear attack on the freedom of expression, on the press, and on satire".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/10/christiane-amanpour-calls-charlie-hebdo-terrorists/|title=Christiane Amanpour calls Charlie Hebdo terrorists 'activists'; CNN star slammed by Greg Gutfeld|first=The Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|publisher=}}</ref>

On 12 November 2020, Amanpour compared the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] to the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and [[Kristallnacht]], saying "It was the Nazis' warning shot across the bow of our human civilization that led to genocide against a whole identity, and in that tower of burning books, it led to an attack on fact, knowledge, history and truth. After four years of a modern-day assault on those same values by Donald Trump, the [[Biden-Harris Transition|Biden-Harris]] team pledges a return to norms, including the truth." The Israeli government, along with some Jewish groups, called for Amanpour to apologize for this comparison. Israeli Disapora Affairs Minister [[Omer Yankelevich]] urged an "immediate and public apology" for "belittling of the immense tragedy of the Holocaust."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Alexandra Hutzler On 11/13/20 at 11:32 AM EST|date=2020-11-13|title=CNN under fire for segment comparing Trump's tenure to Nazi Germany|url=https://www.newsweek.com/cnn-under-fire-segment-comparing-trumps-tenure-nazi-germany-1547258|access-date=2020-11-16|website=Newsweek|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Ahren|first=Raphael|title=Israel calls on CNN's Amanpour to apologize for comparing Trump to Nazis|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-calls-on-cnns-amanpour-to-apologize-for-comparing-trump-to-nazis/|access-date=2020-11-16|website=www.timesofisrael.com|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=CNN's Christiane Amanpour compares Trump-era to Kristallnacht|url=https://www.jpost.com/us-elections/cnns-christiane-amanpour-compares-trump-era-to-kristallnacht-649016|access-date=2020-11-16|website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Stance on Syria===

In late 2013, Amanpour raised the argument for intervention in Syria against the Assad government, which has been fighting [[Syrian opposition]] forces. She has appeared on several news programmes in the UK and criticized the [[Obama administration]] for its non-interventionist approach to Syria. Her advocacy for intervention was criticized by Michael S. Lofgren in ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-s-lofgren/christiane-amanpour-shill_b_3236711.html "Christiane Amanpour Shills for U.S. Intervention in Syria"] Huffington Post, July 8, 2013</ref>

==PBS==
In May 2018, it was announced that Amanpour would permanently replace [[Charlie Rose]] on [[PBS]] after he left due to allegations of sexual misconduct.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/08/media/christiane-amanpour-program-pbs/index.html?subid=22645325&CMP=patriarchy|title=Christiane Amanpour named as Charlie Rose's official replacement|last=Stelter|first=Brian|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref> Her new program, ''[[Amanpour & Company]]'', premiered on PBS on September 10, 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Koblin |first1=John |title=Christiane Amanpour Takes the Old 'Charlie Rose' Slot on PBS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/09/business/media/christiane-amanpour-pbs-charlie-rose.html |accessdate=September 9, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 9, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> From the time of Charlie Rose's departure from PBS until the new show premiered, ''Amanpour'' was aired on PBS stations, as ''Amanpour on PBS''.

In 2020, Christiane Amanpour has been doing the PBS daily program, Amanpour & Co., from her home in England, due to the Covid-19 global pandemic.  Her program continues to be seen on television on PBS at many stations in various areas of the USA, including at least 4 TV stations in the greater Los Angeles region of southern California.

==Screen and media appearances==
