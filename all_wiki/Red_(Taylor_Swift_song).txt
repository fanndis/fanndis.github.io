"'''Red'''" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] for her fourth studio album [[Red (Taylor Swift album)|of the same name]] (2012). It was released on October 2, 2012, in the United States by [[Big Machine Records]] as the second [[Promotional recording#Countdown to album release programs|promotional single]] from ''Red'' and eventually served as the album's fifth official [[single (music)|single]] on June 21, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gfa.radioandrecords.com/publishGFA/GFANextPage.asp?sDate=06/24/2013&Format=4 |title=®R&R :: Going For Adds™ :: Country |publisher=Gfa.radioandrecords.com |date=June 24, 2013 |accessdate=July 27, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015090709/http://gfa.radioandrecords.com/publishGFA/GFANextPage.asp?sDate=06%2F24%2F2013&Format=4 |archivedate=October 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It was one of the tracks released during the four weeks preceding the release of the album.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williott|first=Carl|title=Taylor Swift's 'Red' Nabs Countdown Campaign With iTunes & 'Good Morning America'|url=http://idolator.com/6927062/taylor-swift-red-countdown-itunes-good-morning-america|work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|publisher=[[Buzz Media]]|accessdate=October 2, 2012|date=September 21, 2012|archive-date=July 2, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702225832/http://www.idolator.com/6927062/taylor-swift-red-countdown-itunes-good-morning-america|url-status=live}}</ref> Musically, "Red" is a country song, and its lyrics use colors and metaphors to describe an intense and tumultuous relationship.

The track received generally positive reviews from [[music critics]], who praised its lyrics, but were ambivalent towards its composition. The song debuted at number six on the [[Billboard 100|''Billboard'' 100]] chart in the United States and at number one on the [[Hot Digital Songs]] component chart. Also in the United States, the song debuted at number two on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, behind the album's lead single "[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]".

==Background==
Swift previewed the track on the October 1, 2012 episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Good Morning America]]''. The song finds Swift playing with the idea of colors in relation to her emotions about a relationship. Before playing the track, Swift explained its meaning: "I wrote this song about the fact that some things are just hard to forget," she said, "because the emotions involved with them were so intense and, to me, intense emotion is red."  Swift explained that she decided to name this song as her album title, as its lyrics encompass the entire theme of the project. "Thinking about what that means to me and all the different emotions that are written about on this album – they're all pretty much about the sexy, crazy, insane, intense, semi-toxic relationships that I've experienced in the last two years," I noted. "All those emotions – spanning from intense love, intense frustration, jealousy, confusion – in my mind, all those emotions are red. There's nothing in between; there is nothing beige about any of those feelings."

Swift explained to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. "I think the reason I said that was because I made the record exactly the same way I made the last three. I knew I hadn't jumped out of my comfort zone, which at the time was writing alone and working with Nathan. ["Red"] the song was a real turning point for ''Red'' the album. When I wrote that song my mind started wandering to all the places we could go. If I were to think outside the box enough, go in with different people, I could learn from and have what they do rub off on me as well as have what I do rub off on them."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107859438859/| title=Swift explains why ''Red'' was chosen as the album title| date=December 15, 2012| access-date=December 15, 2012| archive-date=December 19, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219154616/http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3530822107859438859| url-status=live}}</ref>

Swift seems to look back with uncertainty at her 2012 feeling that love is "red" in the song "Daylight" from her 2019 album ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]''. In the song, she sings, "I once believed love would be burnin’ red. But it's golden. Like daylight."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/46536068|title=Taylor Swift's Subtle Red Reference in "Daylight" Proves Just How Much She Loves Joe Alwyn|last=Cullum|first=Erin|date=2019-09-02|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-21}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Taylor Swift performing 'Red'.jpg|thumbnail|right|Swift performing "[[Red (Taylor Swift song)|Red]]" during her concert in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]]] -->
Marc Hogan of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' felt the mixed influences didn't work in Swift's favor: "A glossy soft rocker with a stomping four-on-the-floor beat, back-porch twang, adult-contemporary orchestration, and Top 40-ready electronic vocal effects, it covers a bizarre number of bases. And the key lyric compares her lost love, mourned here as an object of desire but not kissed off as one of the usual jerks, to 'driving a new Maserati down a dead end street,' like Swift is about to brawl with [[Rick Ross]]."<ref name=Spin>{{cite web |last=Hogan |first=Marc |url=https://www.spin.com/2012/10/taylor-swift-red-listen/ |title=Hear Taylor Swift's Maserati-Themed 'Red' Title Track |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=October 2, 2012 |accessdate=October 2, 2012 |archive-date=October 26, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026202725/http://www.spin.com/2012/10/taylor-swift-red-listen/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Grady Smith of ''Entertainment Weekly'', joked, saying: "Those are the only colors the song — which Swift says is all about 'intense emotion' — brings up, which kind of let me down. (...) I'm being serious — I kept waiting for some other hue to pop up, and it never did.(... And then, said: "Lyrically, (...) [some] lines (...) lack the crisp, powerful punch that Swift usually delivers. And in a song all about the vividness of feelings, they paint a rather blurry portrait. (...) Where is the drama, the sexiness, the freefall of passion? The poppy production white-washes over all that. That doesn't mean this is a bad song, just maybe an underwhelming one."<ref>{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Grady |url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2012/10/02/taylor-swift-red/ |title=Taylor Swift explains her personal rainbow of emotions on 'Red' |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=October 2, 2012 |accessdate=October 2, 2012 |archive-date=November 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112183346/http://music-mix.ew.com/2012/10/02/taylor-swift-red/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Rebecca Macatee of ''E! Online'', found the lyrics to be a rainbow of fruit flavors: "She...goes through myriad colors to describe her feelings...

(...) The only unique thing about the song is the thing I can't stand, the electronic 'R-R-Red' that repeats after the chorus."

One of the more positive reviews came from Billy Dukes of ''Taste of Country,'' who gave the track 4.5 out of 5 stars. Said Dukes: "...'Red' is arguably the best lyric on the album. It's a songwriting spotlight for Swift, who toys with colors like a skilled artist, and this song is her Sistine Chapel."<ref name=tasteofcountry>{{cite web |last=Dukes |first=Billy |url=http://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-red-song/ |title=Taylor Swift, 'Red' – Song Review |work=Taste of Country |publisher=[[Townsquare Media]] |date=June 11, 2013 |accessdate=July 27, 2013 |archive-date=November 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104191433/http://tasteofcountry.com/taylor-swift-red-song/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Estelle Tang of ''Elle Magazine'' named 'Red' the 6th best love song of all time saying "Here's one for those dwelling in the past: Taylor Swift's "Red" isn't about a current love affair, but one that's come and gone.
