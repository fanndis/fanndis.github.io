The '''Privy Council of the United Kingdom'''{{refn|group=n|Officially '''Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council''' or known simply as the '''Privy Council'''}} is a [[privy council|formal body of advisers]] to the [[British monarchy|sovereign]] of the United Kingdom. Its membership mainly comprises [[Politics of the United Kingdom|senior politician]]s who are current or former members of either the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] or the [[House of Lords]].

The Privy Council formally advises the sovereign on the exercise of the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]], and as a body corporate (as [[Queen-in-Council]]) it issues [[Executive (government)|executive instruments]] known as [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]], which among other powers enact [[Acts of Parliament]]. The Council also holds the delegated authority to issue [[Orders of Council]], mostly used to regulate certain public institutions. The Council advises the sovereign on the issuing of [[Royal Charter]]s, which are used to grant special status to incorporated bodies, and [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]] or [[borough]] status to local authorities. Otherwise, the Privy Council's powers have now been largely replaced by its executive committee, the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]].

Certain judicial functions are also performed by the Queen-in-Council, although in practice its actual work of hearing and deciding upon cases is carried out day-to-day by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. The Judicial Committee consists of [[List of Lords Justices of Appeal|senior judges]] appointed as privy counsellors: predominantly [[Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Justices]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] and [[senior judge]]s from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The Privy Council formerly acted as the [[Supreme court|High Court of Appeal]] for the entire [[British Empire]] (other than for the United Kingdom itself). It continues to hear judicial appeals from some other independent [[Commonwealth countries]], as well as [[Crown dependencies]] and [[British Overseas Territories]].

==History==
{{further|Privy Council of England|Privy Council of Scotland|English law|Scots law}}
The [[Privy Council]] of the United Kingdom was preceded by the Privy Council of Scotland and the Privy Council of England. The key events in the formation of the modern Privy Council are given below:

In [[Anglo-Saxon England]], [[Witenagemot]] was an early equivalent to the [[Privy Council of England]]. During the reigns of the [[Norman Conquest|Norman monarchs]], the [[English Crown]] was advised by a [[royal court]] or ''[[curia regis]]'', which consisted of [[magnate]]s, [[ecclesiastic]]s and [[Law Officers of the Crown|high officials]]. The body originally concerned itself with advising the sovereign on legislation, administration and justice.<ref>Dicey, pp. 6–7.</ref> Later, different bodies assuming distinct functions evolved from the court. The courts of law took over the business of dispensing [[justice]], while [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] became the supreme legislature of the kingdom.<ref>Dicey, p. 24.</ref> Nevertheless, the Council retained the power to hear legal disputes, either in the first instance or on appeal.<ref>Dicey, pp. 12–14.</ref> Furthermore, laws made by the sovereign on the advice of the Council, rather than on the advice of Parliament, were accepted as valid.<ref name="gay-p2">Gay, p. 2.</ref> Powerful sovereigns often used the body to circumvent the Courts and Parliament.<ref name="gay-p2"/> For example, a committee of the Council—which later became the [[Star Chamber|Court of the Star Chamber]]—was during the 15th century permitted to inflict any punishment except death, without being bound by normal [[trial|court procedure]].<ref>Maitland, pp. 262–3.</ref> During [[Henry VIII]]'s reign, the sovereign, on the advice of the Council, was allowed to enact laws by mere proclamation. The legislative pre-eminence of Parliament was not restored until after Henry VIII's death.<ref>Maitland, p. 253.</ref> Though the royal Council retained legislative and judicial responsibilities, it became a primarily administrative body.<ref>Goodnow, p. 123</ref> The Council consisted of forty members in 1553,<ref>Maitland, p. 256.</ref> but the sovereign relied on a smaller committee, which later evolved into the modern [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]].

By the end of the [[English Civil War]], the monarchy, House of Lords, and Privy Council had been abolished. The remaining [[Chambers of parliament|parliamentary chamber]], the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], instituted a [[English Council of State|Council of State]] to execute laws and to direct administrative policy. The forty-one members of the Council were elected by the House of Commons; the body was headed by [[Oliver Cromwell]], ''de facto'' military dictator of the nation. In 1653, however, Cromwell became [[Lord Protector]], and the Council was reduced to between thirteen and twenty-one members, all elected by the Commons. In 1657, the Commons granted Cromwell even greater powers, some of which were reminiscent of those enjoyed by monarchs. The Council became known as the [[Protector's Privy Council]]; its members were appointed by the Lord Protector, subject to Parliament's approval.<ref name="plant">{{cite web |last=Plant |first=D |url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/council-state.htm |title=The Council of State |work=British Civil Wars, Commonwealth and Protectorate, 1638–60 |year=2007 |accessdate=11 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926000618/http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/council-state.htm |archive-date=26 September 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1659, shortly before the [[English Restoration|restoration of the monarchy]], the Protector's Council was abolished.<ref name="plant"/> [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] restored the Royal Privy Council, but he, like previous [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] monarchs, chose to rely on a small group of advisers.<ref>Warshaw, p. 7.</ref> Under [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] even more power transferred to this committee. It now began to meet in the absence of the sovereign, communicating its decisions to him after the fact.

Thus, the British Privy Council, as a whole, ceased to be a body of important confidential advisers to the sovereign; the role passed to a committee of the Council, now known as the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]].<ref>Gay and Rees, pp. 2–3.</ref>

The sovereign, when acting on the Council's advice, is known as the ''[[King-in-Council]]'' or ''[[Queen-in-Council]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblywales.org/legislativecompetenceorders.pdf |title=Legislative Competence Orders |work=Constitutional Quick Guides No. 3 |publisher=Welsh Assembly |year=2007 |accessdate=12 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001162114/http://www.assemblywales.org/legislativecompetenceorders.pdf |archive-date=1 October 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> The members of the Council are collectively known as ''The Lords of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council''<ref>e.g. {{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1988/Uksi_19881162_en_1.htm |title=Statutory Instrument 1988 No.&nbsp;1162 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=11 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808181939/https://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1988/Uksi_19881162_en_1.htm |archive-date=8 August 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> (sometimes ''The Lords and others of&nbsp;...'').<ref>e.g. {{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1999/19991379.htm |title=Statutory Instrument 1999 No.&nbsp;1379 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=11 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809102633/https://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1999/19991379.htm |archive-date=9 August 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> The chief officer of the body is the [[Lord President of the Council]], who is the fourth highest [[Great Officer of State]],<ref>H.&nbsp;Cox, p. 388.</ref> a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet member]] and normally, either the Leader of the House of Lords or of the House of Commons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/files/pdf/Business%20Plan.pdf |title=Departmental Plan 2004/05 |publisher=Privy Council Office |accessdate=11 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001162114/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/files/pdf/Business%20Plan.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2008 }}</ref> Another important official is the [[Clerk of the Privy Council (United Kingdom)|Clerk]], whose signature is appended to all orders made in the Council.<ref>Brazier, p. 199, note 109.</ref>

Both ''Privy Counsellor'' and ''Privy Councillor'' may be correctly used to refer to a member of the Council. The former, however, is preferred by the [[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council Office]],<ref name="business-faq">{{cite web|title=Privy Council Office FAQs|url=http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/work-of-the-privy-council-office/faqs/|publisher=Privy Council Office|accessdate=13 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405035812/http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/work-of-the-privy-council-office/faqs/|archive-date=5 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> emphasising English usage of the term ''Counsellor'' as "one who gives [[counsel]]", as opposed to "one who is a member of a council". A Privy Counsellor is traditionally said to be "''sworn of''" the Council after being received by the sovereign.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=56070|date=30 December 2000|page=1 |supp=y}}</ref>

The sovereign may appoint anyone a Privy Counsellor,<ref>Blackstone, I. 174.</ref> but in practice appointments are made only on the advice of [[Her Majesty's Government]]. The majority of appointees are senior politicians, including Ministers of the Crown, the few most senior figures of the [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Loyal Opposition]], the Parliamentary leader of the third-largest party, a couple of the most senior figures in the devolved British governments and senior politicians from Commonwealth countries. Besides these, the Council includes a very few members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] (usually the [[Prince consort|consort]] and [[heir apparent]] only), a few dozen judges from British and Commonwealth countries, a few clergy and a small number of senior civil servants.

There is no statutory limit to its membership.<ref name="gay-p3">Gay, p. 3.</ref> Members have no automatic right to attend all Privy Council meetings, and only some are summoned regularly to meetings (in practice at the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]'s discretion).

The [[Church of England]]'s three senior bishops – the [[archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[archbishop of York]]<ref name="gay-p3"/> and the [[bishop of London]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.london.anglican.org/BishopOfLondon |title=Bishop of London |publisher=Diocese of London |accessdate=15 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509125958/http://www.london.anglican.org/BishopOfLondon |archivedate=9 May 2008 }}</ref> – become privy counsellors upon appointment.

The balance of privy counsellors is largely made up of politicians. The Prime Minister, [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] [[Minister (government)|ministers]] and the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of HM Opposition]] are traditionally sworn of the Privy Council upon appointment.<ref name="gay-p3"/> Leaders of major [[political parties in the United Kingdom|parties]] in the House of Commons, [[First Minister]]s of the [[devolution|devolved assemblies]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/848851.stm |title=Morgan made Privy Counsellor |publisher=BBC |date=24 July 2000 |accessdate=12 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830131047/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/848851.stm |archive-date=30 August 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> some senior Ministers outside Cabinet, and on occasion other respected senior parliamentarians are appointed privy counsellors.

Because privy counsellors are bound by [[oath]] to keep matters discussed at Council meetings secret, the appointment of the leaders of opposition parties as privy counsellors allows the Government to share confidential information with them "on Privy Council terms".<ref name="gay-p3"/> This usually only happens in special circumstances, such as in matters of [[national security]]. For example, [[Tony Blair]] met [[Iain Duncan Smith]] (then Leader of HM Opposition) and [[Charles Kennedy]] (then [[Leader of the Liberal Democrats]]) "on Privy Council terms" to discuss the [[September Dossier|evidence for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction]].<ref name="so-what">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2589087.stm |title=So what is the Privy Council? |publisher=BBC |date=18 February 2003 |accessdate=12 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726205801/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2589087.stm |archive-date=26 July 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Although the Privy Council is primarily a British institution, officials from some other [[Commonwealth realm]]s are also appointed.<ref name="gay-p3"/> By 2000, the most notable instance was New Zealand, whose [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]], senior politicians, Chief Justice and Court of Appeal Justices were traditionally appointed Privy Counsellors.<ref name="nz-pc">{{cite web |url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/overview/honourable_privycouncil.html |title=The title 'The Honourable' and the Privy Council |work=New Zealand Honours |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=3 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703221643/http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/overview/honourable_privycouncil.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=3 July 2008}}</ref> However, appointments of New Zealand members have since been discontinued.

Full meetings of the Privy Council are held only when the reigning sovereign announces their own engagement (which last happened on 23 November 1839,<ref>''The Times'', 25 November 1839, p. 5.</ref> in the reign of [[Queen Victoria]]); or when there is a [[demise of the Crown]], either by the death or abdication of the monarch.<ref name="so-what"/> A full meeting of the Privy Council was also held on 6 February 1811, when the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] was sworn in as [[regent]] by [[Regency Acts|Act of Parliament]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/16450/pages/221|title=Gazette of 7 February 1811|newspaper=The London Gazette|accessdate=13 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507025955/http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/16450/pages/221|archive-date=7 May 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Regency Acts|current statutes regulating the establishment of a regency]] in the case of minority or incapacity of the sovereign also require any regents to swear their oaths before the Privy Council.<ref>Regency Act 1937, Sect. 2.2 and 4.1.</ref>

In the case of a demise of the Crown, the Privy Council – together with the [[Lords Spiritual]], the [[Lords Temporal]], the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|lord mayor]] and [[Court of Aldermen|aldermen]] of the [[City of London]] as well as representatives of [[Commonwealth realm]]s – makes a proclamation declaring the accession of the new sovereign and receives an oath from the new monarch relating to the security of the [[Church of Scotland]], as required by law. It is also customary for the new sovereign to make an [[allocution]] to the Privy Council on that occasion, and this Sovereign's Speech is formally published in ''The [[London Gazette]]''. Any such Special Assembly of the Privy Council, convened to proclaim the accession of a new sovereign and witness the monarch's statutory oath, is known as an [[Accession Council]]. The last such meetings were held on 6 and 8 February 1952: as [[Elizabeth II]] was abroad when the last [[demise of the Crown]] took place, the Accession Council met twice, once to proclaim the sovereign (meeting of 6 February 1952), and then again after the new queen had returned to Britain, to receive from her the oath required by statute (meeting of 8 February 1952).<ref>''[[The Times]]'', 7 February 1952, p. 6; ''The Times'', 8 February 1952, p. 6.</ref>

==Functions==
The sovereign exercises executive authority by making [[orders in council]] upon the advice of the Privy Council. Orders-in-council, which are drafted by the [[Her Majesty's Government|government]] rather than by the sovereign, are secondary legislation and are used to make government regulations and to make government appointments. Furthermore, orders-in-council are used to grant [[royal assent]] for [[Measures of the National Assembly for Wales]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/32/contents/data.htm|title=Government of Wales Act 2006|first=Expert|last=Participation|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411023617/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/32/contents/data.htm|archive-date=11 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/wales/mwa2008/oic/mwaoic_20080001_en.pdf Order in Council] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219075253/http://opsi.gov.uk/legislation/wales/mwa2008/oic/mwaoic_20080001_en.pdf |date=19 February 2009 }} dated 9 July 2008, approving The NHS Redress (Wales) Measure 2008, the first Measure to be passed by the Assembly on 6 May 2008.

Distinct from orders-in-council are [[orders of council]]: the former are issued by the sovereign upon the advice of the Privy Council, whereas the latter are made by members of the Privy Council without requiring the sovereign's approval. They are issued under the specific authority of [[Acts of Parliament]], and most commonly are used for the regulation of [[public institution]]s.<ref name="factsheet-l7"/>

===Accession Council===
The [[Accession Council]] is made up of privy counsellors, [[great officers of state]], members of the House of Lords, the [[lord mayor of the City of London]], the [[Court of Aldermen|aldermen of the City of London]], [[high commissioners of Commonwealth realms]], and senior civil servants. It is a ceremonial body which assembles in [[St James's Palace]] upon the death of a monarch, to make formal proclamation of the accession of the successor to the throne.

===Baronetage Committee===
The [[Standing Council of the Baronetage|Baronetage Committee]] was established by a 1910 order in council, during [[Edward VII]]'s reign, to scrutinise all succession claims (and thus reject doubtful ones) to be placed on the [[Official Roll of the Baronetage|Roll of Baronets]].<ref name="whatdotheyknow" />

===Cabinet of the United Kingdom===
The [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]] is the collective decision-making body of Her Majesty's Government of the United Kingdom, composed of the prime minister and 21 cabinet ministers, the most senior of the government ministers.

===Committee for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey===
The [[Politics of Jersey|Committee for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey]] recommends approval of [[Channel Islands]] legislation.<ref name="whatdotheyknow" />

===Committee for the Purposes of the Crown Office Act 1877===
The Committee for the purposes of the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Crown Office Act 1877]] consists of the [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Lord Privy Seal]] as well as a secretary of state. The Committee, which last met in 1988, is concerned with the design and usage of [[Seal (contract law)|wafer seals]].<ref name="whatdotheyknow" />

===Judicial Committee of the Privy Council===
The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]],<ref>N.&nbsp;Cox, ''Abolition or Retention of the Privy Council'', Sect.&nbsp;2.</ref> consists of senior judges who are Privy Counsellors.<ref name="gay-p6">Gay and Rees, p. 6.</ref> The decision of the Committee is presented in the form of "advice" to the monarch, but in practice it is always followed by the sovereign (as Crown-in-Council), who formally approves the recommendation of the Judicial Committee.<ref>Maitland, p. 463.</ref>

Within the United Kingdom, the Judicial Committee hears appeals from [[ecclesiastical courts]], the [[Admiralty court|Court of Admiralty]] of the [[Cinque Ports]], [[prize court]]s and the Disciplinary Committee of the [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]], appeals against schemes of the [[Church Commissioners]] and appeals under certain Acts of Parliament (e.g., the [[House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975]]).<ref name="pco-jurisdiction">{{cite web |url=http://www.jcpc.uk/about/role-of-the-jcpc.html |title=Role of the JCPC |publisher=Judicial Committee of the Privy Council |accessdate=13 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114165910/http://www.jcpc.uk/about/role-of-the-jcpc.html |archive-date=14 January 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Crown-in-Council was formerly the [[Court of Appeal|Supreme Appeal Court]] for the entire [[British Empire]],<ref>Iwi, p. 128.</ref> but a number of Commonwealth countries have now abolished the right to such appeals.<ref>N.&nbsp;Cox, ''Abolition or Retention of the Privy Council'', Sect.&nbsp;11.</ref> The Judicial Committee continues to hear appeals from several Commonwealth countries, from [[British Overseas Territories]], [[Sovereign Base Area]]s and [[Crown dependencies]].<ref name="pco-jurisdiction"/> The Judicial Committee had direct jurisdiction in cases relating to the [[Scotland Act 1998]], the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]] and the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]], but this was transferred to the new [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] in 2009.<ref name="gay-p6"/>

===Lords Commissioners===
The [[Lords Commissioners]] are privy counsellors appointed by the Monarch of the United Kingdom to exercise, on their behalf, certain functions relating to Parliament which would otherwise require the monarch's attendance at the [[Palace of Westminster]]. These include the opening and [[prorogation]] of Parliament, the confirmation of a newly elected [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|speaker of the House of Commons]] and the granting of royal assent.  In current practice, the lords commissioners usually include the lord chancellor, the archbishop of Canterbury, the leaders of the three major parties in the House of Lords, the convener of the House of Lords [[Crossbenchers]], and the [[lord speaker]].

===Scottish Universities Committee===
The [[Ancient universities of Scotland|Scottish Universities Committee]] considers proposed amendments to the statutes of Scotland's four ancient universities.<ref name="whatdotheyknow" />  

===Universities Committee===
The [[Universities in the United Kingdom|Universities Committee]], which last met in 1995, considers [[petition]]s against statutes made by Oxford and Cambridge universities and their colleges.<ref name="whatdotheyknow" />

===Other Committees===
In addition to the Standing Committees, ''ad hoc'' Committees are notionally set up to consider and report on petitions for [[royal charter]]s of Incorporation and to approve changes to the [[bye-law]]s of [[corporate body|bodies]] created by royal charter.<ref name="whatdotheyknow" />

Committees of privy counsellors are occasionally established to examine specific issues. Such committees are independent of the
Privy Council Office and therefore do not report directly to the lord president of the council.<ref name="whatdotheyknow" /> Examples of such committees include:<ref name="whatdotheyknow" />
* the [[Butler Review|Butler Committee]] – operation of the intelligence services in the runup to military intervention in Iraq
* the Chilcot Committee – for the [[Chilcot Inquiry]] on the use of intercept materials
* the [[Peter Gibson|Gibson Committee]] of enquiry set up in 2010 – to consider whether the [[UK security services]] were complicit in torture of detainees.

==Notable orders==

The [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]] is formally governed by [[Privy Council Orders]], as an exercise of the [[royal prerogative]]. One such order implemented HM Government's ban of [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] staff from joining a Trade Union.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8046523.stm | work=BBC News | title=Do we need the Privy Council? | date=13 May 2009 | accessdate=2 April 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903214229/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8046523.stm | archive-date=3 September 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XiuTL7Q-6CwC&pg=PA8 |title=ThirdWay—Google Boeken |date= March 1984|accessdate=13 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507025958/http://books.google.com/books?id=XiuTL7Q-6CwC&pg=PA8 |archive-date=7 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Another, the Civil Service (Amendment) Order in Council 1997, permitted the Prime Minister to grant up to three [[Special advisers in the United Kingdom|political advisers]] management authority over some Civil Servants.<ref name=BBC090512 /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/web-resources/resources/a6831c096d4.pdf|title=Civil Service Order in Council 1995 (as amended between 1995 and 2005)|accessdate=7 June 2010|publisher=Civil Service Commissioners|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704105311/http://www.civilservicecommissioners.org/web-resources/resources/a6831c096d4.pdf|archivedate=4 July 2008}}</ref>

In the 1960s, the Privy Council made an order to evict the 2,000 inhabitants of the 65-island [[Chagos Archipelago]] in the Indian Ocean, in preparation for the establishment of a joint United States–United Kingdom military base on the largest outlying island, [[Diego Garcia]], some {{convert|60|mi|km}} distant. In 2000 the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] ruled the [[Immigration Act 1971|1971 Immigration Ordinance]] preventing resettlement unlawful. In 2004, the Privy Council, under [[Jack Straw]]'s tenure, overturned the ruling. In 2006 the [[High Court of Justice]] found the Privy Council's decision to be unlawful. [[Sydney Kentridge|Sir Sydney Kentridge]] described the treatment of the [[Chagossians]] as "outrageous, unlawful and a breach of accepted moral standards": Justice Kentridge stated that there was no known [[precedent]] "for the lawful use of prerogative powers to remove or exclude an entire population of British subjects from their homes and place of birth",<ref name=BBC090512>[[BBC Radio 4]]—[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00k8frh What's the Point of ...

==Rights and privileges of members==

The Privy Council as a whole is termed "[[The Most Honourable]]" whilst its members individually, the Privy Counsellors, are entitled to be [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] "[[The Right Honourable]]".<ref>{{cite web |title= Privy Council members |url= http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/privy-council/privy-council-members/ |website= Privy Council Office |access-date= 15 June 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141206223159/http://privycouncil.independent.gov.uk/privy-council/privy-council-members/ |archive-date= 6 December 2014 |url-status= live }}</ref>

Each Privy Counsellor has the right of personal access to the sovereign. Peers were considered to enjoy this right individually; members of the House of Commons possess the right collectively. In each case, personal access may only be used to tender advice on [[public policy|public affairs]].<ref name="cox-25">N.&nbsp;Cox, ''Peerage Privileges'', pp. 25–6.</ref>

Only Privy Counsellors can signify royal consent to the examination of a [[Bill (law)|Bill]] affecting the rights of the Crown.<ref>Hayter, Sect.&nbsp;7.177.</ref>

Members of the Privy Council are privileged to be given advance notice of any [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime ministerial]] decision to commit [[HM Armed Forces]] in [[Military operation|enemy action]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Jones informed of Syria drone strike |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-34196761 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=17 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912004806/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-34196761 |archive-date=12 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Privy Counsellors have the right to sit on the steps of the Sovereign's Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords during debates, a privilege which was shared with [[heirs apparent]] of those [[hereditary peerage|hereditary peer]]s who were to become members of the [[House of Lords]] before Labour's partial [[House of Lords Act 1999|Reform of the Lords]] in 1999, diocesan bishops of the [[Church of England]] yet to be [[Lords Spiritual]], retired bishops who formerly sat in the House of Lords, the [[Dean of Westminster]], [[Peerage of Ireland|Peers of Ireland]], the [[Clerk of the Crown in Chancery]], and the [[Black Rod|Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]].<ref>Hayter, Sect.&nbsp;1.37.</ref> While Privy Counsellors have the right to sit on the steps of the Sovereign's Throne they do so only as observers and are not allowed to participate in any of the workings of the House of Lords. Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised. A notable recent instance of the exercising of this privilege was used by the Prime Minister, [[Theresa May]], and [[David Lidington]], who watched the opening of the debate of the [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017]] in the House of Lords.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39020260|title=Respect Brexit decision, peers urged|publisher=BBC|date=20 February 2017|access-date=20 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220041140/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39020260|archive-date=20 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

All those sworn of the Privy Council are accorded the style "The Right Honourable", but some nobles automatically have higher styles: [[Duke|non-royal dukes]] are styled "[[The Most Noble]]" and marquesses, "[[The Most Honourable]]".

==Other councils==
The Privy Council is one of the four principal councils of the sovereign. The other three are the courts of law, the ''[[Commune Concilium]]'' (Common Council, i.e. Parliament) and the ''[[Magnum Concilium]]'' (Great Council, i.e. the assembly of all the [[peers of the realm]]). All are still in existence, or at least have never been formally abolished, but the ''Magnum Concilium'' has not been summoned since 1640 and was considered defunct even then.<ref name="cox-25"/><ref>Blackstone, I. Chapter 5.</ref>

Several other Privy Councils have advised the sovereign. England and Scotland once had separate Privy Councils (the [[Privy Council of England]] and [[Privy Council of Scotland]]). The [[Acts of Union 1707]] united the two countries into the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and in 1708 the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] abolished the Privy Council of Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|title=Privy Council Records|url=https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/research/guides/privy-council-records|publisher=National Records of Scotland|accessdate=8 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109113425/https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/research/guides/privy-council-records|archive-date=9 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Gorman|first1=Frank|title=The Long Eighteenth Century: British Political and Social History 1688–1832|date=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781472507747|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpY-CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA65|access-date=8 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190816034002/https://books.google.com/books?id=KpY-CwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA65&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=16 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Thereafter there was one Privy Council of Great Britain sitting in London.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Jeremy|title=The politics of Britain, 1688–1800|date=1993|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0719037611|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qX_W1O6XatwC&pg=PA13|access-date=8 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190816034002/https://books.google.com/books?id=qX_W1O6XatwC&lpg=PA13&pg=PA13#v=onepage&f=false|archive-date=16 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], on the other hand, continued to have a separate Privy Council even after the [[Act of Union 1800]]. The [[Privy Council of Ireland]] was abolished in 1922, when [[Irish Free State|the greater part of Ireland]] separated from the United Kingdom; it was succeeded by the [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland]], which became dormant after the suspension of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] in 1972. No further appointments have been made since then, and only three appointees were still living as of November 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://leighrayment.com/pcouncil/pcouncilI.htm|title=Privy Counsellors—Ireland|author=Rayment, Leigh|date=27 May 2014|accessdate=13 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926113756/http://www.leighrayment.com/pcouncil/pcouncilI.htm|archive-date=26 September 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>
