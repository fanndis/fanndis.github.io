{{wikisource|Category:2020 Democratic National Convention|2020 Democratic National Convention}}

[[File:Frontier Airline Center.jpg|thumb|Wisconsin Center was ultimately the main location of the convention.|283x283px]]

The '''2020 Democratic National Convention''' was a [[United States presidential nominating convention|presidential nominating convention]] that was held from August 17 to 20, 2020, at the [[Wisconsin Center]] in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], and virtually across the United States. At the convention, delegates of the United States [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] formally chose former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] [[Joe Biden]] and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Kamala Harris]] of [[California]] as the party's nominees for [[President of the United States|president]] and vice president, respectively, in the [[2020 United States presidential election]].

Originally scheduled to be held July 13–16, 2020, at the [[Fiserv Forum]] in Milwaukee, the convention was postponed to August 17–20, 2020, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|ongoing coronavirus pandemic in the United States]]. The convention was ultimately downsized, with its location shifted to the city's Wisconsin Center and most of the convention presenting remotely from sites across the United States.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the format was substantially different from previous conventions, with the duration of each day of the convention being significantly shorter than in past conventions, and with most of the convention being held remotely from many venues across the country. While being a largely virtual convention, it was officially centered at the Wisconsin Center, which is where its production was headquartered, where its roll call was directed from, and where a limited number of speeches (primarily those by Wisconsin politicians) were staged. Both Biden and Harris made their respective speeches remotely from the [[Chase Center on the Riverfront]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris went on to win the 2020 election.

==Background==
The convention was the [[List of Democratic National Conventions|49th]] Democratic National Convention.

===Role of superdelegates===
{{see also|List of 2020 Democratic Party automatic delegates}}

[[Superdelegates]] are delegates to the convention who are automatically chosen by the party, rather than by the results of primaries and caucuses. While technically unpledged, in the past many of them have informally pledged themselves to a predesignated front-runner in previous elections. The superdelegate system is controversial among Democrats, and supporters of both Clinton and Sanders have called for their removal in 2020.<ref>Gabriel Debenedetti, [https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/15/tim-kaine-end-superdelegates-244944 Kaine calls for eliminating superdelegates: Hillary Clinton's VP sides with Bernie Sanders in a fight that's divided Democrats] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722231342/https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/15/tim-kaine-end-superdelegates-244944 |date=July 22, 2018}}, ''Politico'' (November 15, 2017).</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/363829-dnc-chair-vice-chair-endorse-superdelegate-reform |title=DNC leaders call for 'significant' cut in Dem superdelegates |last=Bowden |first=John |date=December 7, 2017 |website=Thehill.com |publisher=The Hill |access-date=December 13, 2017 |archive-date=December 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213091727/http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/363829-dnc-chair-vice-chair-endorse-superdelegate-reform |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Selection of pledged delegates===
{{see also|2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries}}
The number of delegates allocated to each of the 50 states and [[Washington, D.C.]], are based on, among others, the proportion of votes each state gave to the Democratic candidate in the 2008, 2012, and 2016 presidential elections. A fixed number of pledged delegates are allocated to each of the five U.S. territories and [[Democrats Abroad primary|Democrats Abroad]].<ref name="delegateallocation">{{cite web |url=https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/D-Alloc.phtml |title=The Math Behind the Democratic Delegate Allocation 2020 |publisher=thegreenpapers.com |accessdate=January 23, 2020 |archive-date=February 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203125009/https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/D-Alloc.phtml |url-status=live}}</ref>

====Qualification of suspended campaigns====
The Democratic National Committee's 2020 selection rules state that any candidate who is no longer running loses the statewide delegates they have won and those delegates are then reallocated to candidates still in the race. However, the interpretation of this rule in 2020 races might be different than the interpretation in past races.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sanders-could-lose-a-third-of-his-delegates-making-for-a-messy-convention/ |date=April 24, 2020 |title=Sanders Could Lose A Third Of His Delegates, Making For A Messy Convention |first=Josh |last=Putnam |work=[[FiveThirtyEight]] |publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures |accessdate=May 2, 2020 |archive-date=April 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200429202636/https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sanders-could-lose-a-third-of-his-delegates-making-for-a-messy-convention/ |url-status=live}}</ref> In previous elections, such as the 2008 presidential primary, candidates would suspend their candidacies rather than formally withdraw, allowing their already pledged delegates to attend the convention and pick up new ones along the way.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/06/suspending-vs-withdrawing.html |title=Suspending vs. Withdrawing |first=Christopher |last=Beam |date=June 6, 2008 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=May 2, 2020 |archive-date=May 2, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200502011842/https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2008/06/suspending-vs-withdrawing.html | url-status = live}}</ref> {{cns|date=May 2020|They would then formally withdraw when it was too late to reallocate the delegations.}}

The Milwaukee 2020 Host Committee was established to organize the convention.

In early February 2020, Milwaukee 2020 Host Committee president Liz Gilbert and her chief-of-staff Adam Lonso were both fired after an investigation found that the committee's "work environment did not meet the ideals and expectations" of the organization's board (with allegations of a "toxic" work environment).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kirchen |first1=Rich |title=Liz Gilbert, Adam Alonso fired from Milwaukee DNC Host Committee after 'toxic work environment' investigation |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2020/02/05/liz-gilbert-adam-alonso-fired-from-milwaukee-dnc.html |website=www.bizjournals.com |publisher=Milwaukee Business Journal |accessdate=August 15, 2020 |date=February 5, 2020 |archive-date=August 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819173529/https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2020/02/05/liz-gilbert-adam-alonso-fired-from-milwaukee-dnc.html |url-status=live}}</ref> Acting as interim leader of the Host Committee was Teresa Vilmain.<ref name=newleadership/> In late February, new leadership team was announced with Raquel Filmanowicz serving as [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and Paula Penebaker serving as [[Chief operating officer|COO]], with both taking these positions formally on March 2, 2020.<ref name=newleadership>{{cite web |title=Milwaukee 2020 DNC Host Committee announces new leadership team |url=https://www.fox6now.com/news/milwaukee-2020-dnc-host-committee-announces-new-leadership-team |website=FOX 6 Now Milwaukee |accessdate=August 15, 2020 |date=February 28, 2020 |archive-date=August 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819173532/https://www.fox6now.com/news/milwaukee-2020-dnc-host-committee-announces-new-leadership-team |url-status=live}}</ref>

On June 24, 2020, it was announced that the convention was to be downsized. The venue was shifted from the Fiserv Forum to the Wisconsin Center.

===Programming===
{{Tone|section|date=June 2020}}

While the primary purpose of political conventions is, and always was, to decide who the nominees for president and vice president are to be, the secondary purpose was always that of socializing.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wpr.org/dnc-host-committee-planning-2k-events-upcoming-convention |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 8, 2020 |archive-date=October 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022090856/https://www.wpr.org/dnc-host-committee-planning-2k-events-upcoming-convention |url-status=live}}</ref> Entertainment is also a major element of the event, which in the past has included a house band for the main venue, theater, culinary experiences,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://entourageeventsgroup.com/dnc2020/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zillihospitalitygroup.com/dnc-2020/|title=Democratic National Convention 2020 Catering|website=www.zillihospitalitygroup.com|access-date=August 8, 2020|archive-date=August 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819173606/https://www.zillihospitalitygroup.com/dnc-2020/|url-status=live}}</ref> and hundreds of motivational speakers. Indeed, the convention experience for attendees at the venue itself is extremely different from that for the viewer at home. With live coverage of the event limited, outside of the three major news networks and C-SPAN, to the keynote and acceptance speeches, the challenge to the DNC is how to boost ratings while increasing the nominee's [[Convention bounce|lead in opinion polls.]] With [[social distancing]] still paramount to ensure the safety of the tens of thousands of people who were due to attend the main venue in Milwaukee, will not be able to do so, alternative methods are planned for a series of satellite venues across the country.<ref name="conventionacross">{{cite web |title=Anchored in Milwaukee, 2020 Democratic National Convention will be a "Convention Across America" |url=https://www.demconvention.com/press-releases/anchored-in-milwaukee-2020-democratic-national-convention-will-be-a-convention-across-america/ |website=2020 Democratic National Convention |publisher=2020 Democratic National Convention Committee |accessdate=June 30, 2020 |date=June 24, 2020 |archive-date=June 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627132550/https://www.demconvention.com/press-releases/anchored-in-milwaukee-2020-democratic-national-convention-will-be-a-convention-across-america/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

The official theme of the convention will be "Uniting America".<ref name="unitingamerica"/>

The downsizing and coronavirus concerns also mean the convention will not see the festive [[Toy balloon|balloon]] drop often seen at such conventions following the presidential candidate's acceptance speech.<ref name=deadline1aug/> First appearing at the [[1932 Republican National Convention]], a balloon drop would later reappear at the [[1956 Republican National Convention]], and would become a staple of most major party conventions held since.<ref name="balloondrophistory">{{cite web |title=History of the convention balloon drop |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/political-conventions-balloon-drop-tradition-republican-democrats/ |website=www.cbsnews.com |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=August 3, 2020 |language=en |date=July 23, 2016 |archive-date=February 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210173851/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/political-conventions-balloon-drop-tradition-republican-democrats/ |url-status=live}}</ref> However, not all Democratic conventions have featured balloon drops. Most recently, both the [[2008 Democratic National Convention|2008]] and [[2012 Democratic National Convention|2012]] Democratic National Conventions did not see balloon drops, due to the fact that the final night of the 2008 edition was held outdoors in a stadium, and due to the fact that the final night of the 2012 edition had originally been scheduled to be held outdoors before being moved indoors. Other Democratic conventions that went without balloon drops included the [[1984 Democratic National Convention|1984]] and [[1988 Democratic National Convention|1988]] editions.<ref name="balloondrophistory"/>

===Satellite locations===
[[File:Chase Center on the Riverfront (40824456660).jpg|thumb|Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington, Delaware, was a satellite location.]]

When party officials concluded that the pandemic would make a traditional convention impossible, they decided to adopt a format that was dramatically different from past conventions. The event has been officially dubbed a "Convention Across America".<ref name="conventionacross"/><ref name="unitingamerica"/>

While the convention will be anchored in Milwaukee, the events will be held in a dozen or so satellite sites spread out across the nation. From there, the delegations will transmit their votes on the floor of the Wisconsin Center, where a representative will announce the votes to relevant officials at the chair in the main venue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://demlist.com/demdaily-democrats-announce-virtual-convention/ |title=DemDaily: Democrats Announce Virtual Convention! |date=June 25, 2020 |access-date=June 26, 2020 |archive-date=June 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200629100910/https://demlist.com/demdaily-democrats-announce-virtual-convention/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Nominating and balloting==
===Pre-convention delegate count===
The table below reflects the presumed delegate count as per the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2020 Democratic primaries]].

{{As of|July 2020}}, the following overall number of pledged delegates is subject to change, as possible penalty/bonus delegates (awarded for each state scheduled election date and potential regional clustering) may be altered.<ref name="delegatecount">{{cite web |url=https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/D |title=Democratic Convention 2020 |publisher=thegreenpapers.com |accessdate=February 25, 2020 |archive-date=March 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306235014/https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/D |url-status=live}}</ref>

The 2020 Democratic Party rules state that, unless a candidate has secured a majority of delegates using only pledged delegates, the superdelegates will have no voting rights on the first ballot.<ref name=herndon/><ref name=levy1/><ref name=levy2/>

Candidates who have suspended their campaigns without having received any pledged or superdelegate endorsements, as well as those who've suspended their campaigns and subsequently lost their endorsements to other candidates, are not included in the table below.

The table below reflects the presumed pledged delegate count following the [[2020 Democratic primaries]]. In addition to these, there will also be 771 superdelegate votes (including the eight half-votes belonging to [[Democrats Abroad]] superdelegates), making for 4,750 combined delegate votes.<ref name="delegatecount"/><ref name=stevens1/>

In an email, DNC secretary Jason Rae wrote to delegates outlining the process for that year's convention, noting that the planning committee "concluded that state delegations should not plan to travel to Milwaukee and official convention business will be conducted remotely."

Delegates vote remotely using a system the planning committee crafted that allows them to cast their ballots via email, with unique identifiers for security. The DNC had plans to certify each delegate.

The party said delegates would be able to fill out the forms electronically, with no need for a printer or physical copy, according to the letter. The ballot, which includes questions about platform planks and the party's nominees, will be emailed to their state's committee. Once a state party had all the ballots from their delegation, the state delegation's chair would "submit a tally sheet to the Secretary's Office that formally records the number of votes cast on each item of convention business," The votes would be counted all at once on August 15, not as they come in.

Voting began August 3 and ended August 15, when the state delegation chairs were asked to submit their final tallies to the DNC secretary. That meant that the party knew the tally of votes for its nominee before the convention formally began.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/506888-dnc-outlines-remote-work-process-for-delegates-to-milwaukee-convention|title=DNC outlines remote voting process for Milwaukee convention|first=Kaelan|last=Deese|date=July 11, 2020|website=TheHill|access-date=July 13, 2020|archive-date=August 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819173607/https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/506888-dnc-outlines-remote-work-process-for-delegates-to-milwaukee-convention|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/10/politics/dnc-remote-voting/index.html|title=Democrats reveal remote voting rules for convention amid pandemic|author=Dan Merica|website=CNN|access-date=July 13, 2020|archive-date=July 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200713152955/https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/10/politics/dnc-remote-voting/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Vice presidential nomination====
The Rules Committee report which was passed by the convention addressed, among other things, the fiascos that occurred during the [[1972 Democratic National Convention#Running mate|1972]] and [[1980 Democratic National Convention#Vice President|1980]] conventions as regards selection of the vice-presidential nominee.

Rule C.7. of the Rules of Procedure states:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.demconvention.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FINAL-Permanent-Convention-Rules-of-Procedure-7.30.20.pdf |title=PERMANENT Procedural Rules of the 2020 Democratic National Convention |pages=4–5 |date=July 30, 2020 |publisher=2020 Democratic National Convention}}</ref>
{{Quote frame|7. Nomination for the Democratic Candidate for Vice President: The Democratic candidate(s) for Vice President shall be nominated by the Presidential candidate who has obtained a number of pledged delegates equal to a majority of all pledged and automatic delegates to the Convention. If there is only one nominee for Vice President, the Chair is authorized to declare the nominated individual the Democratic Candidate for Vice President.}}

In accordance with this provision, Biden submitted Harris' name to the chairman, [[Bennie Thompson]], and after Thompson's public reading of the rule, she was declared nominated.

==Schedule==
Each night of the convention was planned to last two hours. In addition to the convention's overall official theme of "Uniting America", each night had an official sub-theme of its own.<ref name="unitingamerica"/>

For four years, people have said to me, 'I didn't realize how dangerous (Trump) was,' 'I wish I could go back and do it over,' 'I should have voted.' This can't be another woulda-coulda-shoulda election. If you're voting by mail, request your ballot now, and send it back as soon as you can. If you vote in person, do it early. Bring a friend and wear a mask. Become a poll worker...Remember, Joe and Kamala can win 3 million more votes and still lose. Take it from me. We need numbers so overwhelming Trump can't sneak or steal his way to victory.

==Impact==
The convention was regarded to have been largely successful.<ref name="politcobounce1">{{cite web |last=Shepard |first=Steven |title=Why Joe Biden's bounce might not be coming |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/21/joe-biden-convention-bounce-400083 |website=POLITICO |accessdate=9 September 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Reilly |first1=Briana |title=DNC recap: Programming, ratings, convention bounce and another chance for Milwaukee in 2024? |url=https://madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/dnc-recap-programming-ratings-convention-bounce-and-another-chance-for-milwaukee-in-2024/article_a47f9033-d27d-54ea-ae5c-07d576e12279.html |website=madison.com |publisher=The Capital Times |accessdate=14 September 2020 |language=en |date=22 August 2020}}</ref>

===Lack of a convention bounce===
The first polls conducted after the Democratic National Convention showed no convention bounce for Biden.<ref name="politcobounce1" /><ref name="newsweekbounce">{{cite web |last=McLean |first=Scott |title=Why Trump, like Biden, should not expect a post-convention polling bounce {{!}} Opinion |url=https://www.newsweek.com/why-trump-like-biden-should-not-expect-post-convention-polling-bounce-opinion-1527551 |website=Newsweek |accessdate=9 September 2020 |language=en |date=25 August 2020}}</ref> Later polling, conducted after the Republican National Convention concluded the following week, indicated that there had been virtually no [[convention bounce]] for either party coming out of August conventions held in back-to-back weeks.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Herndon |first1=Astead W. |last2=Karni |first2=Annie |title=The Latest Polls, the Great Non-Tightening: This Week in the 2020 Race |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/05/us/politics/trump-biden-polls-election.html?fbclid=IwAR3mw4ed1cgD4ryGa7FGXIXAtm7AmPag3zihluwU6k0yOFG-OxIPn0yiS-k |website=The New York Times |accessdate=6 September 2020 |date=5 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Mohyeldin |first=Ayman |title=New polls show race virtually unchanged after conventions |url=https://www.msnbc.com/ayman-mohyeldin/watch/new-polls-show-race-virtually-unchanged-after-conventions-91037253526?fbclid=IwAR3mw4ed1cgD4ryGa7FGXIXAtm7AmPag3zihluwU6k0yOFG-OxIPn0yiS-k |website=MSNBC.com |accessdate=6 September 2020 |language=en |date=2 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Druke |first=Galen |title=A FiveThirtyEight Forecast Update: Was There A Convention Bounce? |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/a-fivethirtyeight-forecast-update-was-there-a-convention-bounce/ |website=FiveThirtyEight |accessdate=6 September 2020 |date=2 September 2020}}</ref>

Ahead of, and during, the conventions, various outlets had speculated that significant convention bounces were unlikely for either party.<ref name="bounceCNN">{{cite web |last=Enten |first=Harry |title=Large convention bounces are unlikely In 2020 |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/15/politics/conventions-bounce-analysis/index.html |website=CNN |accessdate=9 September 2020 |date=15 August 2020}}</ref><ref name="washpobidenbounce">{{cite web |last=Tumulty |first=Karen |title=Opinion {{!}} Don't be surprised if Biden doesn't get a convention bounce in the polls. That's not the point. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-be-surprised-if-biden-doesnt-get-a-convention-bounce-in-the-polls-thats-not-the-point/2020/08/20/cd36b9d0-e306-11ea-8dd2-d07812bf00f7_story.html |website=Washington Post |accessdate=9 September 2020 |date=18 August 2020}}</ref><ref name="newsweekbounce" /><ref name="LATIMES">{{cite web |last=Lauter |first=David |title=Essential Politics: How Trump could win |url=https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2020-08-28/how-trump-could-win-essential-politics |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=9 September 2020 |date=28 August 2020}}</ref> This was due to several cited factors. One was that it had been observed that convention bounces had been more minuscule in recent elections. Per some calculations, convention bounces had averaged just 2 points since 2004, compared to just under 7 points between 1968 and 2000.<ref name="bounceCNN" /> Per other calculations, average bounces since 1996 averaged 3.6 points, while bounces between 1962 and 1992 averaged 6.3 points.<ref name="newsweekbounce" /> Another factor cited for why it was seen as unlikely for either party to generate a significant convention bounce in 2020 was that polls in the 2020 race had, in the months prior to the convention, shown a remarkably steady race, with Biden consistently holding an approximately 6-point er exceeding an average lead of 10 points and never slipping below a lead of 4 points. It has been shown that more stable races tend to see smaller convention bounces.<ref name="bounceCNN" /><ref name="LATIMES" /> Another was that the conventions, having been scaled-back due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were seen as less likely to generate as much attention as past conventions had, particularly due to the decrease in television viewership .<ref name="bounceCNN" /><ref name="washpobidenbounce" /> Another was that the electorate was already strongly opinionated on the candidates, with more voters holding a strong opinion on Trump than any incumbent since at least 1980, and more voters holding a strong opinion on Biden than any challenger to an incumbent since at least 1980.<ref name="bounceCNN" /> Races where voters hold strong opinions on the candidates tend to see smaller convention bounces.<ref name="bounceCNN" /> Strong partisanship among the electorate was another cited factor.<ref name="LATIMES" />

The Democrats were also seen as having factors which the Republican convention did not that might hamper its chances at a convention bump. One was the fact that the Republicans would hold their convention immediately following them.<ref name="politcobounce1" /> Additionally, the fact that Biden already had a large lead among independents heading into the convention, possibly made Biden particularly unlikely to experience a convention bounce, as some speculated that Biden may have already been near his likely ceiling of support.<ref name="newsweekbounce" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Pfeiffer |first=Dan |title=How to Judge the Democratic Convention |url=https://messagebox.substack.com/p/how-to-judge-the-democratic-convention |website=messagebox.substack.com |accessdate=9 September 2020 |date=18 August 2020}}</ref>

While his electoral poll numbers may not have received a bounce, some polling showed Biden to have received a boost in favorability ratings.<ref>{{cite web |last=Peters |first=Cameron |title=Poll: Biden's approval rating got a convention bounce.
