== History ==
===Formation and listing===

[[Bunge & Born]] was founded in 1818 by Johann Peter Gottlieb Bunge in [[Amsterdam]], it was relocated to [[Antwerp]] by Edouard Bunge in 1859. Edouard's brother; Ernest Bunge, took the Bunge name to [[Argentina]] in 1884, and in 1905 the business extended to [[Brazil]] and later on to the United States.  The company was converted into the [[Bermuda]]-registered [[Bunge International]] in 1994, retaining the Bunge y Born name only in Argentina. Bunge remained a privately held company of 180 shareholders (including the longtime controlling family interests) and divested itself in 1998 of almost all its retail foods interests in favor of a greater role in international [[agribusiness]] and commodity markets; by then the company's gross annual turnover had reached US$13 billion.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/economico/98-05-31/o-00401e.htm ''Clarín'': La retirada final del grupo Bunge & Born] {{in lang|es}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20090312080052/http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/economico/98-05-31/o-00401e.htm Archived copy]</ref> Bunge ultimately went [[public company|public]] on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 2001, becoming Bunge Limited.

In 1994, the Bermuda-registered Bunge International was created as the main company in which the families had shares. There were around 180 shareholders—the main families were Hirsch, Bunge, Born, Engels, and De La Tour. This replaced the older structure in which individual shareholders had stakes in all the different Bunge companies. Now only in Argentina does the Bunge y Born name still exist.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 2001, under the leadership of Alberto Weisser,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.barrons.com/articles/ubs-new-boss-new-mission-1474088725|title=UBS: New Boss, New Mission|newspaper=Barron's|last=Talati|first=Sonia|date=September 17, 2016}}</ref> Bunge was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Through their three businesses—[[agribusiness]], [[fertilizer]], and food products—they have established a leading global presence in the farm-to-consumer food chain. Bunge is the world's largest [[oilseed]] processor, the world's number one seller of bottled [[vegetable oil]] to consumers and the largest producer and supplier of fertilizers to farmers in [[South America]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Brazilian sourcing protests ===

In 2012, Bunge came under criticism from NGO [[Survival International]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8812|title=US food giant accused over biofuel 'tainted with Indian blood'|author=Survival International|work=survivalinternational.org}}</ref> for sourcing its sugarcane from the ancestral land of the [[Guaraní people]] in [[Brazil]]. It has been reported by the tribe that crop production has brought pesticides and machinery that has damaged their health, as well as restricting them to a small area that has prevented them from hunting and practicing their traditions.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Also, in January 2003, opposition from the tribe had led to the killing of their chief Marcus Vernon by ranchers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/deadly-ethanol-brazils-sugarcane-farms-take-toll-indigenous-people-912116|title=Deadly Ethanol: Brazil’s Sugarcane Farms Take Toll On Indigenous People|author=Ryan Villarreal|date=8 December 2012|work=International Business Times}}</ref> In 2012, survivors were requesting Bunge follows the example of the company [[Raízen]], which agreed to stop the sourcing of sugarcane from the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8399|title=Shell scraps controversial biofuels plan after Brazilian Indian protest|author=Survival International|work=survivalinternational.org}}</ref>

==Environmental record==
{{see also|Gran Chaco#Conservation issues}}
In 2006, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] filed charges against Bunge company regarding pollution emissions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/settlements/06585/bunge-pollution.html|title=Bunge North America Inc.|work=lawyersandsettlements.com}}</ref> This involved twelve soybean processing plants and corn mills in eight states throughout the US. The lawsuit claimed Bunge violated the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] by constructing major modifications that increased emissions. Bunge was required to implement engineering changes and [[pollution control]] projects, estimated to cost $12 million, to reduce emissions at the facilities by 2,200 tons a year. The settlement also called for Bunge to pay a cash penalty of $625,000 and to spend $1.25 million to fund community-based environmental projects selected by and to be supervised by the impacted states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/8b770facf5edf6f185257359003fb69e/ccddd2cbb05de0118525721300631247!OpenDocument|title=10/26/2006: $13.9 Million Clean Air Act Settlement with Multinational Soybean and Corn Processor Secures Major Pollution Reductions in Eight States - Settlement Expected to Eliminate More than 2,200 Tons of Harmful Emissions Annually|work=epa.gov}}</ref>  The state of Kansas will receive $22,000 of the $625,000 civil penalty, this being issued by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4179/is_20061031/ai_n16814340 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927165116/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4179/is_20061031/ai_n16814340 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-09-27 |title=FindArticles.com - CBSi }}</ref>

== Tax dodging ==
A noteworthy case of [[transfer mispricing]] came to light in 2011 in Argentina involving the world’s four largest grain traders: [[Archer Daniels Midland|ADM]], Bunge, [[Cargill]] and [[Louis Dreyfus Company]]. Argentina’s revenue and customs service began an investigation into the four companies when prices for agricultural commodities spiked in 2008 and yet very little profit for the four companies had been reported to the office. As a result of the investigation, it was alleged that the companies had submitted false declarations of sales and routed profits through tax havens or through their headquarters. In some cases, they were said to have used phantom firms to buy grain and had inflated costs in Argentina in order to reduce the recorded profits earned in the country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jun/01/argentina-accuses-grain-traders-tax-evasion|title=Argentina accuses world's largest grain traders of huge tax evasion|last=Lawrence|first=Felicity|date=2011-06-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-08-01|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> According to the country’s revenue and customs service, the outstanding taxes amounted to almost USD 1 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-03-25/grain-exporters-owe-argentina-951-million-in-taxes|title=Grain Exporters Owe Argentina 951 Million in Taxes|last=Bloomberg|date=2013-03-25|access-date=1 August 2019}}</ref> The companies involved have denied the allegations. To date, the Argentinian tax authorities have not replied to the [[Public Eye (organization)|Swiss NGO Public Eye]]’s request regarding the current state of the case.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.publiceye.ch/fileadmin/doc/Agrarrohstoffe/2019_PublicEye_Agricultural-Commodity-Traders-in-Switzerland_Report.pdf|title=Agricultural Commodity Traders in Switzerland|last=Public Eye|date=June 2019|access-date=1 August 2019}}</ref> In its 2018 annual report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Bunge mentioned provisions which suggest that the case is still ongoing: “[A]s of December 31, 2018, Bunge’s Argentine subsidiary had received income tax assessments relating to 2006 through 2009 of approximately 1,276 million Argentine pesos (approximately $34 million), plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount of approximately 4,246 million Argentine pesos (approximately $113 million<sup>]</sup>).”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://last10k.com/sec-filings/bg|title=Bunge Ltd (BG) 10K Annual Reports & 10Q SEC Filings|website=Last10K|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>
