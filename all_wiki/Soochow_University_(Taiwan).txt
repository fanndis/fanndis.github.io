==History==
The original [[Soochow University (1900–1952)|Soochow University]] was founded by [[Methodist]]s in [[Suzhou]], [[Jiangsu]], [[Qing dynasty]] in 1900 as a merger of three institutions: the Buffington Institute and the Kung Hang School in the city of Soochow (now spelled Suzhou), in Jiangsu Province, and the Anglo-Chinese College in Shanghai.

After the [[Chinese Civil War]], members of the Soochow Alumni Association who fled to Taiwan established a new institution there in 1951. A law school was opened in 1954, and a full university was certified in 1971.<ref>Soochow University (2010). [http://www.scu.edu.tw/eng/module_tag1_option_1_eng.html History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104212844/http://www.scu.edu.tw/eng/module_tag1_option_1_eng.html |date=4 November 2013 }}. Retrieved 2 October 2010.</ref>  As a new Soochow University was later founded on the original site in 1982, there would be a Soochow University in Taiwan and a Soochow University in Jiangsu.

The campus is home to the tomb of the prominent Chinese politician and diplomat [[Wang Ch'unghui]], who fled to Taiwan after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.

In 2014, the [[Japan–Taiwan Exchange Association]] listed Soochow University as one of the seven well-known Taiwanese universities.<ref>交流, No.879, p.6. A total of 5 public universities and 2 private universities were selected: [[National Taiwan University|NTU]], [[National Cheng Kung University|NCKU]], [[National Tsing Hua University|NTHU]], [[National Chiao Tung University|NCTU]], [[National Chengchi University|NCCU]], [[Fu Jen Catholic University|Fu Jen Catholic]] and Soochow University.</ref>

== Publications ==
In 1981, the first joint-issued class-made magazine, completely founded by students, called ''Xu Ai'', appeared in Soochow University.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} Students voiced political opinions as to temporal society, but the magazine was quickly banned by the strong commend of the college.

However, the next year, the political students published another critical magazine, ''Monthly Political Magazine of Soochow University''. It was banned, a result from publishing an advertisement of ''Shen Geng'', which was a magazine of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party]] control.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}}

On 9 September 1982, the Academic Conference of Political Department<ref>{{Cite web|title = 東吳大學政治系-學系介紹|url = http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=Profile|website = www2.scu.edu.tw|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}</ref> organized an audit for second year students about [[Taipei City Council]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} But the lead teacher Huang Erxuan{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} was charged by leading a group of students to the council to listen the interpolation produced by the outside party senator. He was fired the next year.

==Excellent Long-Established University Consortium of Taiwan==

The twelve union universities were all founded over half a century with each of their own strengths covering professional fields of science and technology, commerce, agronomy, medicine, media, law, education, art and design, etc.….

==Sports==
Sports play an important role in campus life. The downtown campus has tennis and basketball courts. The main campus has indoor and outdoor basketball courts, tennis courts, a race track, a mini rock climbing wall, and a field that is used for softball and soccer. Each year the university holds two major student athletic events.

Much of the sports facilities on the main campus are on land owned by the Taipei city government rather than by the university. The city government has considered reclaiming the land to build an expressway but has decided to back off with this project.

==Clubs==
The university has 183 student clubs or societies, such as Association for Diplomacy Research (SCU A.D.R.).

==Traditions==
[[File:2007SCUltraMarathon Day1 Morning-21.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Ultramarathon]]
*'''[[24-hour run|24-hour International Ultramarathon]]''': Runners from several countries, students, faculty, and celebrities such as [[Ryoichi Sekiya]] and [[Mami Kudo]] participate in this annual event. Only very few of the contestants venture running for the entire duration of the marathon. Portable toilets are set up near the race track with one or two toilets reserved for certain internationally renowned runners. Some spectators set up tents near the track and camp the entire night watching the marathon.
*'''Campus Christmas Carol''': Students from the music department visit the faculty residential apartment complexes sing Christmas carols on Christmas Eve. Having people singing carols in the neighborhood is a rare sight in Taiwan since Christians make up a small minority of the population.
