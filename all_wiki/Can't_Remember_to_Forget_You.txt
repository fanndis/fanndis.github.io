"'''Can't Remember to Forget You'''" is a song recorded by Colombian singer-songwriter [[Shakira]] from her fourth English and overall tenth studio album, ''[[Shakira (album)|Shakira]]'', featuring Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]]. Shakira began planning to make new music in 2011; work continued into 2012, at which time she left her previous label Epic Records and joined [[RCA Records]]. The song was released as the lead single of the album on 13 January 2014 through RCA Records and Sony Latin Iberia. A solo Spanish-language version of the song, entitled "'''Nunca Me Acuerdo de Olvidarte'''", was released on 24 January 2014.

The song was co-written by Shakira, Rihanna, [[John Hill (record producer)|John Hill]], [[Kid Harpoon|Tom "Kid Harpoon" Hull]], Daniel Alexander, and [[Erik Hassle]], while production was handled by Shakira, Hill, and Hull.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcarecords.com/news/shakira-unveils-brand-new-single-%E2%80%9Ccan%E2%80%99t-remember-forget-you%E2%80%9D-featuring-rihanna |title=Shakira Unveils Brand New Single "Can'T Remember To Forget You" Featuring Rihanna &#124; The Official Rca Records Site |publisher=Rcarecords.com |date=13 January 2014 |accessdate=1 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116085541/http://www.rcarecords.com/news/shakira-unveils-brand-new-single-%E2%80%9Ccan%E2%80%99t-remember-forget-you%E2%80%9D-featuring-rihanna |archive-date=16 January 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> "Can't Remember to Forget You" is an [[uptempo]] track that fuses reggae, rock and new wave pop.<ref name="theguardian1"/> Lyrically the song revolves around forgetting someone who is bad even though you love the person.
Upon its release, "Can't Remember to Forget You" was met with mixed reviews from critics; while critics praised the [[ska]] influences, they felt that the song overall was not memorable. Other critics noted similarities between the song and the music of [[The Police]] and [[Bruno Mars]].

Commercially, the single fared well, peaking at eleven in the United Kingdom; the song also peaked within the top ten of Spain, France, Germany and Switzerland. In the US the song debuted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at twenty-eight and later went on to peak at fifteen on the chart, becoming Shakira's highest-debuting track in the region. The music video, which was shot in a Los Angeles mansion, was directed by [[Joseph Kahn]] and was premiered and uploaded to [[YouTube]] on 30 January 2014. The accompanying video featured both Shakira and Rihanna in revealing outfits and a "naked embrace". The song was performed live for the first time on [[iHeartRadio]].
