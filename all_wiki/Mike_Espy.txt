==Corruption trial and acquittal==
===Espy trial===
On August 27, 1997, Espy was indicted on charges of receiving improper gifts, including sports tickets, lodging, and airfare. Espy refused to [[plea bargain]] and on December 2, 1998, he was [[Acquittal|acquitted]] of all 30 criminal charges in the trial. [[Independent Counsel]] [[Donald Smaltz]] presented more than 70 witnesses during the trial and spent more than $20&nbsp;million preparing and trying the case.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Archived copy |url=http://www.oic.gov/SMALTZ/FnlRpt.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030602172920/http://www.oic.gov/SMALTZ/FnlRpt.htm |archive-date=June 2, 2003 |access-date=May 3, 2003}}</ref>

During testimony before the jury, the prosecution's star witness told Smaltz: "God knows, if I had $30&nbsp;million, I could find dirt on you, sir."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Was this a bad idea? - December 14, 1998 |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/time/1998/12/07/independant.council.html |website=www.cnn.com}}</ref> During the trial, Smaltz protested that the defense was injecting race into the trial in what he saw as an appeal to a mostly black jury.

The defense rested without calling any witnesses, arguing simply that the prosecution had not proved its case. The jury deliberated less than 10 hours before finding Espy not guilty on all charges. One of the jurors said, "This was the weakest, most bogus thing I ever saw. I can't believe Mr. Smaltz ever brought this to trial." At least four other jurors echoed this view, though less pointedly.<ref name="washingtonpost.com">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/counsels/stories/espy120498.htm Espy Acquitted in Gifts Case]. Washingtonpost.com (December 5, 1998). Retrieved on September 14, 2011.</ref> Barbara Bisoni, the only white juror, said Smaltz's case "had holes" and that race never entered into the deliberations.<ref name="washingtonpost.com" />

===Related cases===
In 1996, [[Sun-Diamond Growers]] was fined $1.5&nbsp;million for giving Espy $6,000 in gifts; in March 1998 it won a reversal at the Court of Appeals level.<ref name="Sun Diamond">[https://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/21/business/fi-31106 Court Sets Aside Fine Against Sun-Diamond] , ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 21, 1998</ref> Independent Counsel Smaltz appealed that ruling to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals, finding that the gratuities statute requires a link between a gift and an official act. Unable to make such a link, Smaltz dismissed the gratuities charge against Sun-Diamond. The court's unanimous April 1999 opinion, by Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], stated that the prosecutor's interpretation of the law was so broad that even a high school principal could be in legal trouble for giving a souvenir baseball cap to a visiting Secretary of Education.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/04/27/scotus.espy/ Supreme Court rules Sun Diamond Growers did not violate federal law in Espy case - April 27, 1999]. Cnn.com (April 27, 1999). Retrieved on September 14, 2011.</ref> The Sun-Diamond decision played a pivotal role in Espy's later acquittal because Smaltz was unable to link gifts he received to any official act.

In a separate case during the same investigation, Espy's Chief of Staff, Ronald Blackley, was convicted in late 1997 on three counts of making false statements<ref>{{Cite news |last=Stout |first=David |date=June 6, 1999 |title=Prosecution That Spared Espy Leaves a Top Aide in Ruins |language=en |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/06/us/prosecution-that-spared-espy-leaves-a-top-aide-in-ruins.html |access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref> and sentenced to 27 months in prison.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Donald Smaltz - Ron Blackley - Secrets Of An Independent Counsel - FRONTLINE - PBS |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/counsel/smaltz/blackley.html |website=www.pbs.org}}</ref>

Controversy also arose in 1994 from a White House discovery that a foundation run by [[Tyson Foods]] had given Espy's then girlfriend, Patricia Dempsey, a $1,200 scholarship.<ref name=wapo1994 /> Espy and his lawyer admitted that they deceived the White House,<ref name=wapo1994 /> which at first accepted Espy's false claim that he was unaware of the scholarship before it was given to Dempsey.<ref name=wapo1994 /> Administration officials said that the discovery of this scholarship was what forced Espy to resign as Secretary of Agriculture.<ref name=wapo1994 /> In December 1997, [[Tyson Foods]] pleaded guilty to felony charges of giving Espy gifts.<ref name="johnson">M.
