The '''University of Arkansas School of Law''' is the [[law school]] of the [[University of Arkansas]] in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]], a [[State university system|state university]]. It has around 445 students enrolled in its [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) and [[Master of Law]] (LL.M) programs and is home to the nation's first LL.M in agricultural and food law program. The School of Law is one of two law schools in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Arkansas]]; the other is the [[William H. Bowen School of Law]] ([[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]]).

According to the University of Arkansas School of Law's 2013 ABA-required disclosures, 68% of the Class of 2013 had obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation.<ref name="Employment Statistics">{{cite web|url=http://law.uark.edu/documents/2012/06/EmploymentSummary-2013.pdf |title=Employment Statistics}}</ref>

==History==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Uarksixpioneers.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Six Pioneers historical marker]] -->
The School of Law was founded in 1924. The founding [[Dean (education)|dean]] was Julian Waterman, a [[Dumas, Arkansas]] native and [[University of Chicago Law School]] graduate who led the school through its first 19 years, until his death in 1943.

The School met initially in the bottom floor of [[Old Main (University of Arkansas)|Old Main]], and was approved by the [[American Bar Association]] two years later, in 1926. In 1927, the first class, consisting of ten students, graduated.

Over the next several decades, as the law school grew in size, it moved to larger accommodations. The 1930s saw a move to the Chemistry Building just to the southeast of Old Main, and then into Waterman Hall, the first dedicated law school construction project, in the 1950s. The latter half of the 20th century saw additions added to Waterman Hall to form the Robert A. Leflar Law Center.

In 1947, the law school offered admission to [[L. Clifford Davis]], under conditions that would not allow him to be in any room at the same room as white students, including classrooms, restrooms, and the library. Davis chose to instead to take tuition money from the state to attend Howard University, in Washington, D.C.<ref name="ABL">{{cite web |last1=Kilpatrick |first1=Judith |title=Desegregating the University of Arkansas School of Law: L. Clifford Davis and the Six Pioneers |url=https://arkansasblacklawyers.uark.edu/articles/ahq68-2.pdf |website=Arkansas Black Lawyers |accessdate=17 December 2018}}</ref> On February 2, 1948, the University of Arkansas School of Law became the first [[Southern United States|Southern]] white university to accept an [[African-American]] student since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. [[Silas Herbert Hunt|Silas H. Hunt]], a [[World War II]] veteran who had been wounded in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] and following the conclusion of the war had completed an [[undergraduate degree]] in [[English studies|English]] at [[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff|Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical & Normal College]] applied to multiple law schools in 1947. He chose to seek entry at the Arkansas School of Law to challenge the system of [[racial segregation]] established in Arkansas at the time.<ref name="encyclopediaofarkansas.net">[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=1676 Encyclopedia of the Ozarks entry on Silas Hunt].</ref> Accompanied by his attorney, Howard Flowers, Hunt met with the dean of the law school, Robert A. Leflar, who reviewed Hunt's application. Leflar was impressed and accepted Hunt's application to the law school. For a semester, Hunt attended the law school until succumbing to illness, and dying in a veteran's hospital on April 22, 1949, in [[Springfield, Missouri]].<ref name="encyclopediaofarkansas.net"/>

Following Hunt's successful entry into the law school, five more African-American students applied and were accepted into the law school: George Williford Boyce Haley, who went on to become a [[United States Ambassador to The Gambia]]; Wiley Branton, who served as dean at the [[Howard University School of Law]]; Jackie L. Shropshire; Chris Mercer; and [[George Howard, Jr.]], who later became the first black [[United States district court]] judge in Arkansas.<ref>[http://www.uark.edu/admin/urelinfo/SilasHunt/history.html University of Arkansas site on African-American history at the school.]</ref> Collectively they are known as the "Six Pioneers." Silas H. Hunt Hall, located adjacent to the Robert A. Leflar Law Center, honors Silas Hunt, in addition, to a historical marker in front of the law school.

In 2007, a {{convert|64000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} addition to the Leflar Law Center was completed, expanding on the Young Law Library, as well as adding a coffee shop, four classrooms, a technologically equipped courtroom, and a formal entrance hall.

Leflar Law Center''' on the campus of the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, which is located in [[Washington County, Arkansas|Washington County]] in [[Northwest Arkansas]] at the edge of the rolling hills of the [[Ozarks]].

The law center is a square facility with four wings around a [[courtyard]]. It consists of approximately {{convert|64000|sqft|m2}}, a courtroom, classrooms, and the Young Law Library. In addition to legal library resources, the Young Law Library includes a coffeeshop, computer lab and lounge area,

==Legal Clinic==
The [[legal clinic]] of the law school has been in operation for more than thirty years, offering free legal services to charities, government agencies, and individuals unable to afford legal representation.  The goal of the Legal Clinic, which offers the services of student attorneys, is firstly to train competently students in specific areas of legal practice encountered in every day law practice; and secondly to provide an opportunity for students to refine basic lawyering skills, such as counseling, interviewing and persuasive legal writing.<ref>[http://law.uark.edu/legal_clinic/ U of Ark law page on Legal Clinic.]</ref>
