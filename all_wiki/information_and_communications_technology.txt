'''Information and communications technology''' ('''ICT''') is an extensional term for [[information technology]] (IT) that stresses the role of [[unified communications]]<ref name="ICT-D-00">{{cite web | url=http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/modern-network-architecture/cloud-network-architecture-and-ict/ | title=Cloud network architecture and ICT - Modern Network Architecture | author=Murray, James | publisher=[[TechTarget]] =ITKnowledgeExchange | date=2011-12-18 | accessdate=2013-08-18 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2017-09-20 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920133800/http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/modern-network-architecture/cloud-network-architecture-and-ict/ }}</ref> and the integration of [[telecommunications]] ([[telephone]] lines and wireless signals) and computers, as well as necessary [[enterprise software]], [[middleware]], storage and audiovisual systems, that enable users to access, store, transmit, and manipulate information.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://foldoc.org/Information+and+Communication+Technology | title=Information and Communication Technology from | encyclopedia=FOLDOC | date=2008-09-19 | url-status=dead | accessdate=2010-09-29 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917072505/http://foldoc.org/Information+and+Communication+Technology | archive-date=2013-09-17 }}</ref>

The term ''ICT'' is also used to refer to the [[convergence (telecommunications)|convergence]] of audiovisual and [[telephone network]]s with [[computer network]]s through a single cabling or link system. There are large economic incentives to merge the telephone network with the computer network system using a single unified system of cabling, signal distribution, and management. ICT is an umbrella term that includes any communication device, encompassing radio, television, cell phones, computer and network hardware, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and appliances with them such as video conferencing and distance learning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kondra|first=Imaniyal|year=2020|title=Use of IT in Higher Education|journal=UGC Care Journal|publisher=Studies in Indian Place Names|location=India|volume=40|pages=280}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The phrase "information and communication technologies" has been used by academic researchers since the 1980s.<ref>William Melody et al., ''Information and Communication Technologies: Social Sciences Research and Training: A Report by the ESRC Programme on Information and Communication Technologies'', {{ISBN|0-86226-179-1}}, 1986. Roger Silverstone et al., "Listening to a long conversation: an ethnographic approach to the study of information and communication technologies in the home", ''Cultural Studies'', 5(2), pages 204–227, 1991.</ref> The abbreviation "ICT" became popular after it was used in a report to the UK government by [[Dennis Stevenson, Baron Stevenson of Coddenham|Dennis Stevenson]] in 1997,<ref>The Independent ICT in Schools Commission, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070104225121/http://rubble.ultralab.anglia.ac.uk/stevenson/ICT.pdf ''Information and Communications Technology in UK Schools: An Independent Inquiry''], 1997. Impact noted in Jim Kelly, [http://specials.ft.com/lifeonthenet/FT3NXTH03DC.html What the Web is Doing for Schools] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711045405/http://specials.ft.com/lifeonthenet/FT3NXTH03DC.html |date=2011-07-11 }}, Financial Times, 2000.</ref> and then in the revised [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] for England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2000. However, in 2012, the [[Royal Society]] recommended that the use of the term "ICT" should be discontinued in British schools "as it has attracted too many negative connotations".<ref>Royal Society, [https://royalsociety.org/~/media/education/computing-in-schools/2012-01-12-computing-in-schools.pdf Shut down or restart? The way forward for computing in UK schools], 2012, page 18.</ref> From 2014 the National Curriculum has used the word ''[[computing]],'' which reflects the addition of [[computer programming]] into the curriculum.<ref>Department for Education, {{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-computing-programmes-of-study|title=National curriculum in England: computing programmes of study}}</ref>

Variations of the phrase have spread worldwide. The United Nations has created a "[[United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force]]" and an internal "Office of Information and Communications Technology".<ref>United Nations Office of Information and Communications Technology, [https://unite.un.org/content/about About]</ref>

==Monetisation==
The money spent on IT worldwide has been estimated as US$3.8 trillion <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idc.com/promo/global-ict-spending/overview|title=IDC - Global ICT Spending - 2018 - $3.8T|website=IDC: The premier global market intelligence company|access-date=2018-09-24}}</ref> in 2017 and has been growing at less than 5% per year since 2009. The estimate 2018 growth of the entire ICT is 5%. The biggest growth of 16% is expected in the area of new technologies ([[Internet of things|IoT]], [[Robotics]], [[Augmented reality|AR]]/[[Virtual reality|VR]], and [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idc.com/promo/global-ict-spending/forecast|title=IDC - Global ICT Spending - Forecast 2018 – 2022|website=IDC: The premier global market intelligence company|access-date=2018-09-24}}</ref>

The 2014 IT budget of the US federal government was nearly $82 billion.<ref>http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/egov_docs/2014_budget_priorities_20130410.pdf</ref> IT costs, as a percentage of corporate revenue, have grown 50% since 2002, putting a strain on IT budgets. When looking at current companies' IT budgets, 75% are recurrent costs, used to "keep the lights on" in the IT department, and 25% are the cost of new initiatives for technology development.<ref name="omtco1">{{cite web|title=IT Costs – The Costs, Growth And Financial Risk Of Software Assets|url=http://omtco.eu/references/sam/it-costs-the-costs-growth-and-financial-risk-of-software-assets/|publisher=OMT-CO Operations Management Technology Consulting GmbH|accessdate=26 June 2011

The average IT budget has the following breakdown:<ref name="omtco1"/>
* 31% personnel costs (internal)
* 29% software costs (external/purchasing category)
* 26% hardware costs (external/purchasing category)
* 14% costs of external service providers (external/services).

The estimate of money to be spent in 2022 is just over US$6 trillion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idc.com/promo/global-ict-spending/forecast|title=IDC - Global ICT Spending - Forecast 2018 – 2022|website=IDC: The premier global market intelligence company|access-date=2018-09-24}}</ref>

==In education==
[[File: Mobile software development laboratory in The Estonian Information Technology College.jpg|thumb|Today's society shows the ever-growing computer-centric lifestyle, which includes the rapid influx of computers in the modern classroom.]]The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation ([[UNESCO]]), a division of the United Nations, has made integrating ICT into education part of its efforts to ensure equity and access to education. The following, taken directly from a UNESCO publication on educational ICT, explains the organization's position on the initiative.<blockquote>Information and Communication Technology can contribute to universal access to education, equity in education, the delivery of quality learning and teaching, teachers' professional development and more efficient education management, governance, and administration. [[UNESCO]] takes a holistic and comprehensive approach to promote ICT in education. Access, inclusion, and quality are among the main challenges they can address. The Organization's Intersectoral Platform for ICT in education focuses on these issues through the joint work of three of its sectors: Communication & Information, Education and Science.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICT in Education|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/themes/icts/|website=Unesco|publisher=Unesco|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref></blockquote>

Despite the power of computers to enhance and reform teaching and learning practices, improper implementation is a widespread issue beyond the reach of increased funding and technological advances with little evidence that teachers and tutors are properly integrating ICT into everyday learning. Intrinsic barriers such as a belief in more traditional teaching practices and individual attitudes towards computers in education as well as the teachers own comfort with computers and their ability to use them all as result in varying effectiveness in the integration of ICT in the classroom.

There is some evidence that, to be effective in education, ICT must be fully integrated into the [[pedagogy]].

=== Mobile learning for refugees ===
{{main|Mobile learning for refugees}}

School environments play an important role in facilitating language learning. However, language and literacy barriers are obstacles preventing refugees from accessing and attending school, especially outside camp settings.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|last=UNESCO|url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261278|title=A Lifeline to learning: leveraging mobile technology to support education for refugees|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100262-5}}</ref>

Mobile-assisted language learning apps are key tools for language learning. Mobile solutions can provide support for refugees’ language and literacy challenges in three main areas: literacy development, foreign language learning and translations. Mobile technology is relevant because communicative practice is a key asset for refugees and immigrants as they immerse themselves in a new language and a new society. Well-designed mobile language learning activities connect refugees with mainstream cultures, helping them learn in authentic contexts.<ref name=":7" />

=== Developing countries ===

==== Africa ====
[[File:M-Learning Policy Forum.jpg|alt=A computer screen at the front of a room of policy makers shows the Mobile Learning Week logo|thumb|Representatives meet for a policy forum on M-Learning at UNESCO's Mobile Learning Week in March 2017]]
ICT has been employed as an educational enhancement in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] since the 1960s. Beginning with television and radio, it extended the reach of education from the classroom to the living room, and to geographical areas that had been beyond the reach of the traditional classroom. As technology evolved and became more widely used, efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa were also expanded. In the 1990s a massive effort to push computer hardware and software into schools was undertaken, with the goal of familiarizing both students and teachers with computers in the classroom. Since then, multiple projects have endeavored to continue the expansion of ICT's reach in the region, including the [[One Laptop per Child|One Laptop Per Child]] (OLPC) project, which by 2015 had distributed over 2.4 million laptops to nearly 2 million students and teachers.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002318/231867e.pdf|title=Digital services for education in Africa|last=Agence Française de Développement|date=February 2015|website=unesco.org|access-date=19 May 2018}}</ref>

The inclusion of ICT in the classroom, often referred to as [[M-learning|M-Learning]], has expanded the reach of educators and improved their ability to track student progress in Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, the mobile phone has been most important in this effort. Mobile phone use is widespread, and mobile networks cover a wider area than internet networks in the region. The devices are familiar to student, teacher, and parent, and allow increased communication and access to educational materials. In addition to benefits for students, M-learning also offers the opportunity for better teacher training, which leads to a more consistent curriculum across the educational service area. In 2011, UNESCO started a yearly symposium called Mobile Learning Week with the purpose of gathering stakeholders to discuss the M-learning initiative.<ref name=":2" />

Implementation is not without its challenges. While mobile phone and internet use are increasing much more rapidly in Sub-Saharan Africa than in other developing countries, the progress is still slow compared to the rest of the developed world, with smartphone penetration only expected to reach 20% by 2017.<ref name=":2" /> Additionally, there are gender, social, and geo-political barriers to educational access, and the severity of these barriers vary greatly by country. Overall, 29.6 million children in Sub-Saharan Africa were not in school in the year 2012, owing not just to the geographical divide, but also to political instability, the importance of social origins, social structure, and gender inequality. Once in school, students also face barriers to quality education, such as teacher competency, training and preparedness, access to educational materials, and lack of information management.<ref name=":2" />

Modern ICT
In modern society ICT is ever-present, with over three billion people having access to the Internet.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|title = ITU releases annual global ICT data and ICT Development Index country rankings|url = http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/press_releases/2014/68.aspx#.VeUVoKBViko|website = www.itu.int|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}</ref> With approximately 8 out of 10 Internet users owning a smartphone, information and data are increasing by leaps and bounds.<ref>{{cite web|title = Survey: 1 In 6 Internet Users Own A Smartwatch Or Fitness Tracker|url = http://arc.applause.com/2015/01/12/survey-1-6-people-smartwatch-fitness-tracker/|website = ARC|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}</ref> This rapid growth, especially in developing countries, has led ICT to become a keystone of everyday life, in which life without some facet of technology renders most of clerical, work and routine tasks dysfunctional. The most recent authoritative data, released in 2014, shows "that Internet use continues to grow steadily, at 6.6% globally in 2014 (3.3% in developed countries, 8.7% in the developing world); the number of Internet users in developing countries has doubled in five years (2009-2014), with two thirds of all people online now living in the developing world."<ref name="librarylearningspace.com"/>

However, hurdles are still large. "Of the 4.3 billion people not yet using the Internet, 90% live in developing countries. In the world's 42 Least Connected Countries (LCCs), which are home to 2.5 billion people, access to ICTs remains largely out of reach, particularly for these countries' large rural populations."<ref>{{cite web|title = ITU releases annual global ICT data and ICT Development Index country rankings|url = http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/press_releases/2014/68.aspx#.VeUcN6BVikp|website = www.itu.int|accessdate = 2015-09-01}}</ref> ICT has yet to penetrate the remote areas of some countries, with many developing countries dearth of any type of Internet. This also includes the availability of telephone lines, particularly the availability of cellular coverage, and other forms of electronic transmission of data. The latest "Measuring the Information Society Report" cautiously stated that the increase in the aforementioned cellular data coverage is ostensible, as "many users have multiple subscriptions, with global growth figures sometimes translating into little real improvement in the level of connectivity of those at the very bottom of the pyramid; an estimated 450 million people worldwide live in places which are still out of reach of mobile cellular service."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Favorably, the gap between the access to the Internet and mobile coverage has d<nowiki/>ecreased substantially in the last fifteen years, in which "2015 <nowiki>[was]</nowiki> the deadline for achievements of the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which global leaders agreed upon in the year 2000, and the new data show ICT progress and highlight remaining gaps."<ref name="itu.int"/> ICT continues to take on new form, with nanotechnology set to usher in a new wave of ICT electronics and gadgets. ICT newest editions into the modern electronic world include smart watches, such as the [[Apple Watch]], smart wristbands such as the [[Nike+ FuelBand]], and smart TVs such as [[Google TV (smart TV platform)|Google TV]]. With desktops soon becoming part of a bygone era, and laptops becoming the preferred method of computing, ICT continues to insinuate and alter itself in the ever-changing globe.

According to a study published in 2017, this is likely because “[a]ccess to ICTs exposes women to different ways of life and different notions about women’s role in society and the household, especially in culturally conservative regions where traditional gender expectations contrast observed alternatives."<ref>Cardoso LG, Sorenson SB.

==Models of access to ICT==
Scholar [[Mark Warschauer]] defines a “models of access” framework for analyzing ICT accessibility. In the second chapter of his book, ''Technology and Social Inclusion: Rethinking the Digital Divide'', he describes three models of access to ICTs: devices, conduits, and literacy.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|title=Technology and Social Inclusion|last=Warschauer|first=Mark|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2004|isbn=0-262-23224-3|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=[https://archive.org/details/technologysocial0000wars/page/39 39–49]|url=https://archive.org/details/technologysocial0000wars/page/39}}</ref> Devices and conduits are the most common descriptors for access to ICTs, but they are insufficient for meaningful access to ICTs without third model of access, literacy.<ref name=":3" /> Combined, these three models roughly incorporate all twelve of the criteria of “Real Access” to ICT use, conceptualized by a non-profit organization called Bridges.org in 2005:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pasdbp.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/bridgesorg_real_access_real_impact1.pdf|title=The Real Access / Real Impact framework for improving the way that ICT is used in development|date=26 December 2005}}</ref>

=== Devices ===
The most straightforward model of access for ICT in [[Mark Warschauer|Warschauer]]’s theory is devices.<ref name=":3" /> In this model, access is defined most simply as the ownership of a device such as a phone or computer.<ref name=":3" /> [[Mark Warschauer|Warschauer]] identifies many flaws with this model, including its inability to account for additional costs of ownership such as software, access to telecommunications, knowledge gaps surrounding computer use, and the role of government regulation in some countries.<ref name=":3" /> Therefore, Warschauer argues that considering only devices understates the magnitude of digital inequality. For example, the [[Pew Research Center]] notes that 96% of Americans own a smartphone,<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/mobile/|title=Mobile Fact Sheet|website=Pew Research Center}}</ref> although most scholars in this field would contend that comprehensive access to ICT in the United States is likely much lower than that. 

=== Conduits ===
A conduit requires a connection to a supply line, which for ICT could be a telephone line or Internet line. Accessing the supply requires investment in the proper infrastructure from a commercial company or local government and recurring payments from the user once the line is set up. For this reason, conduits usually divide people based on their geographic locations. As a [[Pew Research Center]] poll reports, rural Americans are 12% less likely to have broadband access than other Americans, thereby making them less likely to own the devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/31/digital-gap-between-rural-and-nonrural-america-persists/|title=Digital gap between rural and nonrural America persists|last=Perrin|first=Andrew|website=Pew Research Center}}</ref> Additionally, these costs can be prohibitive to lower-income families accessing ICTs. These difficulties have led to a shift toward mobile technology; fewer people are purchasing broadband connection and are instead relying on their smartphones for Internet access, which can be found for free at public places such as libraries.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewinternet.org/2019/06/13/mobile-technology-and-home-broadband-2019/|title=Mobile Technology and Home Broadband 2019|last=Anderson|first=Monica|date=13 June 2019|website=Pew Research Center}}</ref> Indeed, smartphones are on the rise, with 37% of Americans using smartphones as their primary medium for internet access<ref name=":6" /> and 96% of Americans owning a smartphone.<ref name=":5" />

=== Literacy ===
[[File:Youth and adults with ICT skills, 2017.svg|thumb|Youth and adults with ICT skills, 2017]]
In 1981, [[Sylvia Scribner]] and [[Michael Cole (psychologist)|Michael Cole]] studied a tribe in [[Liberia]], the [[Vai people]], that has its own local language. Since about half of those literate in Vai have never had formal schooling, [[Sylvia Scribner|Scribner]] and [[Michael Cole (psychologist)|Cole]] were able to test more than 1,000 subjects to measure the mental capabilities of literates over non-literates.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|title=The Psychology of Literacy|last=Scribner and Cole|first=Sylvia and Michael|year=1981|isbn=9780674433014}}</ref> This research, which they laid out in their book ''The Psychology of Literacy'',<ref name=":4" /> allowed them to study whether the literacy divide exists at the individual level. [[Mark Warschauer|Warschauer]] applied their literacy research to ICT literacy as part of his model of ICT access.

[[Sylvia Scribner|Scribner]] and [[Michael Cole (psychologist)|Cole]] found no generalizable cognitive benefits from Vai literacy; instead, individual differences on cognitive tasks were due to other factors, like schooling or living environment.<ref name=":4" /> The results suggested that there is “no single construct of literacy that divides people into two cognitive camps; [...] rather, there are gradations and types of literacies, with a range of benefits closely related to the specific functions of literacy practices.”<ref name=":3" /> Furthermore, literacy and social development are intertwined, and the literacy divide does not exist on the individual level.

[[Mark Warschauer|Warschauer]] draws on [[Sylvia Scribner|Scribner]] and [[Michael Cole (psychologist)|Cole]]’s research to argue that ICT literacy functions similarly to literacy acquisition, as they both require resources rather than a narrow cognitive skill. Conclusions about literacy serve as the basis for a theory of the digital divide and ICT access, as detailed below:<blockquote>There is not just one type of ICT access, but many types. The meaning and value of access varies in particular social contexts. Access exists in gradations rather than in a bipolar opposition. Computer and Internet use brings no automatic benefit outside of its particular functions. ICT use is a social practice, involving access to physical artifacts, content, skills, and social support. And acquisition of ICT access is a matter not only of education but also of power.<ref name=":3" /></blockquote>Therefore, [[Mark Warschauer|Warschauer]] concludes that access to ICT cannot rest on devices or conduits alone; it must also engage physical, digital, human, and social resources.<ref name=":3" /> Each of these categories of resources have iterative relations with ICT use. If ICT is used well, it can promote these resources, but if it is used poorly, it can contribute to a cycle of underdevelopment and exclusion.<ref name=":4" />
