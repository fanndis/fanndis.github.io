Development of Tumblr began in 2006 during a two-week gap between contracts at [[David Karp]]'s software consulting company, Davidville (housed at Karp's former internship with producer-incubator [[Fred Seibert]]'s [[Frederator Studios]], which was located a block from Tumblr's current headquarters).<ref>{{cite AV media |last1 = Karp |first1 = David |last2 = Alexandria |first2 = Julie |date = May 27, 2008 |title = David Karp and Tumblr |type = Video |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DK4pLXWkgMw |access-date = February 24, 2013 |time = 1:30 |publisher = [[Wallstrip]]|quote = Sometime in 2006, we had a couple of weeks between contracts and said 'Let's see what we can do, let's see if we can build this thing', and we threw together the first working version of Tumblr. }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2013/01/02/tumblr-david-karps-800-million-art-project/2/ |title="Tumblr: David Karp's $800 Million Art Project" Forbes, January 2, 2013 |magazine=Forbes.com |date=April 18, 2012 |access-date=April 17, 2013}}</ref> Karp had been interested in [[microblogging|tumblelogs]] (short-form blogs, hence the name Tumblr<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rewindandcapture.com/why-is-tumblr-called-tumblr/|title=Why Is Tumblr Called Tumblr? &#124; Rewind & Capture|first=Lauren|last=Cosgrove}}</ref>) for some time and was waiting for one of the established blogging platforms to introduce their own tumblelogging platform.

Karp announced in November 2017 that he would be leaving Tumblr by the end of the year. Jeff D'Onofrio, Tumblr's President and COO, took over leading the company.<ref>{{cite web |first = Ingrid |last = Lunden | url = https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/27/david-karp-is-leaving-tumblr-by-the-end-of-the-year/ | title = David Karp is leaving Tumblr | date = November 28, 2017 | accessdate = November 28, 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171128024050/https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/27/david-karp-is-leaving-tumblr-by-the-end-of-the-year/ |archive-date = November 28, 2017 |url-status = live |df = mdy-all}}</ref>

The site, along with the rest of the Oath division (renamed Verizon Media Group in 2019), continued to struggle under Verizon. In March 2019, [[SimilarWeb]] estimated Tumblr had lost 30% of its user traffic since December 2018, when the site had introduced a [[#Adult content|stricter content policy]] with heavier restrictions on adult content (which had been a notable draw to the service).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266013/tumblr-porn-ban-lost-users-down-traffic|title=After the porn ban, Tumblr users have ditched the platform as promised|last=Liao|first=Shannon|date=2019-03-14|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> In May 2019, it was reported that Verizon was considering selling the site due to its continued struggles since the purchase (as it had done with another Yahoo property, [[Flickr]], via its sale to [[SmugMug]]). Following this news, [[Pornhub]]'s vice president publicly expressed interest in purchasing Tumblr, with a promise to reinstate the previous adult content policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18527177/verizon-seeking-tumblr-sale-rumor-blogging|title=Verizon is looking to sell Tumblr after squandering its potential|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=2019-05-02|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/05/pornhub-wants-to-buy-tumblr-and-restore-site-to-former-porn-filled-glory/|title=Pornhub wants to buy Tumblr and restore site to former porn-filled glory|last=Brodkin|first=Jon|date=2019-05-03|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref>

On August 12, 2019, Verizon Media announced that it would sell Tumblr to [[Automattic]]—operator of blog service [[WordPress.com]] and corporate backer of the [[WordPress|open source blog software of the same name]]—for an undisclosed amount. [[Axios (website)|Axios]] reported that the sale price was less than $3 million, a significant decrease over Yahoo's original purchase price. Automattic CEO [[Matt Mullenweg]] stated that the site will operate as a complementary service to WordPress.com, and that there were no plans to reverse the content policy decisions made during Verizon ownership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802639/tumblr-verizon-sold-wordpress-blogging-yahoo-adult-content|title=Verizon is selling Tumblr to WordPress' owner|last=Alexander|first=Julia|date=2019-08-12|website=The Verge|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref>

==Features==
===Blog management===
* '''Dashboard''': The dashboard is the primary tool for the typical Tumblr user. It is a live feed of recent posts from blogs that they follow.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/221565/total-cumulative-number-of-tumblr-posts/ | title=Cumulative total of Tumblr posts between May 2011 and April 2013 (in billions) | publisher=Statista | accessdate=May 21, 2013}}</ref> Through the dashboard, users are able to comment, reblog, and like posts from other blogs that appear on their dashboard. The dashboard allows the user to upload text posts, images, videos, quotes, or links to their blog with a click of a button displayed at the top of the dashboard. Users are also able to connect their blogs to their Twitter and Facebook accounts; so whenever they make a post, it will also be sent as a tweet and a status update.<ref name="Tumblr Help: Posts">{{cite web|title=Tumblr Help: Posts|url=http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/advanced_post_options|publisher=Tumblr.com|accessdate=January 27, 2014}}</ref>
* '''Queue''': Users are able to set up a schedule to delay posts that they make. They can spread their posts over several hours or even days.<ref name="Tumblr Help: Posts"/>
* '''Tags''': Users can help their audience find posts about certain topics by adding tags. If someone were to upload a picture to their blog and wanted their viewers to find pictures, they would add the tag #picture, and their viewers could use that word to search for posts with the tag #picture.
* '''HTML editing''': Tumblr allows users to edit their blog's theme HTML coding to control the appearance of their blog. Users are also able to use a custom domain name for their blog.

===Mobile===
With Tumblr's 2009 acquisition of Tumblerette, an [[iOS]] application created by Jeff Rock and Garrett Ross, the service launched its official [[iPhone]] app.<ref name=Mashable>{{cite web|last=Van Grove|first=Jennifer|title=Tumblr Rebrands Tumblerette and Releases Free iPhone App|date=February 25, 2009|url=http://mashable.com/2009/02/25/tumblr-iphone-app/|accessdate=March 22, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Tumblr Staff Blog">{{cite web|title=Tumblerette is now the official Tumblr iPhone App!

=== Inbox and messaging ===
Tumblr blogs may optionally allow users to submit questions, either as themselves or anonymously, to the blog for a response. Tumblr also offered a "fan mail" function, allowing users to send messages to blogs that they follow.<ref name=vb-fanmail>{{cite web|title=Tumblr releases Fan Mail for private messaging|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/01/04/tumblr-fan-mail/|website=VentureBeat|accessdate=November 11, 2015|date=January 4, 2012}}</ref><ref name=tc-inbox>{{cite web|title=Tumblr Rolls Out Instant Messaging On Both Web And Mobile|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/10/tumblr-rolls-out-instant-messaging-on-both-web-and-mobile/|website=TechCrunch|publisher=AOL|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}</ref>

On November 10, 2015, Tumblr introduced an integrated [[instant messaging]] function, allowing users to chat with other Tumblr users. The feature was rolled out in a "viral" manner; it was initially made available to a group of 1500 users, and other users could receive access to the messaging system if they were sent a message by any user that had received access to the system itself. The messaging platform replaces the fan mail system, which was deprecated.<ref name=verge-messaging>{{cite web|title=Tumblr launches instant messaging on Android, iOS, and the web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9706232/tumblr-instant-messaging-announced|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|date=November 10, 2015|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}</ref> The ability to send posts to others via the Dashboard was added the following month.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/12/10/tumblr-now-lets-you-send-posts-as-messages-and-supports-live-photos-on-ios/|title=Tumblr now lets you send posts as messages, and supports Live Photos on iOS|last=Swanner|first=Nate|date=December 10, 2015|work=The Next Web|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

In November 2019, Tumblr introduced "group chats"—[[ephemeral]] [[chat room]]s surfaced via searches, designed to allow users to share content in real-time with users who share their interests. Posts disappear after 24 hours and cannot be edited.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/6/20947674/tumblr-feature-group-chats-search-moderation|title=Tumblr just added a group chat function|last=Radulovic|first=Petrana|date=2019-11-06|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref>

In May 2012, Tumblr launched Storyboard, a blog managed by an in-house editorial team which features stories and videos about noteworthy blogs and users on Tumblr.<ref>{{cite web |title = Tumblr's editorial hires lead to "Storyboard," a hub to feature creative users |first = Harrison |last = Weber |url = https://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/05/07/tumblrs-editorial-hires-lead-to-storyboard-a-hub-to-feature-creative-users/ |work = The Next Web |date = May 7, 2012 |accessdate = April 13, 2013 |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6FqTQupCu?url=http://thenextweb.com/apps/2012/05/07/tumblrs-editorial-hires-lead-to-storyboard-a-hub-to-feature-creative-users/ |archive-date = April 13, 2013 |url-status = live |df = mdy-all }}</ref> In April 2013, Storyboard was shut down.<ref>{{cite web |title = Tumblr Kills Storyboard; Editorial Employees Will Be 'Moving On' |first = Kelly |last = Faircloth |url = http://betabeat.com/2013/04/tumblr-editorial-layoffs-storyboard-david-karp/ |work = [[Betabeat]] |date = April 9, 2013 |accessdate = April 13, 2013 |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6FqUZ3nRm?url=http://betabeat.com/2013/04/tumblr-editorial-layoffs-storyboard-david-karp/ |archive-date = April 13, 2013 |url-status = live |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

In March 2018, Tumblr began to syndicate original video content from Verizon-owned video network [[go90]], as part of an ongoing integration of Oath properties, and reported plans to wind down go90 in favor of using Oath properties to distribute its content instead. This made the respective content available internationally, since go90 is a U.S.-only service.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://digiday.com/media/verizon-turns-tumblr-original-show-hub-go90-struggled-become/|title=With Go90 flatlining, Verizon sees Tumblr as home to original digital video programs|date=April 20, 2018|work=[[Digiday]]|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/oath-ceo-tim-armstrong-go90-1202696674/|title=Oath CEO Tim Armstrong Casts Doubt on Future of Go90|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|date=February 13, 2018|work=Variety|access-date=April 24, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Adult content ===
Tumblr has been noted by technology journalists as having had a sizable amount of [[pornography|pornographic content]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Why Yahoo Doesn't Think Tumblr Has a Porn Problem |first=Peter |last=Kafka |url=http://allthingsd.com/20130518/why-yahoo-doesnt-think-tumblr-has-a-porn-problem/ |work=[[All Things Digital]] |date=May 18, 2013 |accessdate=June 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HQ0hICSp?url=http://allthingsd.com/20130518/why-yahoo-doesnt-think-tumblr-has-a-porn-problem/ |archive-date=June 16, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Yahoo to Buy Tumblr for $1.1 Billion |first1=Michael J. |last1=de la Merced |first2=Nick |last2=Bilton |first3=Nicole |last3=Perlroth |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/20/technology/yahoo-to-buy-tumblr-for-1-1-billion.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |page=A1 |date=May 19, 2013 |accessdate=June 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HQ15f0WJ?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/20/technology/yahoo-to-buy-tumblr-for-1-1-billion.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& |archive-date=June 16, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref>
An analysis conducted by news and technology site TechCrunch on May 20, 2013, has shown that over 22% of all traffic in and out of Tumblr was classified as pornography. In addition, a reported 16.45% of blogs on Tumblr exclusively contained pornographic material.

In July 2013, Tumblr began to filter content from adult-tagged blogs from appearing in search results and tag displays unless the user is logged in. In February 2018, Safe Mode (which filters "sensitive" content and blogs) became enabled by default for all users on an opt-out basis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/3k7qe5/turning-tumblr-safe-mode-on-by-default|title=Tumblr Is Turning 'Safe Mode' on by Default for Everyone|date=February 8, 2018|work=Motherboard|access-date=December 4, 2018|language=en-us}}</ref>

On December 3, 2018, Tumblr announced that effective December 17, all images and videos depicting sex acts, and real-life images and videos depicting human genitalia or "female-presenting" nipples, would be banned from the service. Exceptions are provided for illustrations or art that depict nudity, nudity related to "political or newsworthy speech", and depictions of "female-presenting" nipples in relation to medical events such as [[childbirth]], [[breastfeeding]], [[mastectomy]] and [[gender reassignment surgery]]. The rules do not apply to text content. All posts in violation of the policy are hidden from public view, and repeat offenders may be reprimanded.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode|title=Tumblr will ban all adult content on December 17th|work=The Verge|access-date=December 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tumblr.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/231885248-Sensitive-content|title=Adult content|website=Tumblr Help Center|language=en-US|access-date=December 3, 2018}}</ref> Shortly prior to the announcement, Tumblr's [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app was patched to remove the ability to disable Safe Mode.<ref name=":1" />

The change has faced wide criticism among Tumblr's community; in particular, it has been argued that the service should have focused on other major issues (such as controlling [[hate speech]] or the number of porn-related [[spambot]]s on the service), and that the service's adult community provided a platform for [[sex education]], independent adult performers (especially those representing [[LGBT]] communities who feel that they are underrepresented by a [[heteronormative]] mainstream industry) seeking an outlet for their work, and those seeking a safe haven from "over-policed" platforms to share creative work with adult themes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mjxg/apple-tumblr-porn-nsfw-adult-content-banned|title=Apple Sucked Tumblr Into Its Walled Garden, Where Sex Is Bad|date=December 3, 2018|work=Motherboard|access-date=December 4, 2018|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/verizon-takes-aim-at-tumblrs-kneecaps-bans-all-adult-content/|title=Verizon takes aim at Tumblr's kneecaps, bans all adult content|work=Ars Technica|access-date=December 4, 2018|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18127869/tumblr-livejournal-porn-ban-strikethrough|title=Tumblr's porn ban could be its downfall — after all, it happened to LiveJournal|last=Stephen|first=Bijan|date=December 6, 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=December 6, 2018}}</ref> Tumblr stated that it is using various algorithms to detect potential violations, in combination with manual reviews.<ref name=":1" /> Users quickly discovered a wide array of [[false positive]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mn7p/tumblrs-algorithm-thinks-vomiting-unicorns-raw-chicken-and-boot-cleaners-are-porn|title=Tumblr's Algorithm Thinks Vomiting Unicorns, Raw Chicken, and Boot Cleaners Are Porn|last=Rogers|first=Kaleigh|last2=Koebler|first2=Jason|date=December 4, 2018|website=Motherboard|language=en-US|access-date=December 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/4/18125997/tumblr-nsfw-guidelines-flagging-algorithm|title=Tumblr's wonky algorithm is flagging innocent posts as adult content|last=Radulovic|first=Petrana|date=December 4, 2018|website=Polygon|access-date=December 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/tumblr-porn-ai-adult-content/|title=Tumblr's Porn-Detecting AI Has One Job—and It's Bad at It|last=Matsakis|first=Louise|date=December 5, 2018|work=Wired|access-date=December 6, 2018|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> A large number of users scheduled protest actions on December 17th.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/17/18144625/tumblr-nsfw-guidelines-ban-protest|title=Tumblr users are logging off to protest new guidelines, but will it work?|last=Radulovic|first=Petrana|date=December 17, 2018|website=Polygon|access-date=December 18, 2018}}</ref>

On the day the ban took effect, Tumblr issued a new post clarifying the new policy, showcasing examples of adult images still allowed on the service, and stating that it "fully recognized" its "special obligation" to serving its LGBT userbase, and that "LGBTQ+ conversations, exploration of sexuality and gender, efforts to document the lives and challenges of those in the sex worker industry, and posts with pictures, videos, and GIFs of gender-confirmation surgery are all examples of content that is not only permitted on Tumblr but actively encouraged."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/17/as-adult-content-ban-arrives-tumblr-clarifies-and-refines-rules/|title=As adult content ban arrives, Tumblr clarifies and refines rules|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=December 18, 2018}}</ref>

''Wired'' cited multiple potential factors in the ban, including that the presence of adult content made the service unappealing to potential advertisers, the [[Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act]] (a U.S. federal law which makes websites liable for knowingly assisting or facilitating illegal [[sex trafficking]]), as well as heavy restrictions on adult content imposed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] for software offered on the [[iOS App Store]] (which similarly prompted several [[Reddit]] clients to heavily frustrate the ability for users to access forums on the site that contain adult content).<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/tumblrs-porn-ban-reveals-controls-we-see-online/|title=Tumblr's Porn Ban Reveals Who Controls What We See Online|last=Martineau|first=Paris|date=December 4, 2018|work=Wired|access-date=December 9, 2018|issn=1059-1028}}</ref>

===Revenue sources===
In an interview with Nicole Lapin of ''[[Bloomberg West]]'' on September 7, 2012, David Karp said the site was monetized by advertising. Their first advertising launch started in May 2012 after 16 experimental campaigns.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lapin|first=Nicole|title="Tumblr Has 'Ways to Go' Before IPO, CEO Says" 9-5-12|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/tumblr-has-ways-to-go-before-ipo-ceo-says-Y6Yu8w~qQP~MiuZcxhDdnQ.html|accessdate=December 13, 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg West|date=September 5, 2012}}</ref> Tumblr made $13 million in revenue in 2012 and hoped to make $100 million in 2013. Tumblr reportedly spent $25 million to fund operations in 2012.<ref name="Business Insider" />

In 2013, Tumblr began allowing companies to pay to promote their own posts to a larger audience. Tumblr Head of Sales, Lee Brown, has quoted the average ad purchase on Tumblr to be nearly six figures.<ref name=Advertising>{{cite web|last=Frier|first=Sarah|title=Tumblr to Introduce Mobile Advertising to Help Achieve Profit|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-05/tumblr-to-introduce-mobile-advertising-to-help-achieve-profit.html|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}</ref> Tumblr also allows premium theme templates to be sold for use by blogs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-voakes/how-pixel-union-built-a-b_b_3750446.html|title=How Pixel Union Built a Business on Tumblr Themes|last=Voakes|first=Greg|date=August 14, 2013|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=November 21, 2018}}</ref>

In July 2016, advertisements were implemented by default across all blogs. Users may opt-out, and the service stated that a revenue sharing program would be implemented at a later date.<ref name="verge-adsonblogs">{{cite web|title=Tumblr will allow users to make money from ads|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/28/12307484/tumblr-advertising-user-blogs-revenue|website=The Verge|accessdate=October 21, 2016|date=July 28, 2016}}</ref>

==Criticism==
=== Copyright issues ===
Tumblr has received criticism for copyright violations by participating bloggers;<ref name=Supervision /> however, Tumblr accepts [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) [[OCILLA|take-down notices]].<ref name="tumblr dmca form">{{cite web | url=https://www.tumblr.com/dmca | title=DMCA Copyright Notifications | publisher=Tumblr | accessdate=May 20, 2013}}</ref> Tumblr's visual appeal has made it ideal for photoblogs that often include copyrighted works from others that are re-published without payment.<ref name="Why Tumblr must kill">{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Jim|title=Why Tumblr Must Kill What Made it Big: Porn and Copyright Violations|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-tumblr-must-kill-what-made-it-big-porn-and-copyright-violations|accessdate=March 28, 2013|newspaper=CBSNews.com|date=September 12, 2011}}</ref> Tumblr users can post unoriginal content by "Reblogging", a feature on Tumblr that allows users to re-post content taken from another blog onto their own blog with attribution.<ref name=Supervision>{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Jim|title=Why Tumblr Needs Adult Supervision Right Now|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tumblr-fashion-directors-exit-could-mean-entry-of-adult-supervision-2011-11|website=Business Insider}}</ref><ref name=Criticism>{{cite web|title=Tumblr: A New Way of Blogging|url=https://sites.google.com/site/xwarneritessay/5|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}</ref>

=== Security ===
Tumblr has been forced to manage spam and security problems. For example, a chain letter scam in May 2011 affected 130,000 users.<ref name="TheRegisterScam">{{cite web|last=Leyden|first=John|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/17/tumblr_chain_letter_scam/|title=Tumblr bloggrs ensnared in chain-spam scam|website=The Register|date=May 17, 2011|accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref>

On December 3, 2012, Tumblr was attacked by a [[cross-site scripting]] worm deployed by the [[Troll (Internet)|Internet troll]] group [[Gay Nigger Association of America]]. The message urged users to harm themselves and criticized blogging in general.<ref>{{cite web |title = Massive worm hits Tumblr, spams big blogs like USA today |url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57556784-83/massive-worm-hits-tumblr-spams-big-blogs-like-usa-today/ |website = [[CNET]] |date = December 3, 2012 |accessdate = March 30, 2013 }}</ref>

=== User interface changes ===
In 2015, Tumblr faced criticism by users for changes to its reblog mechanisms. In July 2015, the system was modified so that users cannot remove or edit individual comments by other users when reblogging a post; existing comments can only be removed all at once. Tumblr staff argued that the change was intended to combat "misattribution", though this move was met by criticism from ‘ask blogs’ and ‘RP blogs’, which often shortened long chains of reblogs between users to improve readability. In September 2015, Tumblr changed how threads of comments on reblogged posts are displayed; rather than a nested view with indentations for each post, all reblogs are now shown in a flat view, and user avatars were also added. The change was intended to improve the legibility of reblogs, especially on mobile platforms, and complements the inability to edit existing comments. Although some users had requested such a change to combat posts made illegible by extremely large numbers of comments on a reblogged post, the majority of users (even those who had requested such a change) criticized the new format. ''[[The Verge]]'' was also critical of the changes, noting that it was cleaner, but made the site lose its "nostalgic charm".<ref name=dailydot-reblogchange>{{cite web|title=Tumblr users are not happy about the site's new redesign|url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/tumblr-reblog-redesign-2015/|website=The Daily Dot|accessdate=September 7, 2015|date=September 2, 2015}}</ref><ref name=verge-reblogchanges>{{cite web|title=Tumblr reblogs just got a lot cleaner, and a little less charming|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/3/9258925/tumblr-reblogs-redesign-mobile|website=The Verge|accessdate=September 7, 2015|date=September 4, 2015}}</ref>

=== Userbase behaviour ===
While Tumblr's userbase has generally been received as accommodating people from a wide range of ideologies and identities, a common point of criticism is that attitudes from users on the site stifle discussion and discourse. In addition, several incidents involving serious behaviour from the userbase have been publicised in recent years; these include the ‘Independence Day raid’ in 2014, in which users of Tumblr attempted to raid [[4chan]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/2014-tumblr-4chan-raids|title=2014 Tumblr-4chan Raids|website=Know Your Meme|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref> only for the raid to backfire when 4chan retaliated,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvjwXhCNZcU|title=The Tumblr-4chan Wars|date=2020-03-01|website=Internet Historian, YouTube}}</ref> as well as an incident in 2015, in which members of the ''[[Steven Universe]]'' fandom drove an artist to the point of [[Suicide attempt|attempting suicide]] over their artwork, in which they drew characters thin that are typically seen as being 'fat' in the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3da838/an-attempted-suicide-forced-a-tumblr-community-to-open-its-eyes-about-bullying|title=An Attempted Suicide Forced a Tumblr Community to Open Its Eyes About Bullying|last=Nguyen|first=Clinton|date=2015-11-06|website=Vice|language=en|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> In 2018, ''[[Kotaku]]'' reporter Gita Jackson described the site as a 'joyless black hole', citing how the website's design and functionality led to 'fandoms spinning out of control', as well as an environment which inhibited discussion and discourse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/in-2018-tumblr-is-a-joyless-black-hole-1827294865|title=In 2018, Tumblr Is A Joyless Black Hole|website=Kotaku|language=en-us|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>

===Promotion of self-harm and suicide===
In February 2012, Tumblr banned blogs that promote or advocate suicide, self-harm and eating disorders ([[pro-ana]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staff.tumblr.com/post/18132624829/self-harm-blogs|title=A New Policy Against Self-Harm Blogs|work=Tumblr Staff Blog|date=February 23, 2012|accessdate=January 27, 2014}}</ref>

The suicide of a British teenager, Tallulah Wilson, raised the issue of suicide and self-harm promotion on Tumblr as Wilson was reported to have maintained a self-harm blog on the site. A user on the site is reported to have sent Wilson an image of a [[noose]] accompanied by the message: "here is your new necklace, try it on." In response to the Wilson case, [[Maria Miller]], the UK's minister for culture, media, and sport, said that social media sites like Tumblr need to remove "toxic" self-harm content.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/10597877/Maria-Miller-Time-for-a-crackdown-on-social-media-poison.html|title=Maria Miller: Time for a crackdown on social media 'poison'|work=The Telegraph|date=January 27, 2014|accessdate=January 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/27/social-networks-to-face-government-grilling-over-suicide-promotion|title=Social networks to face government grilling over suicide content|work=The Guardian|first=Alex|last=Hern|date=January 27, 2014|accessdate=January 27, 2014}}</ref>

Searching terms like "depression", "anxiety", and "suicide" on Tumblr now brings up a [[Public service announcement|PSA]] page directing the user to resources like the [[National Suicide Prevention Lifeline|national suicide lifeline]], and [[7 Cups]]; as well as an option to continue to the search results.<ref>{{cite web|title=Everything okay?|url=https://www.tumblr.com/psa/search/suicide|website=Tumblr|accessdate=May 21, 2016}}</ref>{{better source|date=November 2018}}

There are concerns of some Tumblr posts glorifying suicide and depression among young people.<ref>Becker, Mayer, Nagenborg, El-Faddagh, & Schmidt, 2004; Duggan, Heath, Lewis, & Baxter, 2012; Lewis, Heath, St. Denis, & Noble, 2011; Mitchell & Ybarra, 2007; Whitlock, Powers, & Eckenrode, 2006</ref>

===Politics===
In February 2018, [[BuzzFeed]] published a report claiming that Tumblr was utilized as a distribution channel for Russian agents to influence American voting habits during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/russian-trolls-ran-wild-on-tumblr-and-the-company-refuses |title=Russian Trolls Ran Rampant On Tumblr And The Company Refuses To Say Anything About It |first=Craig |last=Silverman |publisher=BuzzFeed |date=February 6, 2018 |accessdate=March 12, 2018}}</ref>

Despite policies forbidding hate speech, Tumblr has been noted for hosting content from [[Nazi]]s and [[white supremacist]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/12/04/tumblrs-nudity-crackdown-means-pornography-will-be-harder-find-its-platform-than-nazi-propaganda/|title=Tumblr's nudity ban removes one of the last major refuges for pornography on social media|date=December 3, 2018|website=Washington Post|access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref> In May 2020, Tumblr announced that it will remove reblogs of terminated hate speech posts, specifically Nazi and white supremacist content.<ref>https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21247437/tumblr-hate-speech-reblog-removal-nazis-white-supremacist-content</ref>

=== Censorship ===
Several countries have blocked access to Tumblr because of pornography, religious extremism or LGBT content. These countries include [[China]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.techinasia.com/tumblr-blocked-censored-china | title=Tech in Asia - Connecting Asia's startup ecosystem}}</ref> [[Indonesia]], [[Kazakhstan]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.intellinews.com/kazakhstan-blocks-tumblr-for-promoting-terrorism-porn-94928/ | title=Kazakhstan &#124; Astana blocks Tumblr for promoting terrorism, porn| date=April 12, 2016}}</ref> and [[Iran]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://viewdns.info/research/current-state-of-internet-censorship-in-iran/ | title=Current State of Internet Censorship in Iran - Research - ViewDNS.info}}</ref> In February 2016, the [[Indonesian government]] temporarily blocked access to Tumblr within the country because the site hosts pages that carried porn. The government shortly reversed its decision to block the site and said it had asked Tumblr to [[self-censorship|self-censor]] its pornographic content.<ref>{{cite web |title = Indonesia reverses Tumblr ban, for now |first = Victoria |last = Ho |url = http://mashable.com/2016/02/18/indonesia-reverses-tumblr-ban#rP9KEpoyQZqh |website = [[Mashable]] |date = February 18, 2016 |accessdate = February 29, 2016 |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6feE6l32x?url=http://mashable.com/2016/02/18/indonesia-reverses-tumblr-ban#rP9KEpoyQZqh |archive-date = February 29, 2016 |url-status = live |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

==== Adult content ban ====
In November 2018, Tumblr's [[iOS]] app was removed by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] from its [[App Store (iOS/iPadOS)|App Store]] after illegal child pornography images were found on the service. Tumblr stated that all images uploaded to the service are scanned against an industry database, but that a "routine audit" had revealed images that had not yet been added to the database.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104366/tumblr-ios-app-child-pornography-removed-from-app-store|title=Tumblr was removed from Apple's App Store over child pornography issues|work=The Verge|access-date=November 20, 2018}}</ref> In the wake of the incident, a number of Tumblr blogs—particularly those dealing primarily in adult-tagged artwork such as erotica, as well as [[Study (art)|art study]] and [[human anatomy|anatomy]] resources—were also deleted, with affected users taking to other platforms (such as [[Twitter]]) to warn others and complain about the deletions, as well as encourage users to back up their blog's contents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/365036/tumblr-purges-blogs-after-getting-delisted-from-app-store|title=Tumblr's Child Porn Crackdown Ensnares Legit Blogs in Purge|work=PC Magazine|access-date=November 21, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailydot.com/irl/tumblr-nsfw-artists-purged-child-porn/|title=NSFW artists speak out as their accounts are suddenly 'purged' on Tumblr|date=November 20, 2018|work=The Daily Dot|access-date=November 21, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Tumblr subsequently removed the ability to disable "Safe Mode" from its Android app,<ref name=":1" /> and announced a wider ban on explicit images of sex acts and nudity on the platform with certain limited exceptions.<ref name=":0" /> Tumblr decided to use an [[automatic content recognition]] system which resulted in many non-pornographic images being removed from the platform.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tumblr Launched An Algorithm To Flag Porn And So Far It's Just Caused Chaos |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krishrach/tumblr-porn-algorithm-ban |first=Rachael |last=Krishna |date=4 December 2018 |website=BuzzFeed News |accessdate=19 October 2020}}</ref>
