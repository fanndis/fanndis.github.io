==Formation==

In an interview published by ''[[Vanguard]]'' on 19 April 2015, Buhari, whose [[Buhari Administration|administration]] was to begin on 29 May 2015, said he would assemble a small cabinet that might be active before the official ceremony.<ref name=LevinusNwabughiogu201504>{{cite journal|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/04/why-my-cabinet-will-be-small-president-elect-buhari/|journal=[[Vanguard (Nigeria)]]|accessdate=2015-07-02 |author=Levinus Nwabughiogu|title=Why my cabinet will be small |date=2015-04-19}}</ref> On 31 May 2015 Buhari was reported to have said he would break with the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] (PDP) tradition where ministers were nominated by governors.<ref name=AngelaDavis201505>{{cite journal|url=http://www.newsat247.com/2015/05/presidential-appointments-list-of-ministers-buharis-cabinet/|journal=News247|accessdate=2015-07-02 |author=Angela Davis|title=Presidential Appointments: List Of Ministers (Buhari’s Cabinet)|date=2015-05-31}}</ref>{{efn|By convention, the cabinet contains a minister or minister of state from each of the 36 states.<ref name=FedMinCouncil>{{cite web|url=http://services.gov.ng/the-federal-executive-council|title=The Federal Executive Council|accessdate=2015-07-03|publisher=Federal Ministry of Communication Technology|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704212050/http://services.gov.ng/the-federal-executive-council|archive-date=2015-07-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>}} He would look for people who were competent, dedicated and experienced.<ref name=AngelaDavis201505/> On 1 July 2015 a [[spokesman]] for the [[President (government title)|president]] said that Buhari would delay selecting a cabinet until September. He wanted to eliminate prior corruption before the new ministers were appointed. Another spokesman said that the delay was "nothing out of the ordinary" compared to the formation of previous cabinets. However, a London-based economist said the delay would not be well received by investors.<ref name=ChrisKay2015>{{cite journal|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-01/nigerian-president-to-delay-cabinet-appointments-until-september|accessdate=2015-07-02
