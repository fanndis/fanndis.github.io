== Legacy & style ==
Mitchell has been praised for documenting nuanced expressions of black life, which he has referred to as a "Black utopic vision".<ref name=":3" /> His exhibition, ''I Can Make You Feel Good'', features photographs of black people enjoying daily life, predominantly outdoors, which the New York Times asserts "challenges the art historical renderings of leisure time as the purview of the white gentry." He explores cultural reclamation in his professional work as fashion photographer.<ref name=":3" />

Mitchell cites [[Ryan McGinley]] and [[Larry Clark (disambiguation)|Larry Clark]] as early influences. His work has also been contextualized in reference to artists [[Kehinde Wiley]], [[Jamel Shabazz]], [[Nadine Ijewere]], Dana Scruggs, and Campbell Addy.<ref name=":3" />
