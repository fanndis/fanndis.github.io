==Early life and education==
{{Primary sources section|date=March 2019}}
Nazarbayev was born in [[Chemolgan]], a rural town near [[Almaty]], when Kazakhstan [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|was one of the republics]] of the [[Soviet Union]], to parents Ábish Nazarbayev (1903–1971) and Aljan Nazarbayeva (1910–1977).<ref>{{harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=11}}</ref> His father Ábish was a poor labourer who worked for a wealthy local family until Soviet rule confiscated the family's farmland in the 1930s during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] policy.<ref>{{harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=16}}</ref> Following this, his father took the family to the mountains to live out a nomadic existence.<ref>{{harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=20}}</ref> His family's religious tradition was [[Sunni Islam]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Ábish avoided compulsory military service due to a withered arm he had sustained when putting out a fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=21}}</ref> At the end of [[World War II]], the family returned to the village of Chemolgan, and Nazarbayev began to learn the [[Russian language]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=22}}</ref> He performed well at school and was sent to a boarding school in [[Kaskelen]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=23}}</ref>

After leaving school, Nazarbayev took up a one-year, government-funded scholarship at the Karaganda Steel Mill in [[Temirtau]].<ref name="page 24">{{harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=24}}</ref> He also spent time training at a steel plant in [[Kamianske|Dniprodzerzhynsk]], and therefore was away from Temirtau when riots broke out there over working conditions.<ref name="page 24"/> By the age of 20, he was earning a relatively good wage doing "incredibly heavy and dangerous work" in the blast furnace.<ref name="=page 26">{{harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=26}}</ref>

Nazarbayev joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] in 1962, becoming a prominent member of the Young Communist League ([[Komsomol]])<ref name="=page 26"/> and full-time worker for the party, and attended the Karagandy Polytechnic Institute.<ref name="page 27">{{harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=27}}</ref> He was appointed secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the Karaganda Metallurgical Kombinat in 1972, and four years later became Second Secretary of the Karaganda Regional Party Committee.<ref name="page 27"/>

In his role as a bureaucrat, Nazarbayev dealt with legal papers, logistical problems, and industrial disputes, as well as meeting workers to solve individual issues.<ref name="page 27"/> He later wrote that "the central allocation of capital investment and the distribution of funds" meant that infrastructure was poor, workers were demoralised and overworked, and centrally set targets were unrealistic; he saw the steel plant's problems as a microcosm for the problems for the Soviet Union as a whole.<ref>{{harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=28}}</ref>

In 1984, Nazarbayev became the [[Prime Minister of Kazakhstan]] (Chairman of the Council of Ministers), under [[Dinmukhamed Kunayev]], the [[General Secretary|First Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]].<ref name="ZHELTOQSAN">{{cite book|author=Sally N.

Dinmukhamed Kunayev, Nazarbayev's boss and Askar's brother, felt deeply angered and betrayed. Kunayev went to [[Moscow]] and demanded Nazarbayev's dismissal while Nazarbayev's supporters campaigned for Kunayev's dismissal and Nazarbayev's promotion.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Kunayev was ousted in 1986 and replaced by a Russian, [[Gennady Kolbin]], who despite his office had little authority in Kazakhstan. Nazarbayev was named party leader on 22 June 1989,<ref name=ZHELTOQSAN/> only the second Kazakh (after Kunayev) to hold the post. He was [[List of Presidents of Kazakhstan|Chairman of the Supreme Soviet]] ([[List of Presidents of Kazakhstan|head of state]]) from 22 February to 24 April 1990.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

On [[1990 Kazakh presidential election|24 April 1990]], Nazarbayev was named the first [[List of Presidents of Kazakhstan|President of Kazakhstan]] by the [[Supreme Soviet]]. He supported Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] against the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|attempted coup in August 1991]] by [[State Committee on the State of Emergency|Soviet hardliners]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=73}}</ref> Nazarbayev was close enough to Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] for Gorbachev to consider him for the post of [[Vice President of the Soviet Union]]; however, Nazarbayev turned the offer down. However, on July 29, Gorbavhev, Yeltsin, and Nazarbayez discussed and decided that once the [[New Union Treaty]] was signed, Nazarbayev would replace [[Valentin Pavlov]] as [[Prime Minister|Premier of the Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/614785/Union-of-Soviet-Socialist-Republics|title=Union of Soviet Socialist Republics - historical state, Eurasia|access-date=24 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012094414/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/614785/Union-of-Soviet-Socialist-Republics|archive-date=12 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Soviet Union disintegrated following the failed coup, though Nazarbayev was highly concerned with maintaining the close economic ties between Kazakhstan and Russia.<ref>{{harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=81}}</ref> In the country's [[1991 Kazakh presidential election|first presidential election]], held on 1 December, he appeared alone on the ballot and won 95% of the vote.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Minahan|title=Miniature empires: a historical dictionary of the newly independent states|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RSxt-JB-PDkC&pg=PA136|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30610-5|page=136|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527222648/http://books.google.com/books?id=RSxt-JB-PDkC&pg=PA136|archive-date=27 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> On 21 December, he signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]], taking Kazakhstan into the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nazarbayev|1998|p=82}}</ref>

Nazarbayev renamed the former State Defense Committees as the Ministry of Defense and appointed [[Sagadat Nurmagambetov]] as [[Defense Minister]] on 7 May 1992. The [[Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR|Supreme Soviet]], under the leadership of Chairman [[Serikbolsyn Abdildin|Serikbolsyn Abdilin]], began debating over a draft constitution in June 1992. The constitution created a strong [[executive branch]] with limited [[Separation of powers|checks]] on executive power.<ref name="Cambridge University Press">{{cite book|author1=Karen Dawisha|author2=Bruce Parrott|title=Russia and the new states of Eurasia: the politics of upheaval|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8P3pOV4CWJsC&pg=PA317|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45895-5|pages=317–318|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527175842/http://books.google.com/books?id=8P3pOV4CWJsC&pg=PA317|archive-date=27 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

Opposition political parties [[Azat Civil Movement of Kazakhstan|Azat]], [[Jeltoqsan National Democratic Party|Jeltoqsan]] and the [[Azat Republican Party of Kazakhstan|Republican Party]], held demonstrations in [[Almaty]] from 10 to 17 June 1992 calling for the formation of a [[coalition government]] and the resignation of the government of Prime Minister [[Sergey Tereshchenko]] and the [[Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR|Supreme Council]]. The [[Parliament of Kazakhstan]], composed of Communist Party legislators who had yet to stand in an election since the country gained independence, adopted the constitution on 28 January 1993.<ref name="Cambridge University Press"/>

An [[1995 Kazakh presidential term referendum|April 1995 referendum]] extended Nazarbayev's term until 2000. He was re-elected in [[1999 Kazakh presidential election|January 1999]] and again in [[2005 Kazakh presidential election|December 2005]]. The [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] criticized the last presidential election as falling short of international democratic standards.<ref>[http://www.osce.org/odihr-elections/16471.html Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights – Elections]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709175625/http://www.osce.org/odihr-elections/16471.html|date=9 July 2015}}</ref> On 18 May 2007, the [[Parliament of Kazakhstan]] approved a [[2007 Amendment to the Kazakhstani Constitution|constitutional amendment]] which allowed the incumbent president—himself—to run for an unlimited number of five-year terms. This amendment applied specifically and only to Nazarbayev: the original constitution's prescribed maximum of two five-year terms will still apply to all future presidents of Kazakhstan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/19/world/fg-kazakh19|title=Kazakhstan lifts term limits on long-ruling leader|last=Holley|first=David|date=19 May 2007|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=20 March 2019|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110225730/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/19/world/fg-kazakh19|archive-date=10 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nazarbayev appointed [[Altynbek Sarsenbayev]], who at the time served as the Minister of Culture, Information and Concord, the Secretary of the [[Security Council of Kazakhstan|Security Council]], replacing [[Marat Tazhin]], on 4 May 2001.

Notwithstanding Kazakhstan's membership in the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]]), under Nazarbayev the country has had good relations with [[Israel]].

Nazarbayev has always emphasised the role of education in the nation's social development.

In December 2012, Nazarbayev outlined a forward-looking national strategy called the [[Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2013/02/21/kazakhstan-2050-strategy-leads-to-government-restructuring-pub-51010|title=Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy Leads to Government Restructuring|last=Keene|first=Eli|work=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|access-date=2017-10-31|language=en|date=21 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110201305/http://carnegieendowment.org/2013/02/21/kazakhstan-2050-strategy-leads-to-government-restructuring-pub-51010|archive-date=10 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2014, Nazarbayev suggested that Kazakhstan should change its name to "Kazakh Yeli" ("Country of the Kazakhs"), for the country to attract better and more foreign investment, since "Kazakhstan" by its name is associated with other "[[-stan]]" countries. Nazarbayev noted [[Mongolia]] receives more investment than Kazakhstan because it is not a "-stan" country, even though it is in the same neighborhood, and not as stable as Kazakhstan. However, he is letting the people decide on whether the country should change its name.{{clarify|date=September 2018}}<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/02/07/yes-kazakhstan-should-change-its-name-this-map-shows-why/|work=The Washington Post|title=WorldViews|access-date=7 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705123146/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/02/07/yes-kazakhstan-should-change-its-name-this-map-shows-why/|archive-date=5 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-26082740|title=Kazakhstan: President suggests renaming the country|work=BBC|date=7 February 2014|accessdate=21 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140710004226/http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-26082740|archive-date=10 July 2014|url-status=live }}</ref>

Over the course of Nazarbayev's presidency, an increasing number of accusations of corruption and favoritism have been directed against Nazarbayev and his circle. Critics say that the country's government has come to resemble a clan system.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martha Brill Olcott|title=Kazakhstan: Unfulfilled Promise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Tom2gU6rzIC&pg=PA27|date=1 September 2010|publisher=Carnegie Endowment|isbn=978-0-87003-299-8|pages=27–28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603195130/https://books.google.com/books?id=8Tom2gU6rzIC&pg=PA27|archive-date=3 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

In May 2007, the [[Parliament of Kazakhstan]] approved a constitutional amendment which would allow Nazarbayev to seek re-election as many times as he wishes. This amendment applies specifically and only to Nazarbayev, since it states that the first president will have no limits on how many times he can run for office, but subsequent presidents will be restricted to a five-year term.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holley|first=David|title=Kazakhstan lifts term limits on long-ruling leader|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/19/world/fg-kazakh19|accessdate=2 April 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=19 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110225730/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/19/world/fg-kazakh19|archive-date=10 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Iran===
In a speech given in December 2006 marking the fifteenth anniversary of Kazakhstan's independence, Nazarbayev stated he wished to join with Iran in support of a single currency for all Central Asian states and intended to push the idea forward with the President of Iran, [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], on an upcoming visit. The Kazakh president also reportedly criticised Iran as a terrorism-supporting state. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry released a statement on 19 December, saying the reports were mistaken and contradictory to what the president actually meant.<ref name="IRAN">{{cite web|url=http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-20/0612194917171736.htm|title=Kazakhstan dismisses alleged anti-Iran comments from president|accessdate=3 January 2007|url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308054557/http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/line-20/0612194917171736.htm |archive-date=8 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}.

Nazarbayev put forward the initiative of holding a forum of world and traditional religions in Astana. Earlier the organisers of similar events were only representatives of leading religions and denominations. Among other similar events aimed at establishing interdenominational dialogue were the meetings of representatives of world religions and denominations held in [[Assisi]], [[Italy]], in October 1986 and January 2002.<ref>[http://www.religions-congress.org/content/view/15/34/lang,english/ Congress of World Religions – About Congress of leaders of world and traditional religions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107004910/http://www.religions-congress.org/content/view/15/34/lang,english/ |date=7 November 2017 }}.

Nazarbayev initially espoused [[anti-religious]] views during the Soviet era;<ref name="autogenerated1">Ideology and National Identity in Post-Communist Foreign Policies By Rick Fawn, p. 147</ref> he later made attempts to support [[Muslim]] heritage by performing the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage,<ref name="autogenerated1"/> and supporting mosque renovations.<ref>[http://mnweekly.ru/local/20070614/55257858.html Moscow's Largest Mosque to Undergo Extension] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204171503/http://mnweekly.ru/local/20070614/55257858.html|date=4 February 2009}}</ref>

Under the leadership of Nazarbayev, the Republic of Kazakhstan enacted some degrees of multiculturalism in order to retain and attract talents from diverse ethnic groups among its citizenry, and even from nations that are developing ties of cooperation with the country, in order to coordinate human resources onto the state-guided path of global market economic participation. This principle of the Kazakh leadership has earned it the name "Singapore of the Steppes".<ref>{{cite news|last=Preston|first=Peter|title=How Nursultan became the most loved man on Earth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/19/nazarbayev-kazakhstan-jonathen-aitken|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 July 2009|access-date=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305031923/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/19/nazarbayev-kazakhstan-jonathen-aitken|archive-date=5 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Nazarbayev made critical remarks against the veil, choosing to highlight Turkic traditions over [[Islam]] by claiming that "We are Turks, not Arabs" in an open reference to the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] heritage while attacking [[Arabs|Arab]] heritage.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

===Human rights record===
{{main|Human rights in Kazakhstan}}

Kazakhstan's human rights situation under Nazarbayev is uniformly described as poor by independent observers. [[Human Rights Watch]] says that "Kazakhstan heavily restricts freedom of assembly, speech, and religion. In 2014, authorities closed newspapers, jailed or fined dozens of people after peaceful but unsanctioned protests, and fined or detained worshippers for practicing religion outside state controls. Government critics, including opposition leader [[Vladimir Kozlov (politician)|Vladimir Kozlov]], remained in detention after unfair trials. In mid-2014, Kazakhstan adopted new criminal, criminal executive, criminal procedural, and administrative codes, and a new law on trade unions, which contain articles restricting fundamental freedoms and are incompatible with international standards. Torture remains common in places of detention."<ref name="World Report 2015: Kazakhstan">[[Human Rights Watch]], [https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/kazakhstan World Report 2015: Kazakhstan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028020227/https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/kazakhstan|date=28 October 2016}}.

According to a US government report released in 2014, in Kazakhstan:

{{quote|The law does not require police to inform detainees that they have the right to an attorney, and police did not do so. Human rights observers alleged that law enforcement officials dissuaded detainees from seeing an attorney, gathered evidence through preliminary questioning before a detainee’s attorney arrived, and in some cases used corrupt defense attorneys to gather evidence. [...]

The law does not adequately provide for an independent judiciary. The executive branch sharply limited judicial independence. Prosecutors enjoyed a quasi-judicial role and had the authority to suspend court decisions. Corruption was evident at every stage of the judicial process. Although judges were among the most highly paid government employees, lawyers and human rights monitors alleged that judges, prosecutors, and other officials solicited bribes in exchange for favorable rulings in the majority of criminal cases.<ref name=countryreport>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2013&dlid=220395#wrapper "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2013: Kazakhstan"], released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.

==In popular culture==
Nazarbayev is portrayed by [[Romanians|Romanian]] [[actor]] Dani Popescu in the 2020 film [[Borat Subsequent Moviefilm|''Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan'']], in which he is depicted as a leader who apparently wants to be part of [[Donald Trump]]’s “strongman club” alongside the likes of [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Kanye West|Kenneth West]], recruiting the titular [[Borat Sagdiyev]] ([[Sacha Baron Cohen]]) to return to the [[United States]] to [[bribe]] [[Mike Pence|Mikhael Pence]] with a gift of the country's beloved Jonny the Monkey, who is thereafter eaten by Borat's [[stowaway]] daughter Tutar ([[Maria Bakalova]]), after which point Nazarbayev faxes Borat to have him present Tutar as a [[bride]] to Pence on his suggestion, later to [[Rudy Giuliani]] when Borat proves unable to. After Borat and Tutar return to Kazakhstan awaiting [[execution]] after failing to fulfill Nazarbayev's wishes, Nazarbayev instead states that "everyone makes mistakes" and offers Borat [[vodka]] before leaving, immediately after which point Borat and Tutar discover from looking at the walls of Nazarbayev's that Nazarbayev had masterminded the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] by injecting Borat himself with [[Coronavirus disease 2019|the original strain]] so that he would serve as an asymptomatic carrier and [[index case]] in his travels across the world en route to the Americas. Confronting Nazarbayev, who reveals his motivation for having spread the virus to be routed from how the world treated Kazakhstan after the release of the first film [[Borat|''Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan'']] fourteen years previously, Borat and Tutar record his [[confession]] on a [[smartphone]], coercing him into overturning the country's various [[Sexism|sexist]] laws and making it a [[Feminism|feminist]] nation, and replacing the previously abandoned much-beloved "Running of the [[Jews|Jew]]" [[festival]] with the "Running of the [[Yankee]]".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Reilly |first=Dan |date=October 22, 2020 |title=Who's Who in ''Borat 2'': A Guide to Every Notable Cameo |url=https://www.vulture.com/article/whos-who-in-borat-2-a-guide-to-every-notable-cameo.html |access-date=October 22, 2020 |website=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]] |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Ebiri |first=Bilge |date=October 21, 2020 |title=We Should Be Glad Borat Still Exists |url=https://www.vulture.com/article/borat-2-review-subsequent-moviefilm-with-sacha-baron-cohen.html |access-date=October 22, 2020 |website=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]] |language=en-us}}</ref>
