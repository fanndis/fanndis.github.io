Truman's own archived correspondence suggests that he regularly used the period when writing his name.<ref name=LibraryPeriod>{{cite web | publisher = Harry S.

Truman's Name | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/speriod.htm | accessdate = March 5, 2016}}</ref>}} (May 8, 1884 – December 26, 1972) was the 33rd [[president of the United States]] from 1945 to 1953, succeeding upon the [[Death of Franklin D. Roosevelt|death of]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] after serving as the 34th [[vice president of the United States|vice president]]. He implemented the [[Marshall Plan]] to rebuild the economy of [[Western Europe]], and established the [[Truman Doctrine]] and [[NATO]].

Truman grew up in [[Independence, Missouri]], and during [[World War I]] was sent to [[France]] as a captain in the Field Artillery. Returning home, he opened a [[haberdasher]]y in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and was later elected as a [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] official in 1922. Truman was elected to the [[United States Senate]] from [[Missouri]] in 1934 and gained national prominence as chairman of the [[Truman Committee]] aimed at reducing waste and inefficiency in wartime contracts. Soon after succeeding to the presidency he authorized the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first and only use of nuclear weapons in war]]. Truman's administration engaged in an [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] foreign policy and renounced [[isolationism]]. He rallied his [[New Deal coalition]] during the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 presidential election]] and won a surprise victory that secured his own presidential term.

After the onset of the [[Cold War]], Truman oversaw the [[Berlin Airlift]] and [[Marshall Plan]] in 1948. When [[North Korea]] invaded [[First Republic of Korea|South Korea]] in 1950, he gained [[United Nations]] approval to intervene in what became known as the [[Korean War]]. On domestic issues, bills endorsed by Truman faced opposition from a [[Conservative coalition|conservative Congress]], but his administration successfully guided the U.S. economy through the post-war economic challenges. In 1948, he submitted the first comprehensive civil rights legislation and issued [[Executive Order 9981]] to start racial integration in the military and federal agencies.

Corruption in the Truman administration became a central campaign issue in the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 presidential election]]. After [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s electoral victory against Democrat [[Adlai Stevenson II]], Truman went into a financially difficult retirement, marked by the founding of his presidential library and the publication of his memoirs. When he left office, Truman's presidency was criticized, though [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|critical reassessment]] of his tenure has been favorable.

==Early life, family, and education==

Truman was born in [[Lamar, Missouri]], on May 8, 1884, the oldest child of John Anderson Truman and [[Martha Ellen Young Truman]]. He was named for his maternal uncle, Harrison "Harry" Young. His middle name, "S", honors his grandfathers, Anderson Shipp Truman and Solomon Young.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=37}}{{efn|name=initialS}} A brother, John Vivian, was born soon after Harry, followed by sister Mary Jane.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=27, 37}} Truman's ancestry is primarily [[English Americans|English]] with some [[Scots-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]], [[German Americans|German]], and [[French Americans|French]].<ref>{{cite web |author1= Niel Johnson |author2= Verna Gail Johnson |title=Rooted in History: The Genealogy of Harry S.

[[File:Harry ca. 1897.jpg|thumb|left|Truman at age 13 in 1897]]

John Truman was a farmer and livestock dealer. The family lived in Lamar until Harry was ten months old, when they moved to a farm near [[Harrisonville, Missouri]]. The family next moved to [[Belton, Missouri|Belton]], and in 1887 to his grandparents' {{convert|600|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm in [[Grandview, Missouri|Grandview]].{{sfn|Truman Library, Birth|2012}} When Truman was six, his parents moved to [[Independence, Missouri]], so he could attend the [[Presbyterian]] Church Sunday School. He did not attend a traditional school until he was eight.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=37, 77, 1112}} While living in Independence, he served as a [[Shabbos goy]] for Jewish neighbors, doing tasks for them on [[Shabbat]] that their religion prevented them from doing on that day.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Devine, Michael J.|title=Harry S.

Truman was interested in music, reading, and history, all encouraged by his mother, with whom he was very close. As president, he solicited political as well as personal advice from her.{{sfn|Oshinsky|2004|pp=365–380}} He rose at five every morning to practice the piano, which he studied more than twice a week until he was fifteen, becoming quite a skilled player.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=38}} Truman worked as a [[page (servant)|page]] at the [[1900 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]];{{sfn | Ferrell |1994|p=87}} his father had many friends who were active in the Democratic Party and helped young Harry to gain his first political position.{{sfn|Truman Library|2012aa}}

After graduating from [[William Chrisman High School|Independence High School]] in 1901, Truman enrolled in Spalding's Commercial College, a Kansas City business school. He studied bookkeeping, shorthand, and typing, but left after a year.{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=25–26}}

== Working career ==

Truman made use of his business college experience to obtain a job as a timekeeper on the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway]], sleeping in [[hobo]] camps near the rail lines.{{sfn |Truman Library, Job|2012}} He then took on a series of clerical jobs, and was employed briefly in the mail room of ''[[The Kansas City Star]]''. Truman and his brother Vivian later worked as clerks at the [[National Bank of Commerce (Kansas City)|National Bank of Commerce]] in Kansas City.

[[File:Trumanhist.JPG|thumb|left|[[Harry S. Truman National Historic Site|Truman's home]] in [[Independence, Missouri]]]]

He returned to the Grandview farm in 1906, where he lived until entering the army in 1917.{{sfn | McCullough |1992|pp=67, 99}} During this period, he courted [[Bess Truman|Bess Wallace]]. He proposed in 1911, but she turned him down. Truman later said he intended to propose again, but he wanted to have a better income than that earned by a farmer.{{sfn| McCullough | 1992 |pp= 78–79}} To that end, during his years on the farm and immediately after World War I, he became active in several business ventures, including a lead and zinc mine near [[Commerce, Oklahoma]],{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=52}} a company that bought land and leased the oil drilling rights to prospectors,{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=53}} and speculation in Kansas City real estate.{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=79}} Truman occasionally derived some income from these enterprises, but none proved successful in the long term.<ref>{{cite book |last= KirKendall |first=Richard Stewart |date=1989 |title=The Harry S.

Truman is the only president since [[William McKinley]] (elected in 1896) who did not earn a college degree.<ref>{{cite book |last=Danilov |first=Victor J. |date=2013 |title=Famous Americans: A Directory of Museums, Historic Sites, and Memorials |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kWsrAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA268 |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=268 |isbn=978-0-8108-9185-2}}</ref> In addition to having briefly attended business college, from 1923 to 1925 he took night courses toward an [[bachelor of laws|LL.B.]] at the Kansas City Law School (now the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law]]), but dropped out after losing reelection as county judge.{{sfn | Hamby |1995|pp=17–18, 135}} He was informed by attorneys in the Kansas City area that his education and experience were probably sufficient to receive a license to practice law. However, he did not pursue it, because he won election as presiding judge.<ref>{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Richard Lawrence |date=1986 |title=Truman: The Rise to Power |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tF0aAQAAIAAJ&q=%22professional+courtesy%22 |location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=206 |isbn=978-0-07-042185-1}}</ref>

While serving as president in 1947, Truman applied for a license to practice law.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gross |first=Norman |date=2004 |title=America's Lawyer-Presidents: From Law Office to Oval Office |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMKRAAAAMAAJ&q=%22law+license+from+harry+s.+truman%22 |location=Evanston, IL |publisher=Northwestern University Press |page=260 |isbn=978-0-8101-1218-6}}</ref> A friend who was an attorney began working out the arrangements, and informed Truman that his application had to be notarized. By the time Truman received this information he had changed his mind, so he never sought notarization. After rediscovery of Truman's application, in 1996 the [[Missouri Supreme Court]] issued Truman a posthumous honorary law license.<ref>{{cite news |last=Jackman |first=Tom (''Kansas City Star'') |date=September 20, 1996 |title=49 Years Later, Truman Gets His Law License |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1817&dat=19960920&id=yXo0AAAAIBAJ&pg=7058,3681527 |newspaper=Tuscaloosa News |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |page=1D }}</ref>

== Military service ==
===National Guard===
Because he lacked the funds for college, Truman considered attending the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, which had no tuition, but he was refused an appointment because of poor eyesight.{{sfn|Hamby|1995|pp=17–18, 135}} He enlisted in the [[Missouri National Guard]] in 1905, and served until 1911 in the Kansas City-based [[Artillery battery|Battery]] B, 2nd Missouri Field Artillery Regiment, in which he attained the rank of [[Corporal#United States|corporal]].{{sfn|Gilwee|2000}} At his induction, his eyesight without glasses was an unacceptable [[Visual acuity|20/50]] in the right eye and 20/400 in the left (past the standard for legal blindness).{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=105}} The second time he took the test, he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart.{{sfn|Truman Library, Eye|2012}} He was described as 5 feet 10 inches tall, [[gray eyed]], dark haired and of light complexion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/ww1/documents/index.php?documentid=324&pagenumber=3|title=Harry S.

===World War I===
When the United States entered [[World War I]], Truman rejoined Battery B, successfully recruiting new soldiers for the expanding unit, for which he was elected as their [[First lieutenant#U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force|first lieutenant]].<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Ferrell |editor-first=Robert H. |date=1998 |title=Dear Bess: The Letters from Harry to Bess Truman, 1910–1959 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6y0odeAgVDwC&pg=PA219 |location=Columbia, MO |publisher=University of Missouri Press |page=219 |isbn=978-0-8262-1203-0}}</ref> Before deployment to France, Truman was sent for training to [[Camp Doniphan, Oklahoma|Camp Doniphan]], [[Fort Sill]], near [[Lawton, Oklahoma]] when his regiment was federalized as the [[129th Field Artillery Regiment|129th Field Artillery]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Offner |first=Arnold A. |date=2002 |title=Another Such Victory: President Truman and the Cold War, 1945–1953 |url=https://archive.org/details/anothersuchvicto00offn |url-access=registration |location=Stanford, CA |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-4254-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/anothersuchvicto00offn/page/6 6] |ref={{sfnRef|''Another Such Victory''}}}}</ref> The regimental commander during its training was [[Robert M. Danford]], who later served as the Army's Chief of Field Artillery.{{sfn|''Another Such Victory''|page=6}} Truman later said he learned more practical, useful information from Danford in six weeks than from six months of formal Army instruction, and when Truman later served as an artillery instructor, he consciously patterned his approach on Danford's.{{sfn|''Another Such Victory''|page=6}}

Truman also ran the camp [[post exchange|canteen]] with [[Edward Jacobson]], a clothing store clerk he knew from Kansas City. Unlike most canteens funded by unit members, which usually lost money, the canteen operated by Truman and Jacobson turned a profit, returning each soldier's initial $2 investment and $10,000 in dividends in six months.{{sfn |Gilwee| 2000}} At Fort Sill, Truman met Lieutenant James M. Pendergast, nephew of [[Tom Pendergast]], a Kansas City political boss, a connection which had a profound influence on Truman's later life.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=105–110}}{{sfn|Giangreco|2012}}

In mid-1918, about one million soldiers of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] were in France.{{sfn|Current|Freidel|Williams|1971|p=594}} Truman was promoted to [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] effective April 23,<ref>[https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/library/research-files/announcement-harry-s-trumans-promotion-captain Announcement of Harry S. Truman's Promotion to Captain, May 2, 1918]</ref> and in July became commander of the newly arrived Battery D, 129th Field Artillery, [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th Division]].{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=115}}<ref>[https://www.nationalguard.mil/Resources/Image-Gallery/Historical-Paintings/Heritage-Series/Trumans-Battery/ "Truman's Battery"]</ref> Battery D was known for its discipline problems, and Truman was initially unpopular because of his efforts to restore order.{{sfn|Gilwee|2000}} Despite attempts by the men to intimidate him into quitting, Truman succeeded by making his corporals and sergeants accountable for discipline. He promised to back them up if they performed capably, and reduce them to private if they did not.{{sfn|Burnes|2003|p=49}} In an event memorialized in battery lore as "The Battle of Who Run", his soldiers began to flee during a sudden night attack by the Germans in the [[Vosges Mountains]]; Truman succeeded at ordering his men to stay and fight, using profanity from his railroad days. The men were so surprised to hear Truman use such language that they immediately obeyed.{{sfn|Gilwee|2000}}

Truman's unit joined in a massive prearranged assault barrage on September 26, 1918, at the opening of the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Farinacci |first= Donald J. |date=2017 |title=Truman and MacArthur: Adversaries for a Common Cause |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HV8lDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA72 |location=Hoosick Falls, NY |publisher=Merriam Press |pages=71–72 |isbn=978-1-57638-630-9 |ref={{sfnRef|Farinacci}}}}</ref> They advanced with difficulty over [[Zone rouge|pitted terrain]] to follow the infantry, and set up an observation post west of [[Cheppy]].{{sfn|Farinacci|pages=71–72}} On September 27, Truman saw through his binoculars an enemy artillery battery setting up across a river in a position allowing them to fire upon the neighboring [[28th Division (United States)|28th Division]].{{sfn|Farinacci|pages=71–72}} Truman's orders limited him to targets facing the 35th Division, but he ignored this and patiently waited until the Germans had walked their horses well away from their guns, ensuring they could not relocate out of range of Truman's battery.{{sfn|Farinacci|pages=71–72}} He then ordered his men to open fire, and their attack destroyed the enemy battery.{{sfn|Farinacci|pages=71–72}} His actions were credited with saving the lives of 28th Division soldiers who otherwise would have come under fire from the Germans.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=130, 531}}{{sfn|Giangreco|2002|p=192}} Truman was given a dressing down by his regimental commander, Colonel Karl D. Klemm, who threatened to convene a court-martial, but Klemm never followed through, and Truman was not punished.{{sfn|Farinacci|pages=71–72}}

In other action during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, Truman's battery provided support for [[George S. Patton]]'s tank brigade,{{sfn|Giangreco|2002|pp=181–186}} and fired some of the last shots of the war on November 11, 1918. Battery D did not lose any men while under Truman's command in France. To show their appreciation of his leadership, his men presented him with a large [[loving cup]] upon their return to the United States after the war.{{sfn|Gilwee|2000}}

The war was a transformative experience in which Truman manifested his leadership qualities. He had entered the service in 1917 as a family farmer who had worked in clerical jobs that did not require the ability to motivate and direct others, but during the war he gained leadership experience and a record of success that greatly enhanced and supported his post-war political career in Missouri.{{sfn|Gilwee|2000}}

[[File:TrumanWedding.PNG|thumb|alt=Wedding photo of Truman in gray suit and his wife in hat with white dress holding flowers |Harry and Bess Truman on their wedding day, {{nowr|June 28, 1919}}]]

After his wartime service, Truman returned to Independence, where he married Bess Wallace on June 28, 1919.{{sfn|Truman Library|1919}} The couple had one child, [[Margaret Truman|Mary Margaret Truman]].{{sfn|Goldstein | 2008}}

Shortly before the wedding, Truman and Jacobson opened a haberdashery together at 104 West 12th Street in downtown [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt during the [[Post-World War I recession|recession of 1921]].{{sfn|Oshinsky|2004|pp=365–380}} Truman did not pay off the last of the debts from that venture until 1935, when he did so with the aid of banker [[William T. Kemper]], who worked behind the scenes to enable Truman's brother Vivian to buy Truman's $5,600 [[Loan agreement|promissory note]] during the asset sale of a bank that had failed in the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn |McCullough|1992|pp =63–64, 68}}{{sfn | Ferrell |1994|p=88}} The note had risen and fallen in value as it was bought and sold, interest accumulated and Truman made payments, so by the time the last bank to hold it failed, it was worth nearly $9,000.{{sfn | Ferrell |1994|p=86}} Thanks to Kemper's efforts, Vivian Truman was able to buy it for $1,000.{{sfn | Ferrell |1994|p=88}} Jacobson and Truman remained close friends even after their store failed, and Jacobson's advice to Truman on [[Zionism]] later played a role in the U.S. Government's decision to recognize Israel.{{sfn|Hamby|1995|pp=410–412}}

With the help of the Kansas City [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[political machine|machine]] led by [[Tom Pendergast]], Truman was elected in 1922 as County Court judge of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]'s eastern district—Jackson County's three-judge court included judges from the western district (Kansas City), the eastern district (the county outside Kansas City), and a presiding judge elected countywide. This was an administrative rather than a judicial court, similar to county commissioners in many other jurisdictions. Truman lost his 1924 reelection campaign in a Republican wave led by President [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s [[1924 United States presidential election|landslide election]] to a full term. Two years selling automobile club memberships convinced him that a public service career was safer for a family man approaching middle age, and he planned a run for [[List of county executives of Jackson County, Missouri|presiding judge]] in 1926.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|p=6}}

Truman won the job in 1926 with the support of the Pendergast machine, and he was re-elected in 1930. As presiding judge, Truman helped coordinate the ''Ten Year Plan'', which transformed Jackson County and the Kansas City skyline with new public works projects, including an extensive series of roads and construction of a new [[Wight and Wight]]-designed County Court building. Also in 1926, he became president of the [[National Old Trails Road]] Association. He oversaw the dedication in the late 1920s of a series of [[Madonna of the Trail]] monuments honoring 12 pioneer women.{{sfn|Dallek|2008| p = 6}}{{sfn|Barr|2004}}

In 1933, Truman was named Missouri's director for the Federal Re-Employment program (part of the [[Civil Works Administration]]) at the request of Postmaster General [[James Farley]]. This was payback to Pendergast for delivering the Kansas City vote to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 presidential election]]. The appointment confirmed Pendergast's control over federal [[patronage]] jobs in Missouri and marked the zenith of his power. It also created a relationship between Truman and Roosevelt's aide [[Harry Hopkins]] and assured Truman's avid support for the New Deal.{{sfn|Savage|1991|p=65}}

=== U.S. Senator from Missouri ===
[[File:Senate Desk Truman.jpg|thumb|alt=Inside of wooden desk with several names carved into it|Drawer from the Senate desk used by Truman]]

After serving as a county judge, Truman wanted to run for Governor or Congress, but Pendergast rejected these ideas. Truman then thought he might serve out his career in some well-paying county sinecure; circumstances changed when Pendergast reluctantly backed him as the machine's choice in the 1934 Democratic [[primary election|primary]] for the [[1934 United States Senate election in Missouri|U.S. Senate from Missouri]], after Pendergast's first four choices had declined to run.{{sfn |United States Senate|2012}} In the primary, Truman defeated Congressmen [[John J. Cochran]] and [[Jacob L. Milligan]] with the solid support of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], which was crucial to his candidacy. Also critical were the contacts he had made statewide in his capacity as a county official, member of the Masons, military reservist, and member of the American Legion.{{sfn|Kirkendall|1989|p=27}} In the general election, Truman defeated incumbent Republican [[Roscoe C.

[[File:Missouri Senatorial Election Results by County, 1934.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Results of the 1934 U.S. Senate election in Missouri; Truman won the counties in blue]]

Truman assumed office with a reputation as "the Senator from Pendergast". He referred patronage decisions to Pendergast, but maintained that he voted with his own conscience. He later defended the patronage decisions by saying that "by offering a little to the machine, [he] saved a lot".{{sfn|Winn|2000}}{{sfn|''Time''|January 8, 1973}} In his first term, Truman spoke out against corporate greed and the dangers of [[Wall Street]] speculators and other moneyed special interests attaining too much influence in national affairs.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=232}} Though he served on the high-profile [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation#Committee on Interstate Commerce, 1887–1947|Interstate Commerce]] Committees, he was largely ignored by President Roosevelt and had trouble getting calls returned from the White House.{{sfn|Winn|2000}}{{sfn | McCullough |1992|p=230}}

During the [[1940 United States Senate election in Missouri|U.S. Senate election in 1940]], [[United States Attorney]] Maurice Milligan (former opponent Jacob Milligan's brother) and former governor [[Lloyd Stark]] both challenged Truman in the Democratic primary. Truman was politically weakened by Pendergast's imprisonment for income tax evasion the previous year; the senator had remained loyal, having claimed that Republican judges (not the Roosevelt administration) were responsible for the boss's downfall.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=11–12}} [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] party leader [[Robert E. Hannegan]]'s support of Truman proved crucial; he later brokered the deal that put Truman on the national ticket. In the end, Stark and Milligan split the anti-Pendergast vote in the Senate Democratic primary and Truman won by a total of 8,000&nbsp;votes. In the November election, Truman defeated Republican [[Manvel H. Davis]] by 51–49&nbsp;percent.{{sfn|Hamby|1995|pp=236–247}} As Senator, Truman opposed both Nazi Germany and Communist Russia. One week after [[Operation Barbarossa|Hitler invaded the Soviet Union]] in 1941, he said:

{{quote|If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia, and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible although I don't want to see Hitler victorious under any circumstances.<ref>{{cite book |last=Alexrod |first=Alan | title=The Real History of the Cold War: A New Look at the Past | publisher=Sterling |page=44}}</ref>}}

====Truman Committee====
{{Further|Truman Committee}}
In late 1940, Truman traveled to various military bases. The waste and profiteering he saw led him to use his chairmanship of the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services#Committee on Military Affairs, 1816–1947|Committee on Military Affairs]] Subcommittee on War Mobilization to start investigations into abuses while the nation prepared for war. A new special committee was set up under Truman to conduct a formal investigation; the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration|Roosevelt administration]] supported this plan rather than weather a more hostile probe by the House of Representatives. The main mission of the committee was to expose and fight waste and corruption in the gigantic government wartime contracts.

Truman's initiative convinced Senate leaders of the necessity for the committee, which reflected his demands for honest and efficient administration and his distrust of big business and Wall Street. Truman managed the committee "with extraordinary skill" and usually achieved consensus, generating heavy media publicity that gave him a national reputation.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael James Lacey|title=The Truman Presidency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hfkuktI-JewC&pg=PA35|year=1991|pages=35–36|isbn=9780521407731}}</ref>{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=12–14}} Activities of the Truman Committee ranged from criticizing the "[[dollar-a-year men]]" hired by the government, many of whom proved ineffective, to investigating a shoddily built New Jersey housing project for war workers.<ref>{{Citation | last = Herman | first = Arthur | title = Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II | pages = [https://archive.org/details/freedomsforgehow00herm/page/103 103, 118, 194, 198–199, 235–236, 275, 281, 303, 312] | publisher = Random House | place = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-1-4000-6964-4 | url = https://archive.org/details/freedomsforgehow00herm/page/103 }}.</ref>{{sfn |''Life''|November 30, 1942}}

Roosevelt's advisors knew that Roosevelt might not live out a fourth term, and that his vice president would very likely become the next president. [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]] had served as Roosevelt's vice president for four years and was popular among Democratic voters, but he was viewed as too far to the left and too friendly to labor for some of Roosevelt's advisers. The President and several of his confidantes wanted to replace Wallace with someone more acceptable to Democratic Party leaders. Outgoing Democratic National Committee chairman [[Frank C. Walker]], incoming chairman Hannegan, party treasurer [[Edwin W. Pauley]], Bronx party boss [[Edward J. Flynn|Ed Flynn]], [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[Edward Joseph Kelly]], and lobbyist George E. Allen all wanted to keep Wallace off the ticket.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=373–378}} Roosevelt told party leaders that he would accept either Truman or [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[William O. Douglas]].

State and city party leaders strongly preferred Truman, and Roosevelt agreed. Truman did not campaign for the vice-presidential spot, though he welcomed the attention as evidence that he had become more than the "Senator from Pendergast".{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=14–16}} Truman's nomination was dubbed the "Second [[Missouri Compromise]]" and was well received. The Roosevelt–Truman ticket achieved a 432–99&nbsp;[[United States Electoral College|electoral-vote]] victory in the election, defeating the Republican ticket of Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]] of New York and running mate Governor [[John Bricker]] of Ohio. Truman was sworn in as vice president on January 20, 1945.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=15–17}}

Truman's brief vice-presidency was relatively uneventful. On April 10, 1945,<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/VPTies.pdf Occasions When Vice Presidents Have Voted to Break Tie Votes in the Senate], [[Senate Historical Office]], [[United States Senate]], p. 7.</ref> Truman cast his only [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by Vice Presidents of the United States|tie-breaking vote]] as president of the Senate, against a [[Robert A.

Truman'' (Greenwood Press, 1980), p. 212: "On only one occasion did [Truman] break a tie, and this was when his negative vote defeated a Taft amendment to the Lend-Lease Act which would have prevented postwar delivery of lend-lease goods contracted for during the war."</ref><ref>[[Robert C.

The vote was tied, and Truman voted no, which, in a sense, was unnecessary since the bill would have died even without his vote."</ref> Roosevelt rarely contacted him, even to inform him of major decisions; the president and vice president met alone together only twice during their time in office.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|p=16}}

In one of his first acts as vice president, Truman created some controversy when he attended the disgraced Pendergast's funeral. He brushed aside the criticism, saying simply, "He was always my friend and I have always been his."{{sfn|Oshinsky|2004|pp=365–380}} He had rarely discussed world affairs or domestic politics with Roosevelt; he was uninformed about major initiatives relating to the war and the top-secret [[Manhattan Project]], which was about to test the world's first atomic bomb.{{sfn|U.S. History|2012}} In an event that generated negative publicity for Truman, he was photographed with actress [[Lauren Bacall]] sitting atop the piano at the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] as he played for soldiers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Schwab|first=Nick|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/08/13/lauren-bacall-and-harry-trumans-piano-moment-led-to-bigger-things|title=Lauren Bacall and Harry Truman's Piano Moment Led to Bigger Things|work=US News|date=August 13, 2014|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}</ref>

Truman had been vice president for 82&nbsp;days when President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945.{{sfn|U.S. History|2012}} Truman, presiding over the Senate as usual, had just adjourned the session for the day and was preparing to have a drink in [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Sam Rayburn]]'s office when he received an urgent message to go immediately to the White House, where [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] told him that her husband had died after a massive [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. Truman asked her if there was anything he could do for her; she replied, "Is there anything we can do for you? For you are the one in trouble now!"{{sfn|Truman Library|2012h}}{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=425}}{{sfn|Goodwin|1994|p=478}} He was sworn in as president at 7:09 pm in the West Wing of the White House, by Chief Justice [[Harlan F.

Truman surrounded himself with his old friends, and appointed several to high positions that seemed well beyond their competence, including his two secretaries of the treasury, [[Fred Vinson]] and [[John Wesley Snyder (US Cabinet Secretary)|John Snyder]]. His closest friend in the White House was his military aide [[Harry H. Vaughan]], who was criticized for trading access to the White House for expensive gifts.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p = 366}}{{sfn | Hamby |1995|pp=301–302, 472}} Truman loved to spend as much time as possible playing poker, telling stories and sipping bourbon. [[Alonzo Hamby]] notes that:

{{quote|... to many in the general public, gambling and bourbon swilling, however low-key, were not quite presidential. Neither was the intemperant "give 'em hell" campaign style nor the occasional profane phrase uttered in public. Poker exemplified a larger problem: the tension between his attempts at an image of leadership necessarily a cut above the ordinary and an informality that at times appeared to verge on crudeness.{{sfn | Hamby |1995|pp=474}}{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p = 511}}}}

=== First term (1945–1949) ===

==== Assuming office and the atomic bomb ====
{{details|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}}
[[File: Bundesarchiv Bild 183-29645-0001, Potsdamer Konferenz, Stalin, Truman, Churchill.jpg|thumb|alt=Three men in suits standing with several men in the background|[[Joseph Stalin]], Harry S. Truman, and [[Winston Churchill]] in Potsdam, July 1945]]

Shortly after taking the oath of office, Truman spoke to reporters: "Boys, if you ever pray, pray for me now. I don't know if you fellas ever had a load of hay fall on you, but when they told me what happened yesterday, I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me."{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p = 436}}

Upon assuming the presidency, Truman asked all the members of Roosevelt's cabinet to remain in place, and told them he was open to their advice. He emphasized a central principle of his administration: he would be the one making decisions, and they were to support him.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=348}} Although Truman was told briefly on the afternoon of April 12 that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] had a new, highly destructive weapon, it was not until April 25 that [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Stimson]] told him the details. Truman benefited from a honeymoon period after Roosevelt's death, and from the Allies' success in Europe, ending the war against Nazi Germany. Truman was pleased to issue the proclamation of [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]] on May 8, 1945, his 61st birthday.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=21–22}}{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=19–20}}

In the wake of Allied victory, Truman journeyed to Europe for the [[Potsdam Conference]]. He was there when he learned the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]]—the first atomic bomb—on July 16 had been successful. He hinted to [[Joseph Stalin]] that the United States was about to use a new kind of weapon against the Japanese. Though this was the first time the Soviets had been officially given information about the atomic bomb, Stalin was already aware of the bomb project—having learned about it through [[atomic spies|atomic espionage]] long before Truman did.{{sfn|PBS|2012}}{{sfn|Truman|1955|p=416}}{{sfn|McCoy|1984|p= 37}}

In August, the Japanese government refused surrender demands as specifically outlined in the [[Potsdam Declaration]]. With the [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]] imminent, Truman approved the schedule for dropping the two available bombs. Truman always said attacking Japan with atomic bombs saved many lives on both sides; military estimates for the invasion of Japan were that it could take a year and result in 250,000 to 500,000&nbsp;U.S. casualties. Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, and Nagasaki three days later, leaving 105,000&nbsp;dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/MED/med_chp10.shtml|title=Total Casualties – The Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|work=atomicarchive.com|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}</ref> The Soviet Union [[Soviet–Japanese War|declared war on Japan]] on August 9 and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invaded Manchuria]].

Truman continued to strongly defend himself in his memoirs in 1955–1956, stating many lives could have been lost had the United States invaded mainland Japan without the atomic bombs. In 1963, he stood by his decision, telling a journalist "it was done to save 125,000&nbsp;youngsters on the U.S. side and 125,000 on the Japanese side from getting killed and that is what it did. It probably also saved a half million youngsters on both sides from being maimed for life."<ref>{{cite book |title=Nuclear Weapons |page=11 |date=May 30, 2006 | first =William | last = Lambers |publisher=William K Lambers |isbn= 0-9724629-4-5}}</ref>

==== Strikes and economic upheaval ====
{{See also|Strike wave of 1946}}
The end of World War II was followed by an uneasy transition from war to a peacetime economy. The costs of the war effort had been enormous, and Truman was intent on diminishing military services as quickly as possible to curtail the government's military expenditures. The effect of demobilization on the economy was unknown, proposals were met with skepticism and resistance, and fears existed that the nation would slide back into depression. In Roosevelt's final years, Congress began to reassert legislative power and Truman faced a congressional body where Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed a powerful voting bloc.

Dormant stressors during the war emerged as polarizing issues under Truman's administration. Strikes and labor-management conflicts destabilized major industries while severe housing and consumer good shortages added to public stress over inflation which peaked at six percent in a single month.{{sfn |Miller Center| 2012}}

Truman's response to the widespread dissatisfaction and protest of U.S. citizens was generally seen as ineffective.{{sfn |Miller Center| 2012}} The cost of consumer goods increased rapidly due to the removal of depression-era limits on the prices of everyday items while producers of the remaining price-controlled commodities struggled due to the artificially low prices of their goods. In 1945 and 1946, farmers refused to sell grain for months even though it was desperately needed in the United States and to stave off starvation in Europe.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp= 54–55}} Similarly, industrial laborers sought wage increases. In January 1946 a steel strike involving 800,000&nbsp;laborers became the largest in the nation's history. It was followed by a coal strike in April and a rail strike in May; however, public opinion on labor action was mixed with one poll reporting a majority of the public in favor of a ban on strikes by public service workers and a year's moratorium on labor actions.

[[File:President Truman with Greek sponge divers..jpg|thumb|Truman with Greek-American sponge divers in Florida, 1947]]

When a national rail strike threatened in May 1946, Truman seized the railroads in an attempt to contain the issue, but two key railway unions struck anyway. The entire national railroad system was shut down, immobilizing 24,000&nbsp;freight trains and 175,000&nbsp;passenger trains a day.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/details/1946-05-23_Rail_Strike_Paralyzes_Entire_US|title=Rail Strike Paralyzes Entire U.S.|publisher=Universal Studios|date=May 23, 1946}}</ref> For two days, public anger mounted and Truman himself drafted an irate message to Congress that called on veterans to form a lynch mob and destroy the union leaders:

{{quote|Every single one of the strikers and their demagogue leaders have been living in luxury&nbsp;... Now I want you who are my comrades in arms&nbsp;... to come with me and eliminate the Lewises, the Whitneys, the Johnstons, the Communist Bridges [all important union officials] and the Russian Senators and Representatives&nbsp;... Let's put transportation and production back to work, hang a few traitors and make our own country safe for democracy.{{sfn |McCullough|1992| pp=498–501}}}}

His staff was stunned, but top aide [[Clark Clifford]] revised the original draft and Truman delivered a toned down version of the speech to Congress. Truman called for a new law, where any railroad strikers would be drafted into the army. As he concluded his congressional address, he received a message that the strike had been settled on presidential terms; nevertheless, a few hours later, the House voted to draft the strikers. Taft killed the bill in the Senate.{{sfn |McCullough|1992| pp=501–506}}<ref>{{cite book|author=Acacia, John|title=Clark Clifford: The Wise Man of Washington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63hJMGqu2YMC&pg=PT22|year=2009|page=22|isbn=978-0813139258}}</ref>

After the settlement of the railway strike, labor action continued as an undercurrent of Truman's presidency. The president's approval rating dropped from 82&nbsp;percent in the polls in January 1946 to 52&nbsp;percent by June.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=64–65}} This dissatisfaction with the Truman administration's policies led to large Democratic losses in the 1946 midterm elections, and Republicans took control of Congress for the first time since 1930. The [[80th United States Congress|80th Congress]] included Republican freshmen who would become prominent in U.S. politics in the years to come including Wisconsin Senator [[Joe McCarthy]] and California Congressman [[Richard Nixon]]. When Truman dropped to 32&nbsp;percent in the polls, Democratic Arkansas Senator [[William Fulbright]] suggested that Truman resign; the president said he did not care what Senator "Halfbright" said.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=48–50}}{{sfn|McCoy|1984|p=91}}

Truman cooperated closely with the Republican leaders on foreign policy, but fought them bitterly on domestic issues. The power of the labor unions was significantly curtailed by the [[Taft–Hartley Act]] which was enacted [[veto override|over Truman's veto]]. Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income tax rates in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his veto of a tax cut bill in 1948. In one notable instance of bipartisanship, Congress passed the [[Presidential Succession Act of 1947]], which replaced the secretary of state with the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate as successor to the president after the vice president.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=96–102}}

As he readied for the 1948 election, Truman made clear his identity as a Democrat in the [[New Deal]] tradition, advocating for [[national health insurance]],<ref>{{Citation | first = Howard | last = Markel | title = 'Give 'Em Health, Harry' | journal = Milbank Quarterly | year = 2015 | volume = 93 | number = 1 | pages = 1–7 | doi=10.1111/1468-0009.12096| pmid = 25752341 | pmc = 4364422 }}.</ref> and repeal of the Taft–Hartley Act. He broke with the New Deal by initiating an aggressive civil rights program which he termed a moral priority. His economic and social vision constituted a broad legislative agenda that came to be called the "[[Fair Deal]]."{{sfn |Dallek|2008| pp=84–86}} Truman's proposals were not well received by Congress, even with renewed Democratic majorities in Congress after 1948. The Solid South rejected civil rights as those states still enforced segregation. Only one of the major Fair Deal bills, the [[Housing Act of 1949]], was ever enacted.{{sfn |Binning|Esterly|Sracic|1999| p =417}}<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Charles M | last1 = Lamb | first2 = Adam W | last2 = Nye | title = Do Presidents Control Bureaucracy?

==== Marshall Plan, Cold War, and China ====
[[File: Charles Griffith Ross.jpg|thumb|Truman's press secretary was his old friend [[Charles Griffith Ross]]. He had great integrity but, says Alonzo L. Hamby, as a senior White House aide he was, "A better newsman than news handler, he never established a policy of coordinating news releases throughout the executive branch, frequently bumbled details, never developed&nbsp;... a strategy for marketing the president's image and failed to establish a strong press office."{{sfn | Hamby |1995|p=310}}]]

As a [[Wilsonian]] internationalist, Truman supported Roosevelt's policy in favor of the creation of the United Nations and included Eleanor Roosevelt on the delegation to the UN's first [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]].{{sfn|Roosevelt|1961}} With the Soviet Union expanding its sphere of influence through Eastern Europe, Truman and his foreign policy advisors took a hard line against the USSR. In this, he matched U.S. public opinion which quickly came to believe the Soviets were intent upon world domination.{{sfn | Dallek|2008|pp=56–57}}

Although he had little personal expertise on foreign matters, Truman listened closely to his top advisors, especially [[George Marshall]] and [[Dean Acheson]]. The Republicans controlled Congress in 1947–1948, so he worked with their leaders, especially Senator [[Arthur H. Vandenburg]], chairman of the powerful Foreign Relations Committee.<ref>James M. McCormick, and Eugene R. Wittkopf. "Bipartisanship, partisanship, and ideology in congressional-executive foreign policy relations, 1947–1988." ''Journal of Politics'' 52.4 (1990): 1077–1100.</ref> He won bipartisan support for both the [[Truman Doctrine]], which formalized a policy of Soviet containment, and the [[Marshall Plan]], which aimed to help rebuild postwar Europe.{{sfn | Freeland|1970|p=90}}{{sfn|Roberts|2000}}

To get Congress to spend the vast sums necessary to restart the moribund European economy, Truman used an ideological argument, arguing that communism flourishes in economically deprived areas.{{sfn| Holsti | 1996 | p=214}} As part of the U.S. [[Cold War]] strategy, Truman signed the [[National Security Act of 1947]] and reorganized military forces by merging the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] and the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] into the National Military Establishment (later the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]) and creating the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. The act also created the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]].{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=62–63}} In 1952, Truman secretly consolidated and empowered the cryptologic elements of the United States by creating the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA).

Truman did not know what to do about China, where the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] and [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] were fighting a large-scale [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]]. The Nationalists had been major wartime allies and had large-scale popular support in the United States, along with a powerful lobby. [[Marshall Mission|General George Marshall spent most of 1946 in China]] trying to negotiate a compromise, but failed. He convinced Truman the Nationalists would never win on their own and a very large-scale U.S. intervention to stop the Communists would significantly weaken U.S. opposition to the Soviets in Europe. By 1949, the Communists under [[Mao Zedong]] had won the civil war, the United States had a new enemy in Asia, and Truman came under fire from conservatives for [[Loss of China|"losing" China]].<ref>May, Ernest R.

==== Berlin airlift ====
{{details|Berlin Blockade}}
On June 24, 1948, the Soviet Union blocked access to the three [[Berlin Soviet Zone|Western-held sectors]] of Berlin. The Allies had not negotiated a deal to guarantee supply of the sectors deep within the Soviet-occupied zone. The commander of the U.S. occupation zone in Germany, General [[Lucius D. Clay]], proposed sending a large armored column across the Soviet zone to [[West Berlin]] with instructions to defend itself if it were stopped or attacked. Truman believed this would entail an unacceptable risk of war. He approved [[Ernest Bevin]]'s plan to supply the blockaded city by air.

On June 25, the Allies initiated the [[Berlin Airlift]], a campaign to deliver food, coal and other supplies using military aircraft on a massive scale. Nothing like it had ever been attempted before, and no single nation had the capability, either logistically or materially, to accomplish it. The airlift worked; ground access was again granted on May 11, 1949. Nevertheless, the airlift continued for several months after that. The Berlin Airlift was one of Truman's great foreign policy successes; it significantly aided his election campaign in 1948.{{sfn|Truman Library|1988a}}

==== Recognition of Israel ====

Truman had long taken an interest in the history of the Middle East, and was sympathetic to Jews who sought to re-establish their ancient homeland in [[Mandatory Palestine]]. As a senator, he announced support for [[Zionism]]; in 1943 he called for a homeland for those Jews who survived the Nazi regime. However, State Department officials were reluctant to offend the Arabs, who were opposed to the establishment of a Jewish state in the large region long populated and dominated culturally by Arabs. Secretary of Defense [[James Forrestal]] warned Truman of the importance of [[Saudi Arabia]]n oil in another war; Truman replied he would decide his policy on the basis of justice, not oil.{{sfn |McCullough|1992| pp=595–597}} U.S. diplomats with experience in the region were opposed, but Truman told them he had few Arabs among his constituents.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=599}}

Palestine was secondary to the goal of protecting the "Northern Tier" of Greece, Turkey, and Iran from communism, as promised by the Truman Doctrine.{{sfn|Ottolenghi|2004|pp=963–988}} Weary of both the convoluted politics of the Middle East and pressure by Jewish leaders, Truman was undecided on his policy, and skeptical about how the Jewish "underdogs" would handle power.<ref>Baylis, Thomas. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6T_Ff6Ra57sC&pg=PA55 How Israel was Won: A Concise History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict]'', p. 55 (Lexington Books, [[Rowman and Littlefield]], 1999).</ref><ref>Holmes, David.

Truman decided to recognize Israel over the objections of Secretary of State [[George Marshall]], who feared it would hurt relations with the populous Arab states. Marshall believed the paramount threat to the United States was the Soviet Union and feared Arab oil would be lost to the United States in the event of war; he warned Truman the United States was "playing with fire with nothing to put it out".{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=604–605}} Truman recognized the [[Israel|State of Israel]] on May 14, 1948, eleven minutes after [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|it declared itself a nation]].{{sfn|Lenczowski|1990|p=26}}{{sfn|Truman Library|1948}} Of his decision to recognize the Israeli state, Truman wrote in his [[memoirs]]: "Hitler had been murdering Jews right and left. I saw it, and I dream about it even to this day. The Jews needed some place where they could go. It is my attitude that the American government couldn't stand idly by while the victims [of] Hitler's madness are not allowed to build new lives."{{sfn|Berdichevsky|2012}}

=== 1948 election ===
{{details|1948 United States presidential election}}
[[File:Thomas E. Dewey 1948 campaign NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Dewey during a campaign tour in New York]]

The [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 presidential election]] is remembered for Truman's stunning come-from-behind victory.{{sfn|Hechler|Elsey|2006}} In the spring of 1948, Truman's public approval rating stood at 36&nbsp;percent,{{sfn|Burnes|2003|p=137}} and the president was nearly universally regarded as incapable of winning the general election. The "New Deal" operatives within the party—including FDR's son, [[James Roosevelt]]—tried to swing the Democratic nomination to General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], a highly popular figure whose political views and party affiliation were totally unknown. Eisenhower emphatically refused to accept, and Truman outflanked opponents to his own nomination.{{sfn|Hechler|Elsey|2006}}

At the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]], Truman attempted to unify the party with a vague civil rights plank in the party platform. His intention was to assuage the internal conflicts between the northern and southern wings of his party. Events overtook his efforts. A sharp address given by Mayor [[Hubert Humphrey]] of [[Minneapolis]]—as well as the local political interests of a number of urban bosses—convinced the convention to adopt a stronger civil rights plank, which Truman approved wholeheartedly. All of Alabama's delegates, and a portion of Mississippi's, walked out of the convention in protest.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=640}} Unfazed, Truman delivered an aggressive acceptance speech attacking the 80th Congress, which Truman called the "Do Nothing Congress,"{{sfn|Miller Center|2012}} and promising to win the election and "make these Republicans like it."{{sfn|Hamby|2008}}

Within two weeks of the 1948 convention Truman issued [[Executive Order 9981]], racially [[Racial integration|integrating]] the U.S. Armed Services{{sfn|Center of Military History|2012}}{{sfn|''Federal Register''|1948}}{{sfn|Truman Library|1998}} and Executive Order 9980 to integrate federal agencies. Truman took a considerable political risk in backing civil rights, and many seasoned Democrats were concerned the loss of [[Dixiecrat]] support might destroy the Democratic Party. South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]], a segregationist, declared his candidacy for the presidency on a Dixiecrat ticket and led a full-scale revolt of Southern "[[states' rights]]" proponents. This rebellion on the right was matched by one on the left, led by Wallace on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] ticket. Immediately after its first post-FDR convention, the Democratic Party seemed to be disintegrating. Victory in November seemed unlikely as the party was not simply split but divided three ways.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=153–158}} For his running mate, Truman accepted Kentucky Senator [[Alben W. Barkley]], though he really wanted Justice [[William O. Douglas]], who turned down the nomination.{{sfn|Pietrusza|2011|pp=226–232}}

Truman's political advisors described the political scene as "one unholy, confusing cacophony." They told Truman to speak directly to the people, in a personal way.<ref>{{cite web|title=Footnotes on Political Battles of 1948|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/1948campaign/large/docs/documents/index.php?pagenumber=1&documentdate=1948-00-00&documentid=6-13&studycollectionid=Election|website=Truman's Library|publisher=Truman's Library|accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref> Campaign manager William J.

The campaign was a {{convert|21928|mi|km|adj=on}} presidential odyssey.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=654}} In a personal appeal to the nation, Truman crisscrossed the United States by train; his "[[whistle stop train tour|whistle stop]]" speeches from the rear platform of the observation car, ''[[Ferdinand Magellan Railcar|Ferdinand Magellan]],'' came to represent his campaign. His combative appearances captured the popular imagination and drew huge crowds. Six stops in [[Michigan]] drew a combined half-million people;{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=657}} a full million turned out for a New York City ticker-tape parade.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=701}}

The large, mostly spontaneous gatherings at Truman's whistle-stop events were an important sign of a change in momentum in the campaign, but this shift went virtually unnoticed by the national press corps. It continued reporting Republican [[Thomas Dewey]]'s apparent impending victory as a certainty. One reason for the press's inaccurate projection was that polls were conducted primarily by telephone, but many people, including much of Truman's populist base, did not yet own a telephone.{{sfn|Curran|Takata|2002}} This skewed the data to indicate a stronger support base for Dewey than existed. An unintended and undetected projection error may have contributed to the perception of Truman's bleak chances. The three major polling organizations stopped polling well before the November 2 election date—[[Elmo Roper|Roper]] in September, and Crossley and [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] in October—thus failing to measure the period when Truman appears to have surged past Dewey.{{sfn|Bennett|2012}}{{sfn|Truman Library|1971}}

In the end, Truman held his progressive Midwestern base, won most of the Southern states despite the civil rights plank, and squeaked through with narrow victories in a few critical states, notably Ohio, California, and Illinois. The final tally showed the president had secured 303&nbsp;electoral votes, Dewey&nbsp;189, and Thurmond only 39. Henry Wallace got none. The defining image of the campaign came after Election Day, when an ecstatic Truman held aloft the erroneous front page of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' with a huge headline proclaiming "[[Dewey Defeats Truman]]."{{sfn|Jones|1948}}

==== Hydrogen bomb decision ====
The Soviet Union's [[Soviet atomic bomb project|atomic bomb project]] progressed much faster than had been expected,{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=747–749}} and they detonated [[RDS-1|their first bomb]] on August 29, 1949. Over the next several months there was an intense debate that split U.S. government, military, and scientific communities regarding whether to proceed with development of the far more powerful [[hydrogen bomb]].{{sfn|Young|Schilling|2019|pp=1–2}} The debate touched on matters from technical feasibility to strategic value to the morality of creating a massively destructive weapon.{{sfn|Young|Schilling|2019|pp=152–159}}{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=756–758}} On January 31, 1950, Truman made the decision to go forward on the grounds that if the Soviets could make an H-bomb, the United States must do so as well and stay ahead in the nuclear arms race.{{sfn|Young|Schilling|2019|p=165}}{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=762–764}} The development achieved fruition with the [[Ivy Mike|first U.S. H-bomb test]] on October 31, 1952, which was officially announced by Truman on January 7, 1953.{{sfn|Atomic Archive|1953}}

==== Korean War ====
{{details|Korean War}}
[[File:Truman initiating Korean involvement.jpg|thumb|President Truman signing a proclamation declaring a national emergency and authorizing U.S. entry into the Korean War]]

On June 25, 1950, the [[Korean People's Army|North Korean army]] under [[Kim Il-sung]] invaded South Korea, starting the [[Korean War]]. In the early weeks of the war, the North Koreans easily pushed back their southern counterparts.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=222–27}} Truman called for a naval blockade of Korea, only to learn that due to budget cutbacks, the U.S. Navy could not enforce such a measure.{{sfn|Truman Library, Memo|1950}} Truman promptly urged the United Nations to intervene; it did, authorizing troops under the UN flag led by U.S. General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. Truman decided he did not need formal authorization from Congress, believing that most legislators supported his position; this would come back to haunt him later, when the stalemated conflict was dubbed "Mr. Truman's War" by legislators.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=222–27}}

However, on July 3, 1950, Truman did give Senate Majority Leader [[Scott W. Lucas]] a draft resolution titled "Joint Resolution Expressing Approval of the Action Taken in Korea". Lucas stated Congress supported the use of force, the formal resolution would pass but was unnecessary, and consensus in Congress was to acquiesce. Truman responded he did not want "to appear to be trying to get around Congress and use extra-Constitutional powers," and added that it was "up to Congress whether such a resolution should be introduced."<ref>{{Citation | author-link = John Dean| last = Dean | first = John | title = Broken Government: How Republican Rule Destroyed the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Branches | pages = 257, 315 | publisher = Penguin | year = 2007}}.</ref>

By August 1950, U.S. troops pouring into South Korea under UN auspices were able to stabilize the situation.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|p=107}} Responding to criticism over readiness, Truman fired his secretary of defense, [[Louis A. Johnson]], replacing him with the retired General Marshall. With UN approval, Truman decided on a "rollback" policy—conquest of North Korea.{{sfn|Matray|1979|pp=314–333}} UN forces led by General [[Douglas MacArthur]] led the counterattack, scoring a stunning surprise victory with an amphibious landing at the [[Battle of Inchon]] that nearly trapped the invaders. UN forces marched north, toward the [[Yalu River]] boundary with China, with the goal of reuniting Korea under UN auspices.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=81–90}}

However, China surprised the UN forces with a large-scale invasion in November. The UN forces were forced back to below the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], then recovered.{{sfn|Cohen|Gooch|2006|pp=165–195}} By early 1951 the war became a fierce stalemate at about the 38th parallel where it had begun. Truman rejected MacArthur's request to attack Chinese supply bases north of the Yalu, but MacArthur promoted his plan to Republican house leader [[Joseph William Martin Jr.|Joseph Martin]], who leaked it to the press. Truman was gravely concerned further escalation of the war might lead to open conflict with the Soviet Union, which was already supplying weapons and providing warplanes (with Korean markings and Soviet aircrew). Therefore, on April 11, 1951, Truman fired MacArthur from his commands.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=123–129}}

The [[President Truman's relief of General Douglas MacArthur|dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur]] was among the least politically popular decisions in presidential history. Truman's approval ratings plummeted, and he faced calls for his [[impeachment]] from, among others, Senator [[Robert A. Taft]].{{sfn |Strout|1999}} Fierce criticism from virtually all quarters accused Truman of refusing to shoulder the blame for a war gone sour and blaming his generals instead. Others, including Eleanor Roosevelt, supported and applauded Truman's decision. MacArthur meanwhile returned to the United States to a hero's welcome, and addressed a joint session of Congress, a speech the president called "a bunch of damn bullshit."{{sfn|Weintraub|2000}}

Truman and his generals considered the use of nuclear weapons against the Chinese army, but ultimately chose not to escalate the war to a nuclear level.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/how-korean-war-almost-went-nuclear-180955324/ |title=How the Korean War Almost Went Nuclear}}</ref> The war remained a frustrating stalemate for two years, with over 30,000&nbsp;Americans killed, until an armistice ended the fighting in 1953.{{sfn|Chambers II|1999|p=849}} In February 1952, Truman's approval mark stood at 22&nbsp;percent according to [[Gallup poll]]s, which is the all-time lowest approval mark for an active U.S. president, though it was matched by Richard Nixon in 1974.{{sfn|Roper|2010}}<ref name="presidency.ucsb.edu">[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/popularity.php?pres=37 Presidential Job Approval for Richard Nixon] at the American Presidency Project.</ref>

The escalation of the Cold War was highlighted by Truman's approval of [[NSC 68]], a secret statement of foreign policy. It called for tripling the defense budget, and the globalization and militarization of containment policy whereby the United States and its NATO allies would respond militarily to actual Soviet expansion. The document was drafted by [[Paul Nitze]], who consulted State and Defense officials, and was formally approved by President Truman as official national strategy after the war began in Korea. It called for partial mobilization of the U.S. economy to build armaments faster than the Soviets. The plan called for strengthening Europe, weakening the Soviet Union, and building up the United States both militarily and economically.{{sfn|Wells|1979|pp=116–158}}

Truman was a strong supporter of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), which established a formal peacetime military alliance with Canada and democratic European nations not under Soviet control following World War II. The treaty establishing it was widely popular and easily passed the Senate in 1949; Truman appointed General Eisenhower as commander. NATO's goals were to contain Soviet expansion in Europe and to send a clear message to communist leaders that the world's democracies were willing and able to build new security structures in support of democratic ideals. The United States, Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, and Canada were the original treaty signatories. The alliance resulted in the Soviets establishing a similar alliance, called the [[Warsaw Pact]].{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=197–199, 232}}{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=89–91}}

General Marshall was Truman's principal adviser on foreign policy matters, influencing such decisions as the U.S. choice against offering direct military aid to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his nationalist Chinese forces in the [[Chinese Civil War]] against their communist opponents. Marshall's opinion was contrary to the counsel of almost all of Truman's other advisers—Marshall thought propping up Chiang's forces would drain U.S. resources necessary for Europe to deter the Soviets.{{sfn |May|2002|pp=1001–1010}} When the communists took control of the mainland, establishing the [[People's Republic of China]] and driving the nationalists to [[Taiwan]], Truman would have been willing to maintain some relationship between the United States and the new government but Mao was unwilling.{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|pp=217–218, 224}} Truman announced on January 5, 1950, that the United States would not engage in any dispute involving the Taiwan Strait, and that he would not intervene in the event of an attack by the PRC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry S Truman, "Statement on Formosa," January 5, 1950|url=http://china.usc.edu/harry-s-truman-%E2%80%9Cstatement-formosa%E2%80%9D-january-5-1950|publisher=[[University of Southern California]]|accessdate=April 2, 2019}}</ref>

On June 27, 1950, after the outbreak of fighting in Korea, Truman ordered the U.S. Navy's [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] into the [[Taiwan Strait]] to prevent further conflict between the communist government on the China mainland and the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on Taiwan.{{sfn|Donovan|1983|pp=198–199}}<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/colloquia/cch3c.htm |title = The Seventh Fleet in Chinese Waters |author = Marolda, Edward J. |accessdate = December 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140526013317/http://www.history.navy.mil/colloquia/cch3c.htm |archivedate = May 26, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Truman usually worked well with his top staff—the exceptions were Israel in 1948 and Spain 1945–1950. Truman was a very strong opponent of [[Francisco Franco]], the right-wing dictator of Spain. He withdrew the American ambassador (but diplomatic relations were not formally broken), kept Spain out of the UN, and rejected any Marshall Plan financial aid to Spain. However, as the Cold War escalated, support for Spain was strong in Congress, the Pentagon, the business community and other influential elements especially Catholics and cotton growers.

Liberal opposition to Spain had faded after the Wallace element broke with the Democratic Party in 1948; the CIO became passive on the issue. As Secretary of State Acheson increased his pressure on Truman, the president, stood alone in his administration as his own top appointees wanted to normalize relations. When China entered the Korean War and pushed American forces back, the argument for allies became irresistible. Admitting he was "overruled and worn down," Truman relented and sent an ambassador and made loans available.<ref>Mark S. Byrnes,"'Overruled and Worn Down': Truman Sends an Ambassador to Spain." ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 29.2 (1999): 263–279.</ref>

==== Soviet espionage and McCarthyism ====
In August 1948, [[Whittaker Chambers]], a former spy for the Soviets and a senior editor at ''Time'' magazine, testified before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). He said an underground communist network had worked inside the U.S. government during the 1930s, of which Chambers had been a member, along with [[Alger Hiss]], until recently a senior State Department official. Chambers did not allege any spying during the Truman presidency. Although Hiss denied the allegations, he was convicted in January 1950 for perjury for denials under oath.

The Soviet Union's success in exploding an atomic weapon in 1949 and the fall of the nationalist Chinese the same year led many Americans to conclude subversion by Soviet spies was responsible, and to demand that communists be rooted out from the government and other places of influence.{{sfn |Dallek|2008| pp =87–88}}{{sfn|McCoy|1984| pp =194, 217–218}} However, Truman got himself into deeper trouble when he called the Hiss trial a "red herring".<ref>{{cite book|last=Kirkendall|first=Richard S.|title=The Civil Liberties Legacy of Harry S.

Charges that Soviet agents had infiltrated the government were believed by 78&nbsp;percent of the people in 1946, and became a major campaign issue for Eisenhower in 1952.{{sfn|Troy|2008|p=128}} Truman was reluctant to take a more radical stance because he feared full disclosure of the extent of communist infiltration would reflect badly on the Democratic Party. In 1949, Truman described American communist leaders, whom his administration [[Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders|was prosecuting]], as "traitors", but in 1950 he vetoed the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]]. It was passed over his veto.{{sfn |McCoy|1984| pp =216–217, 234–235}} Truman would later state in private conversations with friends that his creation of a loyalty program had been a "terrible" mistake.{{sfn|McCullough| 1992 |p= 553}}

[[File:White-house-1950-interior-shell.jpg|thumb|alt=Inside of a building being renovated, with scaffolding|View of the interior shell of the White House during renovation in 1950]]

In 1948, Truman ordered an addition to the exterior of the [[White House]]: a second-floor balcony in the south portico, which came to be known as the ''[[Truman Balcony]]''. The addition was unpopular. Some said it spoiled the appearance of the south facade, but it gave the First Family more living space.{{sfn|White House Museum|1952}}{{sfn|Truman Library, Balcony|2012}} {{sfn|Truman Library, Balcony II|2012}} The Truman family moved into nearby [[Blair House]] during the renovations.

{{external media|align=center|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wGYoU50uks Newsreel scenes in English of the assassination attempt on U.S. President Harry S. Truman]}}
On November 1, 1950, [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] nationalists [[Griselio Torresola]] and [[Oscar Collazo]] attempted to assassinate Truman at Blair House. On the street outside the residence, Torresola mortally wounded a White House policeman, [[Leslie Coffelt]]. Before he died, the officer shot and killed Torresola. Collazo was wounded and stopped before he entered the house. He was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in 1952. Truman commuted his sentence to life in prison. To try to settle the question of Puerto Rican independence, Truman allowed a [[1952 Puerto Rican constitutional referendum|plebiscite in Puerto Rico in 1952]] to determine the status of its relationship to the United States. Nearly 82&nbsp;percent of the people voted in favor of a new constitution for the ''[[Estado Libre Asociado]],'' a continued 'associated free state.'<ref name= N1>{{Citation | author-link = Dieter Nohlen| last = Nohlen | first = Dieter | year = 2005 | title = Elections in the Americas: A Data Handbook | volume = I | page = 556 | isbn = 978-0-19-928357-6}}.</ref>

==== Steel and coal strikes ====
{{details|1952 steel strike}}
In response to a labor/management impasse arising from bitter disagreements over wage and price controls, Truman instructed his [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]], [[Charles W. Sawyer]], to take control of a number of the nation's steel mills in April 1952. Truman cited his authority as Commander in Chief and the need to maintain an uninterrupted supply of steel for munitions for the war in Korea. The Supreme Court found Truman's actions unconstitutional, however, and reversed the order in a major [[separation of powers|separation-of-powers]] decision, ''[[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'' (1952). The 6–3&nbsp;decision, which held that Truman's assertion of authority was too vague and was not rooted in any legislative action by Congress, was delivered by a Court composed entirely of Justices appointed by either Truman or Roosevelt. The high court's reversal of Truman's order was one of the notable defeats of his presidency.{{sfn|Higgs|2004}}

==== Scandals and controversies ====
[[File:Harry S Truman - NARA - 530677 (2).jpg|thumb|Truman in an official portrait]]

In 1950, the Senate, led by [[Estes Kefauver]], investigated numerous charges of corruption among senior administration officials, some of whom received fur coats and deep freezers in exchange for favors. A large number of employees of the [[Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Bureau]] (today the IRS) were accepting bribes; 166&nbsp;employees either resigned or were fired in 1950,{{sfn|Smaltz|1998}} with many soon facing indictment. When Attorney General [[J. Howard McGrath]] fired the special prosecutor in early 1952 for being too zealous, Truman fired McGrath.{{sfn|Smaltz|1996}} Truman submitted a reorganization plan to reform the IRB; Congress passed it, but the corruption was a major issue in the 1952 presidential election.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|p=299}}{{sfn|Donovan|1983|pp=116–117}}

On December 6, 1950, ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' music critic [[Paul Hume]] wrote a critical review of a concert by the president's daughter Margaret Truman:

{{quote|Miss Truman is a unique American phenomenon with a pleasant voice of little size and fair quality&nbsp;... [she] cannot sing very well&nbsp;... is flat a good deal of the time—more last night than at any time we have heard her in past years&nbsp;... has not improved in the years we have heard her&nbsp;... [and] still cannot sing with anything approaching professional finish.{{sfn|Truman Library, FAQ|1950}}}}

Truman wrote a scathing response:

{{quote|I've just read your lousy review of Margaret's concert. I've come to the conclusion that you are an 'eight ulcer man on four ulcer pay.' It seems to me that you are a frustrated old man who wishes he could have been successful. When you write such poppy-cock as was in the back section of the paper you work for it shows conclusively that you're off the beam and at least four of your ulcers are at work. Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you'll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter below! [[Westbrook Pegler|Pegler]], a gutter snipe, is a gentleman alongside you. I hope you'll accept that statement as a worse insult than a reflection on your ancestry.{{sfn|Truman Library, FAQ|1950}}}}

Truman was criticized by many for the letter. However, he pointed out that he wrote it as a loving father and not as the president.{{sfn|Barnes|2008}}{{sfn|Giglio|2001|p=112}}{{sfn|Smith|2001}}

In 1951, [[William M. Boyle]], Truman's longtime friend and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was forced to resign after being charged with financial corruption.<ref>Eleonora W. Schoenebaum, ed. ''Political Profiles: The Truman Years'' (1978) pp. 48–49.</ref>

=== Civil rights ===
{{further|President's Committee on Civil Rights}}
A 1947 report by the Truman administration titled ''To Secure These Rights'' presented a detailed ten-point agenda of civil rights reforms. Speaking about this report, international developments have to be taken into account, for with the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]] being passed in 1945, the question whether international [[human rights]] law could be applicable also on an inner-land basis became crucial in the United States. Though the report acknowledged such a path was not free from controversy in the 1940s United States, it nevertheless raised the possibility for the UN-Charter to be used as a legal tool to combat racial discrimination in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geschichte-menschenrechte.de/schluesseltexte/william-h-fitzpatricks-editorials-on-human-rights-1949/ |title=William H. Fitzpatrick's Editorials on Human Rights (1949) |author=Christopher N.J.Roberts |publisher=Quellen zur Geschichte der Menschenrechte |accessdate=November 4, 2017 }}</ref>

In February 1948, the president submitted a civil rights agenda to Congress that proposed creating several federal offices devoted to issues such as [[voting rights]] and [[employment discrimination|fair employment]] practices.{{sfn |Truman Library, Special Message|1948}} This provoked a storm of criticism from southern Democrats in the runup to the national nominating convention, but Truman refused to compromise, saying: "My forebears were Confederates&nbsp;... but my very stomach turned over when I had learned that Negro soldiers, just back from overseas, were being dumped out of Army trucks in Mississippi and beaten."{{sfn |Truman|1973| p=429}}

Tales of the abuse, violence, and persecution suffered by many African-American veterans upon their return from World War II infuriated Truman, and were a major factor in his decision to issue [[Executive Order 9981]], in July 1948, requiring equal opportunity in the armed forces.{{sfn|Kirkendall|1989|pp=10–11}} In the early 1950s after several years of planning, recommendations and revisions between Truman, the [[President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity|Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity]] and the various branches of the military, the services became racially integrated.{{sfn|MacGregor|1981|pp=312–315, 376–378, 457–459}}

Executive Order 9980, also in 1948, made it illegal to discriminate against persons applying for civil service positions based on race. A third, in 1951, established the [[Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs|Committee on Government Contract Compliance]] (CGCC). This committee ensured defense contractors did not discriminate because of race.{{sfn|National Archives|1948}}{{sfn|National Archives|1953}} In 1950 he vetoed the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]]. It was passed over his veto.{{sfn |McCoy|1984| pp =216–217, 234–235}}

In 1951, the United States ratified the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]], making a president ineligible for election to a third term or for election to a second full term after serving more than two remaining years of a term of a previously elected president. The latter clause did not apply to Truman's situation in 1952 because of a [[grandfather clause]] excluding the amendment's application to the incumbent president.{{sfn|Find Law|2012}}

Therefore, he seriously considered running for another term in 1952, and left his name on the ballot in the New Hampshire primary. However all his close advisors, pointing to his age, his failing abilities, and his poor showing in the polls, talked him out of it.<ref>Alonzo L. Hamby. ''Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman'' (1995), pp. 602–605.</ref> At the time of the 1952 New Hampshire primary, no candidate had won Truman's backing. His first choice, Chief Justice [[Fred M.

Truman had hoped to recruit [[General Eisenhower]] as a Democratic candidate, but found him more interested in seeking the Republican nomination. Accordingly, Truman let his name be entered in the [[New Hampshire primary]] by supporters. The highly unpopular Truman was handily defeated by Kefauver; 18&nbsp;days later the president formally announced he would not seek a second full term. Truman was eventually able to persuade Stevenson to run, and the governor gained the nomination at the [[1952 Democratic National Convention]].{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=139–142}}

Eisenhower gained the Republican nomination, with Senator Nixon as his running mate, and campaigned against what he denounced as Truman's failures: "Korea, communism and corruption". He pledged to clean up the "mess in Washington," and promised to "go to Korea."{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=887}}{{sfn|Ambrose|1983|p=515}} Eisenhower defeated Stevenson decisively in the [[1952 United States presidential election|general election]], ending 20&nbsp;years of Democratic presidents.

Upon leaving the presidency, Truman returned to Independence, Missouri, to live at the [[Harry S. Truman National Historic Site|Wallace home]] he and Bess had shared for years with her mother.{{sfn|Truman Library|2012i}} He taught occasional courses at universities, including [[Yale University|Yale]], where he was a [[Chubb Fellowship|Chubb Fellow]] visiting lecturer in 1958.<ref>Robert H.

He also turned down numerous offers for commercial endorsements. Since his earlier business ventures had proved unsuccessful, he had no personal savings.

As a result, he faced financial challenges. Once Truman left the White House, his only income was his old army pension: $112.56 per month ({{Inflation|US|112.56|1953|fmt=eq}}).{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=1099}} Former members of Congress and the federal courts received a federal retirement package; President Truman himself ensured that former servants of the executive branch of government received similar support. In 1953, however, there was no such benefit package for former presidents, and he received no pension for his Senate service.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|p=150}}

Truman had taken out a personal loan from a Washington bank shortly before leaving office.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=928}} He then found a potentially lucrative book deal for his memoirs. The writing was a struggle for Truman and he went through a dozen collaborators during the project,{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=936–938, 945–947}} not all of whom served him well,{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=385}} but he remained heavily involved in the end result.{{sfn|Young|Schilling|2019|p=168n5}} For the memoirs, Truman received a flat payment of $670,000, and had to pay two-thirds of that in tax; he calculated he got $37,000 after he paid his assistants.{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=387}} However, the memoirs were a commercial and critical success.{{sfn|''Time''|August 13, 1956}}<ref name="nevins" /> They were published in two volumes: ''Memoirs by Harry S.

The former president told House Majority Leader [[John William McCormack|John McCormack]] in 1957, "Had it not been for the fact that I was able to sell some property that my brother, sister, and I inherited from our mother, I would practically be on relief, but with the sale of that property I am not financially embarrassed."{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=963}} The following year, Congress passed the [[Former Presidents Act]], offering a $25,000 yearly pension to each former president, and it is likely that Truman's financial status played a role in the law's enactment.{{sfn|Smith|2008}} The only other living former president at the time, [[Herbert Hoover]], also took the pension, even though he did not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing Truman.{{sfn|Martin|1960|p=249}}

===Truman Library===
{{see also|Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum}}
Truman's predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had organized his own [[presidential library]], but legislation to enable future presidents to do something similar had not been enacted. Truman worked to garner private donations to build a presidential library, which he donated to the federal government to maintain and operate—a practice adopted by his successors.{{sfn|Burnes|2003|pp=217–218}}

He testified before Congress to have money appropriated to have presidential papers copied and organized, and was proud of the bill's passage in 1957. Max Skidmore, in his book on the life of former presidents, noted that Truman was a well-read man, especially in history. Skidmore added that the presidential papers legislation and the founding of his library "was the culmination of his interest in history. Together they constitute an enormous contribution to the United States—one of the greatest of any former president."{{sfn|Skidmore|2004|pp=123–124}}

===Politics===
Truman supported Adlai Stevenson's second bid for the White House in 1956, although he had initially favored Democratic Governor [[W. Averell Harriman]] of New York.{{sfn|Ohio State|2012}} He continued to campaign for Democratic senatorial candidates for many years.{{sfn|Truman Library|1965}} 

In 1960 Truman gave a public statement announcing he would not attend the [[1960 Democratic National Convention|Democratic Convention]] that year, citing concerns about the way that the supporters of [[John F. Kennedy]] had gained control of the nominating process, and called on Kennedy to forgo the nomination for that year.<ref name= "Truman 1960">President Truman, {{YouTube|y49FJYbjA4I|Truman Criticism of JFK}}, Press Conference / July 2nd, 1960.</ref> Kennedy responded with a press conference where he bluntly rebuked Truman's advice.<ref name= "Kennedy 1960">Senator John F. Kennedy, {{YouTube|2B5WmdWGJco|Kennedy Responds to Truman}}, Press Conference / July 4th, 1960.</ref>

Upon turning 80 in 1964, Truman was feted in Washington, and addressed the Senate, availing himself of a new rule that allowed former presidents to be granted [[Floor privileges of the United States Senate|privilege of the floor]].{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=983}}

===Critique of the CIA===
In late 1963, when Lyndon B. Johnson had just become president, Truman wrote an [[Op-ed]] in the ''Washington Post'' calling for the responsibilities of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) to be scaled back significantly: "I never had any thought when I set up the CIA that it would be injected into peacetime cloak and dagger operations."<ref>Monte Reel, "A Brotherhood of Spies: The U2 and the CIA's Secret War," (New York: Anchor Books, 2019), p. 289</ref>  "For some time I have been disturbed by the way the CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas."<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/LimitCIARoleToIntelligenceByHarrySTruman/Limit%20CIA%20Role%20To%20Intelligence%20by%20Harry%20S%20Truman_djvu.txt Limit CIA Role To Intelligence by Harry S Truman], ''The Washington Post'',
December 22, 1963</ref> He called for scrapping [[Directorate of Operations (CIA) | paramilitary actions]], such as the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], and [[United States involvement in regime change | interventions]] into the internal politics of other countries. The CIA had shifted from defending freedom to destroying it, Truman suggested.<ref>Monte Reel, "A Brotherhood of Spies: The U2 and the CIA's Secret War," (New York: Anchor Books, 2019), p. 289</ref>

===Medicare===
After a fall in his home in late 1964, his physical condition declined. In 1965, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] bill at the [[Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum]] and gave the first two Medicare cards to Truman and his wife Bess to honor the former president's fight for government health care while in office.{{sfn|Truman Library|1965}}

== Death ==
[[File:TrumanFuneralWreath.jpg|thumb|Wreath by Truman's casket, December 27, 1972]]

On December 5, 1972, Truman was admitted to Kansas City's [[Research Medical Center|Research Hospital and Medical Center]] with pneumonia. He developed multiple organ failure, fell into a coma, and died at 7:50&nbsp;a.m. on December 26, at the age of 88.<ref name=CBSRadioNews1972>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ej-jLWxg-4|title=6:00 p.m.|publisher=CBS|work=CBS Radio News|access-date=December 27, 2017|date=December 25, 1972|via=YouTube}}</ref>{{sfn|Truman Library|2012i}}

Bess Truman opted for a simple private service at the library rather than a state funeral in Washington. A week after the funeral, foreign dignitaries and Washington officials attended a memorial service at [[Washington National Cathedral]].

Bess died in 1982 and is buried next to Harry at the [[Harry S. Truman Library and Museum]] in Independence, Missouri.{{sfn|Washington National Cathedral|2012}}{{sfn|Wooten|1973|p=1}}

== Tributes and legacy ==

Biographer Robert Donovan has tried to capture Truman's personality:

{{quote|text=Vigorous, hard-working, simple, he had grown up close to the soil of the Midwest and understood the struggles of the people on the farms and in the small towns. ... After 10 years in the Senate, he had risen above the Pendergast organization. Still, he ''had'' come from a world of two-bit politicians, and its aura was one that he never was able to shed entirely. And he ''did'' retain certain characteristics one often sees in machine-bred politicians: intense partisanship, stubborn loyalty, a certain insensitivity about the transgressions of political associates, and a disinclination for the companionship of intellectuals and artists.<ref>{{cite book|author=Donovan, Robert J.|authorlink=Robert J.

Citing continuing divisions within the Democratic Party, the ongoing Cold War, and the [[boom and bust]] cycle, journalist Samuel Lubell in 1952 stated: "After seven years of Truman's hectic, even furious, activity the nation seemed to be about on the same general spot as when he first came to office&nbsp;... Nowhere in the whole Truman record can one point to a single, decisive break-through&nbsp;... All his skills and energies—and he was among our hardest-working Presidents—were directed to standing still."<ref name="lubell1956">{{cite book | title=The Future of American Politics | publisher=Anchor Press | last = Lubell | first = Samuel | year = 1956 | pages = 9–10 | edition = 2nd|ol = 6193934M}}</ref> When he left office in 1953, Truman was one of the most unpopular chief executives in history. His job approval rating of 22% in the Gallup Poll of February 1952 was lower than Richard Nixon's 24% in August 1974, the month Nixon resigned, but matched by Nixon's all-time low in January 1974.<ref name="presidency.ucsb.edu"/>

U.S. public feeling towards Truman grew steadily warmer with the passing years; as early as 1962, a poll of 75 historians conducted by [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr.]] ranked Truman among the "near great" presidents. The period following his death consolidated a partial rehabilitation of his legacy among both historians and members of the public.{{sfn|''Wisconsin Magazine of History''|Autumn 1975}} Truman died when the nation was consumed with crises in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]], and his death brought a new wave of attention to his political career.{{sfn|''Time''|December 3, 1973}} In the early and mid-1970s, Truman captured the popular imagination much as he had in 1948, this time emerging as a kind of political [[folk hero]], a president who was thought to exemplify an integrity and accountability which many observers felt was lacking in [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|the Nixon White House]]. This public reassessment of Truman was aided by the popularity of a book of reminiscences Truman had recounted to journalist [[Merle Miller]] beginning in 1961, with the agreement that they would not be published until after Truman's death.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=149, 152}}

Truman has had his latter-day critics as well. After a review of information available to Truman about the presence of espionage activities in the U.S. government, Democratic Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] concluded that Truman was "almost wilfully obtuse" concerning the danger of [[American Left#Marxist|U.S. communism]].{{sfn|Moynihan|1997}} In 2010, historian Alonzo Hamby concluded that "Harry Truman remains a controversial president."{{sfn|Hamby|2002}} However, since leaving office, Truman has fared well in [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|polls ranking the presidents]]. He has never been listed lower than ninth, and was ranked fifth in a [[C-SPAN]] poll in 2009.{{sfn|CSPAN|2009}}
{{external media| float = right| width = 210px | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?27217-1/truman ''Booknotes'' interview with David McCullough on ''Truman'', July 19, 1992], [[C-SPAN]]}}

The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 caused Truman advocates to claim vindication for his decisions in the postwar period. According to Truman biographer [[Robert Dallek]], "His contribution to victory in the cold war without a devastating nuclear conflict elevated him to the stature of a great or near-great president."{{sfn |Dallek|2008|p=152}} The 1992 publication of [[David McCullough]]'s favorable biography of Truman further cemented the view of Truman as a highly regarded chief executive.{{sfn | Dallek|2008|p=152}} According to historian Donald R. McCoy in his book on the Truman presidency:

{{quote|Harry Truman himself gave a strong and far-from-incorrect impression of being a tough, concerned and direct leader. He was occasionally vulgar, often partisan, and usually nationalistic&nbsp;... On his own terms, Truman can be seen as having prevented the coming of a [[World War III|third world war]] and having preserved from Communist oppression much of what he called the free world. Yet clearly he largely failed to achieve his [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilsonian]] aim of securing perpetual peace, making the world safe for democracy, and advancing opportunities for individual development internationally.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=318–19}}}}

In 1953, Truman received the [[Solomon Bublick Award]] of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].
In 1956, Truman traveled to Europe with his wife. In England, he met with Churchill and received an honorary [[Doctor of Civil Law]] degree from Oxford University. Across Britain he was hailed; London's ''Daily Telegraph'' characterized Truman as the "Living and kicking symbol of everything that everybody likes best about the United States."{{Sfn | McCullough | 1992 | pp = 952–59, quote on p. 959}} In 1959, he was given a 50-year award by the [[Freemasonry|Masons]], recognizing his longstanding involvement: he was initiated on February 9, 1909, into the Belton [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Lodge in Missouri. In 1911, he helped establish the Grandview Lodge, and he served as its first Worshipful Master. In September 1940, during his Senate re-election campaign, Truman was elected [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of the Missouri [[Grand Lodge]] of Freemasonry; Truman said later that the Masonic election assured his victory in the general election. In 1945, he was made a 33° Sovereign Grand Inspector General and an Honorary Member of the supreme council at the Supreme Council A.A.S.R. Southern Jurisdiction Headquarters in Washington D.C.{{sfn |Grand Lodge-Pennsylvania| 2011}}{{sfn |''Time''|March 24, 1952}} He was also a member of the [[Shriners]] and the [[Royal Order of Jesters]], two [[Masonic bodies#Other affiliated bodies|affiliated bodies]] of Masonry.<ref>{{cite book |last1=United States Congress |title=Memorial Services in the Congress of the United States and Tributes in Eulogy of Harry S.

In 1975, the [[Truman Scholarship]] was created as a federal program to honor U.S. college students who exemplified dedication to public service and leadership in public policy.{{sfn|Truman Scholarship|2012}} In 2004, the President Harry S. Truman Fellowship in National Security Science and Engineering was created as a distinguished postdoctoral three-year appointment at [[Sandia National Laboratories]].{{sfn|Truman Fellowship|2012}} In 2001, the [[University of Missouri]] established the [[Truman School of Public Affairs|Harry S. Truman School of Public Affairs]] to advance the study and practice of governance.{{sfn|Truman School of Public Affairs|2010}} The University of Missouri's [[Missouri Tigers]] athletic programs have an official mascot named [[Truman the Tiger]]. On July 1, 1996, Northeast Missouri State University became [[Truman State University]]—to mark its transformation from a [[Teachers College|teachers' college]] to a highly selective [[liberal arts university]] and to honor the only Missourian to become president. A member institution of the [[City Colleges of Chicago]], [[Harry S Truman College]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], is named in his honor for his dedication to public colleges and universities. In 2000, the headquarters for the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], built in the 1930s but never officially named, was dedicated as the [[Harry S Truman Building]].{{sfn|CNN|2000}} The [[Truman Sports Complex]], which contains the home stadiums for the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[Kansas City Royals]] and is located close to Kansas City's border with Independence, is named after the former president.

Despite Truman's attempt to curtail the naval carrier arm, which led to the 1949 [[Revolt of the Admirals]],{{sfn|''Time''|October 17, 1949}} an aircraft carrier, {{USS|Harry S. Truman|CVN-75|6}}, was named for him in February 1996. {{sfn |NavSource Online|2012}} The 129th Field Artillery Regiment is designated "Truman's Own" in recognition of Truman's service as commander of its D Battery during [[World War I]].{{sfn|Army National Guard|2012}}

In 1984, Truman was posthumously awarded the United States [[Congressional Gold Medal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artandhistory.house.gov/house_history/goldmedal.aspx |work=Office of the Clerk |title=Congressional Gold Medal Recipients |publisher=House of Representatives |accessdate=August 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723055434/http://artandhistory.house.gov/house_history/goldMedal.aspx |archivedate=July 23, 2011 |df= }}</ref> In 1991, he was inducted into the [[Hall of Famous Missourians]], and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of the [[Missouri State Capitol]].{{sfn|''Hall of Famous Missourians''|2012}}
