'''Box Office Mojo''' is an American website that tracks [[box office]] [[revenue]] in a systematic, [[algorithm]]ic way. The site was founded in 1998 by Brandon Gray, and was bought in 2008 by [[IMDb]], which itself is owned by [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].

== History ==
Brandon Gray began the site on August 7, 1998<ref name=open/> making forecasts of the top 10 highest-grossing films in the United States for the following weekend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/forecast98.html|title=Forecast Archive 1998|accessdate=May 3, 2020|website=Box Office Mojo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816200829/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/forecast98.html|archive-date=August 16, 2000|url-status=dead}}</ref>  To compare his forecasts to the actual results, he started posting the weekend grosses and wrote a regular column with box office analysis and in 1999, he started to post the Friday daily box office grosses, sourced from Exhibitor Relations, so that they were publicly available for free online on Saturdays<ref name=open>{{cite book|first1=Dade|last1=Hayes|first2=Jonathan|last2=Bing|title=Open Wide: How Hollywood Box Office Became a National Obsession|publisher=Miramax Books|year=2004|isbn=1401352006|pages=296-7}}</ref> and posted the Sunday weekend estimates on Sundays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/|title=Brandon Gray's Box Office Mojo|accessdate=May 3, 2020|date=October 7, 1999|website=Box Office Mojo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991008185322/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/|archive-date=October 8, 1999|url-status=dead}}</ref> As well as the weekend grosses, he was publishing the daily grosses, release schedules as well as other charts, such as all-time charts, international box office charts, genre charts, actor and director charts. The site gradually expanded to include weekend charts going back to 1982 and grosses for older films and the international section expanded to cover the weekly box office of 50 countries, international release schedules as well as box office results from up to 107 countries. 

In 2002, Gray partnered with Sean Saulsbury and grew the site to nearly two million readers.<ref>[https://www.boxofficemojo.com/about/?ref=ft "About Box Office Mojo"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119145314/http://boxofficemojo.com/about/?ref=ft |date=November 19, 2010 }}.

On October 23, 2019, Box Office Mojo unveiled a dramatic redesign resembling IMDb, and was rebranded as "Box Office Mojo by IMDbPro". The redesign was heavily criticized for being difficult to navigate and moving much of its content behind a [[paywall]]. Several features previously provided for free, such as box office data for franchises, genres, actors, filmmakers, distributors, budgets, and inflation-adjusted figures were moved to [[IMDbPro]], the subscription service of IMDb.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/box-office-mojo-criticized-after-redesign-that-includes-a-paywall-for-some-data/|title=Box Office Mojo Criticized After Redesign That Includes a Paywall for Some Data|last=Fuster|first=Jeremy|date=October 24, 2019|website=TheWrap|language=en-US|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/box-office-mojo-site-transformed-imdb-1203381584/|title=Box Office Mojo Site Transformed by IMDbPro|last=McNary|first=Dave|date=October 24, 2019|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-mojo-undergoes-dramatic-overhaul-1249672|title=Box Office Mojo Undergoes Dramatic Overhaul|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref> However, on March 31, 2020, certain features that were locked behind the paywall were freed. These include the brand, franchise and genre lists which were put under an "Indices" section.<ref>https://www.boxofficemojo.com/brand/?ref_=bo_nb_hm_tab</ref>
