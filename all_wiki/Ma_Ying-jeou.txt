===Controversy over birthplace===
On 11 December 2008, [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) legislator [[Chai Trong-rong]] called a [[press conference]] and produced a document that alleges Ma's [[birthplace]] to be contrary to what is officially reported. On this document, the birth certificate for one of Ma's daughters, Ma fills out "[[Shenzhen|Shengchin]]" {{sic}} as his own birthplace, contradictory to his officially reported birthplace of "Hong Kong".

Chai also noted that First Lady [[Christine Chow]]'s birthplace was listed as "[[Nanjing|Nanking, China]]", though she is listed as also being born in Hong Kong.

Chai claimed that since Ma was born after 1949 and in [[Shenzhen]], he is legally a [[Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China|citizen]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. Presidential Spokesperson Wang Yu-chi ({{zh|labels=no|t=王郁琦}}) responded to Chai's charges by reaffirming that all information from the President's Office regarding the President's birth is accurate. Wang also informed that Ma, on his 11 December visit to Hong Kong, was able to obtain records of his birth at Kowloon's [[Kwong-Wah Hospital]] and Ma also keeps the original of his [[birth certificate]] issued by the [[Registrar General]] of Hong Kong,<ref name="Liberty Times 2008-12-12"/> thereby confirming once again his birth in the former [[British Hong Kong|British colony]] instead of mainland China. Copies of Ma's birth certificate have also been previously shown to the public.<ref>Chang Rich (4 February 2009). [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2009/02/04/2003435261 Chai says president continues to lie about his birthplace]. ''[[Taipei Times]]''.</ref> Wang also dispelled rumors that Ma had received [[affirmative action]] in his applications to [[Jianguo High School]] and the [[National Taiwan University]] with an "[[overseas Chinese]]" status.<ref name="Liberty Times 2008-12-12"/>

==Rise in politics==
In the 1980s Ma Ying-jeou started working for [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] as Deputy Director of the First Bureau of the Presidential Office and the President's English interpreter. Ma was later promoted to the chair of the [[Research, Development and Evaluation Commission]] under the [[Executive Yuan]] at the age of 38, becoming the youngest cabinet member in the ROC government.<ref>Tsao, W. Y. (1988). ''Free China review''. '''38'''. (7–12).</ref>

Ma was deputy [[List of Secretaries-General of the Kuomintang|secretary-general]] of the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] from 1984 to 1988, also serving for a period as deputy of the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] (MAC), a cabinet-level body in charge of [[cross-strait relations]].<ref>[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200508/19/eng20050819_203496.html Ma Ying-jeou, new chairman of Chinese KMT].

''The Victoria Advocate''. 30 June 1996.</ref> He remained a supporter of the [[Kuomintang]], rather than supporting the [[New Party (Republic of China)|New Party]] formed by KMT supporters who campaigned on an anti-corruption platform. Ma returned to academia and most people at the time{{who|date=April 2020}} believed his political career to have effectively ended.

==Mayoralty==
[[File:2006INGTaipeiMarathon YJMa.jpg|thumb|Mayor Ma at the 2006 10th Taipei International Marathon.]]
In 1998, the KMT fielded Ma to challenge the then-incumbent Taipei mayor [[Chen Shui-bian]] of the opposition [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP), who was seeking re-election.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nationalists Oust Taipei Mayor in Vote Watched by China |author=Erik Eckholm |url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E7DF163AF935A35751C1A96E958260 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=6 December 1998 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref> Despite Chen's public approval rating of around 70%,<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Moore |first1=Jonathan |last2=Roberts |first2=Dexter |title=Taipei's mayor: The man China fears |url=http://www.businessweek.com/1998/46/b3604055.htm |accessdate=30 September 2014 |magazine=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=16 November 1998 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121170446/http://www.businessweek.com/1998/46/b3604055.htm |archivedate=21 January 2011}}</ref> he was defeated.

Ma again dissuaded angry Pan-Blue supporters from protesting, following the very close re-election victory of President Chen in 2004 after the [[3-19 shooting incident]].<ref>{{cite news |title = Ma finally tells protesters they should go home |author = Jewel Huang |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/03/22/2003107257 |newspaper = Taipei Times |date=22 March 2004 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref> Ma chose not to join in calls to challenge or contest the election.<ref>{{cite news |title = Ma: Jump ship while the lifeboat is in reach |author=Andy Morton |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2004/03/27/2003107967 |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=27 March 2004 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref> Ma also avoided associating himself with claims that the assassination was staged.

Ma suffered some political damage as a result of the [[SARS]] epidemic in early 2003 and was criticized for not mobilizing the Taipei city government quickly enough and for keeping Chiu Shu-ti, the public health director, who was previously criticized for her lack of concern for the outbreak.<ref>{{cite news |title=Health-bureau head under fire |author=Debby Wu |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2003/05/17/0000210906 |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=17 May 2003 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref> [[Typhoon Aere (2004)|Flooding in metropolitan Taipei]] in 2004 also led to public questioning of his leadership and caused Ma's approval rating to slide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ma defies critics, to keep rapid transit chief |url = http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/2004/09/15/52432/Ma-defies.htm |newspaper=China Post |date=15 September 2004 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref>

Ma's cross-political following has led some to note him as a rare example of relative civility in the notoriously rough and tumble world of Taiwanese politics. Ma has generally avoided being accused of using the vitriolic and sometimes offensive rhetoric common in Taiwanese political debate. His academic background and bearing have helped cultivate the image of Ma as an honest, dispassionate technocrat. Despite this reputation, and his wooden speaking style and shy demeanor, Ma is also considered a charismatic figure and is popular among women and youth. On the other hand, Ma's critics claim that Ma, overeager to appear unbiased and/or neutral, is overly indecisive and lacks bold vision. Ma is often accused of avoiding being out in front on some of the more vigorous or controversial criticisms of President Chen or opposing parties, or involving himself in intra-party disputes. Among these critics, Ma has been referred to as a "[[non-stick]] [[cooking pan|pan]]" or "[[Teflon character|Teflon]]-man." Recently, there has also been some criticism of his stumping for election candidates suspected of and later indicted for corruption charges. Many in the [[Pan-Green Coalition]] expressed opinions that Ma misled voters by lending his clean charismatic image to unscrupulous candidates in his own party.

In recent years, Ma has increasingly employed [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese (Hoklo)]] in public speaking, perhaps to avoid backlash for his parents' mainland China origins, and he has called himself a "child of [[Wanhua District|Bangka (Wanhua)]]", identifying himself with the historic district of Taipei where he grew up. Others claim that Ma's mainland Chinese ancestry will further alienate members of the KMT who are "light-blue" vs. the pro-unification "deep-blue."

===Mayoral controversies===
While often nicknamed as the "Teflon pot" for his extreme preservation of his personal image, Ma was nonetheless caught in some political controversies. A series of mishaps during his tenure as the mayor of Taipei, including the administration problems that enlarged the extent of the [[2001 Pacific typhoon season#Typhoon Nari (Kiko)|Typhoon Nari]] (納莉風災),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntpu.edu.tw/pa/Paper/3601.pdf |script-title=zh:台北市政府防災組織與功能研究：納莉風災的省思 |language=Chinese |author=丘昌泰 |author2=楊永年、趙家民等 |publisher=[[National Taipei University]] |accessdate=2007-11-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409120815/http://www.ntpu.edu.tw/pa/Paper/3601.pdf |archivedate=9 April 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> the shutdown of Hoping Hospital (和平封院事件),<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.taipei.gov.tw/taipei_news/9206b/images/197/SARS.doc |title = 台北市立和平醫院處理嚴重急性呼吸道症候群（SARS）事件調查報告|author=臺北市政府專案調查小組 |date=12 June 2003 |accessdate=2007-11-15 |format=[[DOC (computing)|DOC]] |publisher=台北市政府网站 |language=zh |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050507003745/http://www.taipei.gov.tw/taipei_news/9206b/images/197/SARS.doc |archivedate = 7 May 2005}}</ref> the [[Phosgene]] Incident (捷運光氣事件), the [[Scalping]] Incident (捷運扯頭皮事件) and the Human Ball Scandal (邱小妹人球事件) (in which a severely beaten four-year-old girl was bounced from hospital to hospital without treatment, until she died of her injuries),<ref>http://www.tzuchi.com.tw/file/tcmj/94-3/3-1.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> impaired Ma's reputation. However, Ma maneuvered through these incidents relatively unscathed.

One of Ma's most satisfactory mayoral constructions was the [[Maokong Gondola]]. However, the frequent breakdown of the gondola earned the residents' distrust of the new transportation system. One poll showed only 14% of the Taipei City residents were satisfied with it,<ref>{{cite news |script-title = zh:貓纜變懶貓 滿意度僅14％ |author = 林恕暉 |url = http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2007/new/aug/1/today-life9-2.htm |newspaper = [[Liberty Times]] |date = 8 January 2007 |language = Chinese |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134452/http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2007/new/aug/1/today-life9-2.htm |archivedate = 29 September 2007}}</ref> and it even led to protests.<ref>[http://www.jour.nccu.edu.tw/students/wenshan_people/protest/1 誰的貓空？誰的纜車？—地方居民抗爭全紀錄] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121095352/http://www.jour.nccu.edu.tw/students/wenshan_people/protest/1 |date=21 January 2008 }}'', Chengchi University, 8/21''</ref> The Taiwan Environmental Information Center (台灣環境資訊協會) states that the choice to use a [[gondola lift]] intended for [[temperate zone]]s in a [[tropical zone]] shows the failure of the Taipei City government led by Ma.<ref name="Environment">Lee Yu-chin [http://e-info.org.tw/node/24137 貓纜通車首日故障 爆出市府公共政策問題]'', Taiwan Environmental Information Center, 5 July 2007''</ref>

===Corruption allegations===
On 14 November 2006, Ma was questioned by prosecutors over his alleged misuse of a special expenses account as Taipei mayor.  This occurred after [[Chen Shui-Bian]] was being investigated for corruption, and many KMT supporters believed that this prosecution was politically motivated.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

At the same time, rumors surfaced that former party chairman [[Lien Chen]] would run in the presidential election of 2008. The incident may have affected the clean image of Ma and his political future. The next day, Ma admitted one of his aides forged receipts to claim Ma's expenses as Taipei mayor, and apologized for the latest political scandal.<ref>{{cite news |author= Mo Yan-chih |title=Ma sorry for 'administrative defects' |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2006/11/16/2003336530 |newspaper= Taipei Times|date=16 November 2006|accessdate= 2007-02-23}}</ref> However, Ma argued that he, like most other government officials, regarded the special expense account as supplemental salary for personal expenses undertaken in the course of official duties and that his use of this account was legal.

On 13 February 2007, Ma was indicted by the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office on charges of allegedly embezzling approximately NT$11 million (US$339,000), regarding the issue of "special expenses" while he was mayor of Taipei.<ref>{{cite news|author=Peter Enav |title=Taiwanese opposition leader indicted |url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2007/02/13/taiwanese_opposition_leader_indicted/ |work=The Boston Globe |date=13 February 2007 |accessdate=22 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080514152818/http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2007/02/13/taiwanese_opposition_leader_indicted/ |archivedate = 14 May 2008}}</ref> The prosecutor's office said that Ma had allegedly used government funds for personal use, such as paying for one of his daughter's living expenses while studying abroad and paying for his household utilities.

Shortly after the indictment, he submitted his resignation as chairman of the [[Kuomintang]] in accordance with party rules which prohibit an indicted person from serving as KMT chairman<ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6356775.stm |work = BBC News |title = Taiwan opposition leader resigns |date=13 February 2007 |accessdate = 5 April 2010}}</ref> The resignation was initially rejected but then accepted by the party's Central Standing Committee before amending a clause that barred members from running for office if charged with a crime.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20071228/wl_nm/taiwan_ma_dc_1] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Shortly after the resignation, however, Ma announced his presidential candidacy.

On 24 April 2008, the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]] cleared Ma of corruption charges, delivering a final ruling in this matter before his inauguration on 20 May 2008.

On the same day he resigned as chairman of the KMT, Ma also announced his intention to run in the 2008 presidential election. He was the official nominee of the Kuomintang for the 2008 presidential election.

Ma visited [[India]] and [[Singapore]] in June 2007 to increase bilateral exchanges as well as to gain legitimacy and experience for his 2008 presidential bid.

Ma's vice-presidential running mate was former premier [[Vincent Siew]], Lien Chan's running mate in the 2000 presidential election.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ma said to pick Siew for 2008 race |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/113108.htm |newspaper= China Post |date=23 June 2007 |accessdate=2007-06-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024243/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/113108.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007}}</ref>

During a campaigning event in an [[Taiwanese aborigines|aboriginal]] community, Ma made a controversial remark. Responding to a question from an aboriginal woman, Ma said, "If you come into the city, you are a Taipei citizen... Aborigines should adjust their mentality – if you come into the city you have to play by its rules."<ref>{{cite news |title=Ma humiliated Aborigines: Hsieh |author=Ko Shu-ling |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/12/27/2003394300 |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=27 December 2007}}</ref> This statement was thought to be extremely inappropriate.<ref>{{cite news |script-title=zh:「把原民當人看」馬發言挨批 |url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2007/new/dec/27/today-p3.htm |newspaper=[[Liberty Times]] |date=27 December 2007 |accessdate=17 August 2008 |language=Chinese}}</ref>

A week before the presidential election, incumbent President [[Chen Shui-bian]] vowed to quit if Ma could provide legal documents of the invalidation of his green card. The DPP presidential candidate [[Frank Hsieh]] also said that he was willing to withdraw from the race if Ma could prove, using official documents, that his green card was invalidated twenty years ago.<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/03/16/2003405765 Presidential election 2008: 6 days to go: Chen vows to quit if Ma proves he has no green card], Taipei Times, 16 March 2008</ref> Ma responded the next day to the president that he should work on improving Taiwan's [[economy]] instead of caring about the election so much; earlier, Ma also provided copies of US non-immigrant visas issued to him during the 1980s and 1990s, claiming the card was invalid, as such visas are not issued to green card holders.

====Environmental criticism====
Ma has been criticized by many [[environmental group]]s. His mayoral construction of the [[Maokong Gondola]] was criticized by the Taiwan Environmental Information Center.<ref name="Environment"/> The construction of the [[Taipei Arena]] also drew negative reactions from these groups. The Society of Wilderness (SOW; 荒野保護協會) pointed out that of the three hundred and eighty-four trees that were moved for the construction, more than a hundred had already died.<ref name="Tree">{{cite news |script-title=zh:老樹爭議 巨蛋環評續保留 |url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/mar/18/today-taipei3.htm |newspaper=Liberty Times |date=18 March 2008 |language=Chinese |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323041930/http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/mar/18/today-taipei3.htm |archivedate=23 March 2008}}</ref> The city government said that the ages of the trees are unknown; therefore, they are not protected by law. The SOW then responded that, according to pictures taken by the [[United States Air Force]] in 1947 and 1948, these trees were present already during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule era]].<ref name="Tree"/>

During his presidential campaign, Ma participated in one of the [[debate]]s that discussed many topics, including [[environmental protection]]. The Taiwan Academy of Ecology evaluated the policies of both candidates [[Hsieh]] and Ma, and the secretary of its workstation in [[Taipei]] said that both candidates failed their expectations, but they had more hope for Hsieh than Ma because Ma's environmental concepts lack considerations of reality.<ref name="EP">{{cite news |script-title=zh:環團︰都不及格 但謝還有救 |url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/feb/25/today-fo1-2.htm |newspaper=Liberty Times |date=25 February 2008 |language=Chinese}}</ref> In February 2008, several environmental groups created a list of commitments for the two candidates to sign. DPP candidate [[Frank Hsieh]] agreed to all the items on the list and signed it in March. Ma did not and emailed the group instead. The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) criticized Ma for ignoring important issues and not having the guts to sign the commitments.<ref>{{cite news |script-title=zh:不敢給承諾 環團批馬沒擔當 |url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/mar/13/today-p9.htm |newspaper=Liberty Times |date=13 March 2008 |language=Chinese |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323054611/http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/mar/13/today-p9.htm |archivedate=23 March 2008}}</ref>

After Ma was elected president on 22 March 2008, the [[Green Party Taiwan]] expressed its fear that president-elect Ma would focus too much on improving the [[economy]] and would ignore many critical environmental issues. The head of the Environmental Quality Protection Foundation also emphasized the importance of environmental protection as one of the factors of economic development.<ref>{{cite news |script-title=zh:環團憂馬只重經濟不重環保 |url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/mar/24/today-life2.htm |newspaper=Liberty Times |date=24 March 2008 |language=Chinese |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326231134/http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/mar/24/today-life2.htm |archivedate=26 March 2008}}</ref>

Ma took office on 20 May 2008.<ref>Ralph Jennings, [http://www.iht.com/articles/reuters/2008/05/20/asia/OUKWD-UK-TAIWAN-PRESIDENT.php "Taiwan new leader takes office on China pledges"], Reuters (''International Herald Tribune''), 20 May 2008.</ref> The inaugural ceremony took place in the [[Taipei Arena]] in [[Taipei]]. A [[state dinner]] took place in [[Kaohsiung]] the same day.

Ma was named among the 2008 [[Time 100]] in its "Leaders & Revolutionaries" section. He is described by ''Time'' as "one of those rare politicians who have an opportunity to shape the destiny not only of their own nation but also of an entire region."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1733748_1733757_1735546,00.html | work=Time | title=The 2008 Time 100 | date=30 April 2009 | accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>

On 12 August 2008, Ma embarked on his first foreign trip as president. Ma's visit centered upon improving relations with Taiwan's Latin American allies. He attended the inaugurations of both [[Leonel Fernández]] of the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Fernando Lugo]] of [[Paraguay]]. Ma also made a stop at [[Panama]] and met with President [[Martin Torrijos]]. There was an emphasis that there would be no new aid packages during the visits; if any new economic aid were to be announced, they would be announced from Taiwan and not from abroad. The trip included U.S. stop-overs in [[Los Angeles]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], and [[San Francisco]]. Ma's trip across the Pacific was via commercial flight and only chartered a smaller jet from the United States; he was accompanied by an 81-member delegation.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080812/wl_asia_afp/taiwandiplomacyuslatam_080812141054 "Taiwan president heads to Latin America, via US"].

===Cross-strait relations===
Ma, in his inaugural address, laid out his promise in dealing with cross-strait relations that there would be "no reunification, no independence, and no war" (不統, 不獨, 不武) during his tenure as president.<ref>{{cite news |script-title=zh:台灣‧就職演說強調不統不獨不武‧馬英九吁兩岸協商 |url=http://news.sina.com/int/sinchewdaily/105-103-102-101/2008-05-20/02332912835.html |newspaper=Sin Chew Daily |date=20 May 2008 |language=Chinese}}</ref> Critics argue that Ma, rather than follow his campaign promise, has been following his father's will instead, where [[Ma Ho-ling]] clearly states his final words were "Repress independence supporters; Lead (Taiwan) to unification." During an interview in [[England]] in 2006, Ma affirmed that his goal was to lead Taiwan to "eventual unification."<ref>{{cite news|script-title=zh:骨灰罈上「化獨漸統興中國」 馬父遺志子題字 |url=http://www.nownews.com/2007/10/29/301-2179345.htm |newspaper=nownews.com |date=29 October 2007 |language=Chinese |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614151330/http://www.nownews.com/2007/10/29/301-2179345.htm |archivedate=14 June 2011 }}</ref>

An article published in the 11 August 2008 edition of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' said that in less than three months' time, "relations between Taiwan and PRC have arguably seen the most rapid advancement in the six-decade standoff between the two governments. Ma launched direct [[Cross-strait charter|weekend charter flights between PRC and Taiwan]] for the first time, opened Taiwan to mainland Chinese tourists, eased restrictions on Taiwan investment in mainland China and approved measures that will allow mainland Chinese investors to buy Taiwan stocks."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1831748,00.html?xid=rss-topstories |title="Talking to Taiwan's New President".

During the [[Second Chen-Chiang summit]] visit by [[Chen Yunlin]] on 3 November 2008, chairman of the Beijing-based [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]] (ARAT), the opposition [[Pan-Green Coalition]] criticized the visit as "taking steps toward eventual reunification" and damaging Taiwan's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite news |script-title=zh:扁嗆特偵組：馬上來捉我 |url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/oct/4/today-p1-3.htm |newspaper=Liberty Times |date=4 October 2008 |accessdate=27 October 2008 |language=Chinese |trans-title=Chen Shui-bian challenges the Special Investigation Unit: Come Arrest Me at Once |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007165316/http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/oct/4/today-p1-3.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |script-title=zh:馬稱兩岸非國與國 李斥叛國 |url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/sep/7/today-fo1.htm |newspaper=Liberty Times |date=7 September 2008 |accessdate=27 October 2008 |language=Chinese |trans-title=Ma: "Special non-state-to-state" Lee: "Treason" |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915094514/http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/sep/7/today-fo1.htm |archivedate=15 September 2008}}</ref> Opposition to the visit by the chairman of the ARAT also [[1025 rally to safeguard Taiwan|sparked massive peaceful rallies and protests]] organised by the opposition DPP party on 25 October 2008.

Chen's visit was the highest level visit from mainland China to Taiwan that had taken place since the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949. Chen was expected to meet with his Taipei-based counterpart, [[Chiang Pin-kung]] beginning on 4 November 2008. The two sides signed four agreements on 5 November, detailing the loosening of restrictions with regards to air, marine, and postal links as well as better regulations on food safety.<ref>{{cite news |title=China, Taiwan to Sign Agreements Nov. 5, Evening News Reports |first=Yu-huay |last=Sun  |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=axDHoZl0J.BU |newspaper=Bloomberg |date=27 October 2008}}</ref> The Ma government refused to disclose the treaties only until days before they went into effect.<ref name="libertytimes.com.tw">{{cite news |script-title=zh:馬英九跟著陳雲林說謊 |url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/oct/29/today-o5.htm |newspaper=Liberty Times |date=29 October 2008 |language=Chinese |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506001513/http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/oct/29/today-o5.htm |archivedate=6 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

During Chen's visit in Taipei, he was met with a series of strong protests directed at himself and Ma Ying-jeou, some of which were violent, with [[Molotov cocktails]] being thrown by the protesters at riot police. A series of arrests were made after the protests, with a secret letter being sent from the police to a member of the media.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/local/taipei/2008/11/08/182205/18-arrested.htm |title=18 arrested for 'disturbing order' in siege protest |newspaper=China Post |date=8 November 2008}}</ref> Local police reported that 149 of its officers were injured during the opposition protests.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081108/wl_nm/us_taiwan_police_1] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Chen referred to Ma simply as "Mr. Ma," not as "President". However, this is consistent with the previous convention in 2008, when KMT ex-politician [[Lien Chan]] met [[Hu Jintao]] [[APEC Peru 2008|in Peru]]. Lien did not call the PRC [[paramount leader]] [[Hu Jintao]] "[[President of the People's Republic of China|President]]," but instead used his title "[[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]]" as the [[Leader of the Communist Party of China]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lien Chan meets with Hu Jintao at APEC summit |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan-relations/2008/11/23/184452/p1/Lien-Chan.htm |agency=Central News Agency |location=Taipei |date=23 November 2008}}</ref>

After the chaos during and after Chen's visit, college students and professors launched a peaceful sitout, known as the [[Wild Strawberry student movement]] ({{zh|t=野草莓運動}}), demanding a more reasonable assembly law and a stop to police violence. A few days into the sitout, the prime minister Liu Chao-shiuan accidentally spoke of his opinion during an interview on air that he did not think the movement would last more than three days, angering students, professors, and the general public.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} In the end, the sitout lasted one month. Then, it moved into an organizational direction. However, the polls in two of Taiwan's biggest newspapers after the visit still reported that about 70% of the Taiwanese public considered Chen's visit to have a positive effect on Taiwan's development, while 22% of the respondents thought the effect would be negative, with the remaining 8% not expressing an opinion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chen Yulin ends historic visit |author=William Foreman |url = http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan-relations/2008/11/07/182080/Chen-Yulin.htm |agency=Associated Press|date=7 November 2008}}</ref> The opposition [[Pan-Green]] caucus have continuously alleged this result being a form of [[media manipulation]] by the KMT. However, other major polls in Taiwanese newspapers and news websites have shown similar results regardless of political alignment.

On 11 September 2008, Ma's cabinet unveiled a $5.6-billion USD ($180-billion TWD) economic stimulus package. Among the items of the package were infrastructure projects, economic incentives to small businesses, and other tax cuts. Stock transaction taxes were also halved for the next six months. Taiwan's economy was projected to grow 4.3% in 2008, down from 5.7 in 2007, according to [[Fitch Ratings]].<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080911/bs_afp/taiwaneconomy_080911071112] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ong |first=Janet |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&sid=aAMp3a3FzKms |title=Taiwan to Spend NT$181 Billion on Economy, Stocks (Update3) |publisher=Bloomberg |date=11 September 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}</ref>

Although an economic stimulus plan was introduced, Taiwan stocks still closed lower on 11 September 2008. The [[Financial Times]] describes Taiwan's economic downturn as results from "downward pressure driven by global factors." Analysts also point out that, "during its first 100 days in office, the government has made a series of bold steps to deregulate economic Cross-Strait ties.

Shipping companies, due to shorter voyages and time savings, are able to save up to US$120 million (TWD $4 billion) each year. Previously, shipping companies from both sides of the strait were required to reroute their ships into third-country waters. The two sides also agreed that neither the ROC nor the PRC flag will be displayed when a ship enters port.<ref>[http://news.alibaba.com/article/detail/china/100031200-1-update%253A-taiwan-president-hails-china.html UPDATE: Taiwan President Hails China Transport Links].

===Typhoon Morakot===
{{Main|Typhoon Morakot#Taiwan 2}}
[[Typhoon Morakot (2009)|Typhoon Morakot]], the worst typhoon to strike Taiwan in fifty years, hit Taiwan on 8 August 2009. In the storm's aftermath, President Ma was criticized for his handling of the disaster by both sides of Taiwan's political spectrum. Many news outlets likened Typhoon Morakot to being Ma's "[[Hurricane Katrina]]." Editorials and political commentators accused Ma of, among other charges, poor leadership and poor crisis management. Many critics believe that hundreds of lives could have been spared, had the Ma administration been aware of the typhoon's seriousness. Taiwan's political commentators were most critical of Ma's refusal to declare a state of emergency and fully mobilize the military. Instead, Ma Ying-jeou blamed the local governments, which were under the control of the DPP in Southern Taiwan, for not having the villagers evacuated earlier.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0818/p06s01-woap.html|title=Taiwan president under fire over typhoon response|last=Jonathan Adam |date=18 August 2009|newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=25 August 2009}}</ref> Ma's approval ratings sank from 52% (in May) to 29% in a [[United Daily News]] poll.

Following pressure from the opposition, Ma took steps to publicly apologize for his government's failure to respond swiftly with rescue and recovery efforts. Ma cancelled 2009's Double Ten Day national celebrations and his state visit to the [[Solomon Islands]] for the Third Taiwan-South Pacific summit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asianewsnet.net/news.php?id=7379|title=Asia News Network|url-status=usurped|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615161921/http://www.asianewsnet.net/news.php?id=7379|archivedate=15 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=President Ma apologizes |author=David Young |url = http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2009/08/19/221035/President-Ma.htm |newspaper=China Post |date=19 August 2009}}</ref> A probe was launched to investigate why government response was slow and inadequate, and vice foreign minister [[Andrew Hsia]] tendered his resignation to Ma's premier, [[Liu Chao-shiuan]].

Another controversy arose in the disaster's aftermath involved a document leaked from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that instructed the ROC embassies and representative offices to turn down aids from foreign nations. Vice Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia made an explanation, saying that it was meant to say "presently" foreign aids were not needed, but nevertheless took the blame and offered to resign. However, critics were convinced that Hsia's resignation was only to cover-up the fact that Ma gave the order to turn down foreign aids.<ref>{{cite video |people= |date=10 September 2009 |script-title=zh:拒外援請辭 夏立言：我竟成「救災不力」主嫌 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHjDLhIlXe4 |medium= |language=Chinese |work=China Times}}</ref>

===2012 presidential campaign===
{{Main|2012 Republic of China presidential election}}
Ma was eligible for a second term as president and ran for re-election.

In June 2011, when incumbent Vice President Vincent Siew announced he will retire and not seek a second term, Premier [[Wu Den-yih]] was chosen to replace Siew on the KMT's 2012 ticket. Ma was re-elected President with 51.6% of the vote against [[Democratic Progressive Party]] chairwoman [[Tsai Ing-wen]].

In October 2017, a court ruled in Ma's favor in a defamation case he had brought against [[Liang Wen-chieh]] (梁文傑) of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in 2011, after Liang had claimed on TV that Ma had received NT$300 million in illegal political donations during a meeting with Chen Ying-chu (陳盈助).<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/10/25/2003680994|title=Court rules in Ma's favor in defamation case against Liang - Taipei Times|website=Taipei Times|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> The court ordered Liang to pay NT$1.2 million (US$39,643).<ref name=":0" />

===View on independence===
In February 2006, while visiting [[Europe]], Ma said that although he and the KMT favor eventual reunification, the KMT respects the opinions of Taiwanese people and independence is a choice for the people of Taiwan. This caused widespread criticism within the party and from the PRC. In a December 2005 Newsweek International interview, when asked about unification, Ma stated that "for our party, the eventual goal is reunification, but we don't have a timetable."<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10511672/site/newsweek/ Taiwan Mayor on Unification with China – Newsweek: International Editions – MSNBC.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915141131/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10511672/site/newsweek/ |date=15 September 2007 }}</ref> Perhaps to deflect heavy criticism from the [[Pan-Green Coalition]], the KMT later made an advertisement in the [[Liberty Times]] recognizing that independence is an option for the Taiwanese people. [[Wang Jin-pyng]] praised Ma for the policy shift, since Wang himself made a similar statement during the 2004 election, but [[James Soong]] said he was "shocked" and [[Lien Chan]] said he was never consulted. This event actually won some welcome voices from Southern Taiwan, where voters customarily favor the [[Pan-Green Coalition]]. One top KMT official said "we might as well let the measles out now so that we will be immune to it when election year comes close, because reunification or independence can be a hot topic by then."{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[File:Ma Ying-jeou (5946).JPG|thumb|280px|Ma Ying-jeou, seen here waving to supporters during a visit to [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] in March 2006, proposed "Five Dos" on dealing with the PRC.]]
Ma clarified later that the current KMT policy of retaining the status quo has not changed and has reiterated this position several times; further, he has also reiterated his party's support of the one-China policy. Ma has defined the status quo as the "Five No's." During a visit to the United States in March 2006, he proposed a "proactive" approach to cross-strait relations which he called the "Five Do's."

On 17 March 2008, Ma threatened to boycott the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]] if elected, should the [[2008 unrest in Tibet]] spiral out of control.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/193045,taiwan-presidential-candidate-threatens-to-boycott-beijing-olympics.html |title = Taiwan presidential candidate threatens to boycott Beijing Olympics: Sports |publisher = earthtimes.org |accessdate=2008-03-19 }}</ref> After he was elected president, he refused to let the [[Dalai Lama]] visit Taiwan, citing the timing as inappropriate. He later approved a visit by the Dalai Lama to lead prayers for [[Typhoon Morakot]] victims in August 2009.

In April 2009, President Ma became the first ROC president to pay homage in person to the [[Yellow Emperor]] who is believed to have founded China as a nation more than 5,000 years ago. Accompanied by all his government leaders, the president sang the ROC's national anthem as the starter.<ref name="chinapost.com.tw">{{cite news |title=President Ma pays homage in person to the Yellow Emperor |author=Joe Hung |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/joe-hung/2009/04/04/202967/President-Ma.htmPresident |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910131529/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/joe-hung/2009/04/04/202967/President-Ma.htmPresident |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 September 2012 |newspaper=China Post |date=4 April 2009 }}</ref> Ma's spokesman said the president wanted to pay his respects to the Yellow Emperor on [[Tomb Sweeping Day|National Tomb-Sweeping Day]] in person to stress the importance of the Chinese ancestor-worshipping tradition.

===View on human rights and democracy===
In June 2009, the anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] in Beijing, a leader of the [[Chinese democracy movement]] and then student leader [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] visited Taiwan, as in previous years, to meet with Ma about human rights and democracy in China.  However, Ma postponed the appointment three times and eventually cancelled the appointment with Wang. In a press meeting with DPP Chairwoman [[Tsai Ing-wen]], Wang Dan spoke of how it has become more difficult to see "President Ma" in comparison to "Mayor Ma of Taipei City." Wang stated that he understood the importance of the cross strait relationship to Taiwan's economy but also stated that a confident government should have nothing to be afraid of.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sg.sevenload.com/item/yt/1EPjsYrFB8U |script-title=zh:兩岸重於人權? 馬放王丹鴿子 |work=sevenload.com |language=Chinese |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716043412/http://sg.sevenload.com/item/yt/1EPjsYrFB8U |archivedate=16 July 2011 }}</ref> Prior to his election as president, Ma was known to be a very vocal supporter of the Chinese democracy movement and had stated that unless Beijing admitted their wrongdoings at Tiananman Square Protests, there would be no talks about reunification.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/2/6/3/n194014.htm |script-title=zh:馬英九：六四不平反 兩岸統一無條件  |work=sevenload.com |language=Chinese}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=May 2020}}

===View on cross-strait relations===
After his success in the presidential election, Ma Ying-jeou said he had no immediate plans to visit [[mainland China]] and would work to fulfill his campaign pledge to improve relations with mainland China, starting direct charter flights, allowing mainland Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan and lifting the ROC's legislative restrictions on the financial sector to invest in mainland China.<ref>{{cite news |title=Taiwan's Ma: No plans to visit China |url = http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/23/taiwan.ma.ap/index.html|publisher=CNN |date=23 March 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080325140758/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/23/taiwan.ma.ap/index.html |archivedate = 25 March 2008}}</ref>

Since then, Ma Ying-jeou has emphasized the "[[1992 Consensus]]" as the existing basis for constructive dialogue and exchange between mainland China and Taiwan. On 12 April 2008, then Vice-President-elect [[Vincent Siew]] formally met with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|CPC General Secretary]] [[Hu Jintao]] at the [[Boao Forum]] in [[Hainan]].

On 2 September 2008, Ma declared that the relations between Taiwan and mainland China were a "[[special non-state-to-state relations|special relationship not between two nations]]", but one that can be handled invoking the "1992 consensus" between the two sides.<ref>{{cite news|title=Taiwan and China in 'special relations': Ma|newspaper=China Post|date=4 September 2008|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan%20relations/2008/09/04/173082/Taiwan-and.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Non-state-to-state' discourse based on Constitution: spokesman |publisher=Central News Agency of the Republic of China |date=11 September 2008 |url=http://times.hinet.net/times/article.do?newsid=1727002&option=english }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Ma refers to China as ROC territory in magazine interview|newspaper=Taipei Times|date=8 October 2008 |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/10/08/2003425320}}</ref> While the governing authorities on mainland China and Taiwan cannot recognise each other as a legitimate government due to legal and constitutional reasons, Ma seeks that they would refrain from denying the other side being the ''de facto'' governing authority of one area of the state.<ref>{{cite news |title = Ma clarifies 'two areas,' reaffirms non-denial |newspaper=China Post |date=25 October 2008 |url = http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan-relations/2008/10/25/180363/Ma-clarifies.htm}}</ref> On 18 October 2008, Ma said he hoped that a cross-strait peace accord could be reached during his term in office.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Taipei Times |url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/10/19/2003426312 |title = Ma hopes for peace deal while he's in office |date=19 October 2008}}</ref>

Ma has received criticism from the DPP, the opposition party, for allegedly praising the PRC on human rights, especially during the [[20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Protests]]. Departing from his usual critical view of the Communists' handling of the 1989 protests, Ma made a statement about the PRC's recent improvements in human rights.<ref>[http://www.zeenews.com/news536585.html Tiananmen 20th anniversary brings new repression].

Within a week of his remarks on Tiananmen, Ma voiced support for the acceptance of [[simplified Chinese]] for written text and the continued use of [[traditional Chinese]] for printed text.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=972259&lang=eng_news&cate_img=49.jpg&cate_rss=news_Society_TAIWAN|title=Taiwan president Ma wants to allow writing in simplified characters |date=10 June 2009}}</ref> Ma had to clarify his remarks regarding simplified characters at a 15-minute speech before the sixth International Conference on Internet Chinese Education on 19 June 2009.
