==Early years==

Clinton was born in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], on February 27, 1980, the only child of [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary]] and [[Bill Clinton]]. Her name was inspired by a visit to the [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] neighborhood of [[London]] during a [[Christmas]] 1978 vacation. Hillary said that upon hearing the 1969 [[Judy Collins]] recording of the [[Joni Mitchell]] song "[[Chelsea Morning]]", Bill remarked, "If we ever have a daughter, her name should be Chelsea."<ref name="Clinton">{{cite book |author=Clinton, Hillary Rodham|year=2003|title=Living History|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-4582-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/livinghistory00clin/page/n101 84]–85, 91, 93|title-link=Living History (book)}}</ref><ref name="Mani">{{cite book|author=Mani, Bonnie G.|year=2007|title=Women, power, and political change|publisher=Lexington Books|page=218}}<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DD1E3BF93AA25752C0A965958260|date=January 19, 1993|title=The Inauguration: Shedding Light on a Morning and a Name|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 6, 2009}}</ref>

==White House years==

[[File:Clinton family.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[White House]] portrait of the Clintons]]

On January 20, 1993, the day of [[Bill Clinton 1993 presidential inauguration|her father's first inauguration]], Chelsea moved into the White House with her parents and was given the [[Secret Service codename]] "Energy".<ref>{{cite book|author=Walsh, Kenneth T.|year=2003|title=Air Force One: A History of the Presidents and Their Planes|publisher=[[Disney Hyperion|Hyperion]]|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4013-0004-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/airforceonehisto00wals}}</ref> The Clintons wanted their daughter to have a normal childhood, and they hoped to shield her from the media spotlight.<ref name="washpo96">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/inaug/players/chelsea.htm|last=Roberts, Roxanne|date=February 27, 1996|title=16 Candles for Chelsea|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=August 3, 2010}}</ref>

Hillary Clinton followed the advice of [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]] on raising children in the White House, and asked the press to limit coverage of Chelsea to her participation in public events such as state visits.<ref name="Mani"/> [[Margaret Truman]], daughter of former president [[Harry S. Truman]], supported the Clintons, and in March 1993 wrote a letter to the editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' about the damage that could be done if the press made Chelsea a subject of intense coverage.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/magazine/l-the-chelsea-show-151593.html|title=The Chelsea Show—Letter to the Editor|last=Daniel|first=Margaret Truman|date=March 21, 1993|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=March 8, 2016}}</ref>

Journalists debated the issue of allowing Clinton to retain her privacy. Most media outlets concluded that she should be off-limits due to her age, although [[Rush Limbaugh]]<ref name="washpo96"/> and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' both broadcast material mocking her appearance.<ref name="ovalofficekids">{{cite news |url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/nevius/article/Just-ask-Chelsea-Jenna-and-Barbara-Escaping-the-2808210.php|title=Just ask Chelsea, Jenna and Barbara: Escaping the glare of the spotlight isn't easy for kids whose dads work in the Oval Office|last=Nevius|first=C.W.|date= January 22, 2004|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}</ref> During this phase of her life, her father said, "We really work hard on making sure that Chelsea doesn't let other people define her sense of her own self-worth&nbsp;...

The Clintons' decision to remove Chelsea from public school and send her to [[Sidwell Friends School]], a private school in Washington,&nbsp;D.C., drew criticism.<ref name="washpo96"/> While several children of sitting presidents have attended Sidwell, the most recent prior child, [[Amy Carter]], had gone to D.C. public schools. In a 1993 ''CBS This Morning'' town meeting, Bill defended the choice, saying Chelsea did not like "getting a lot of publicity" and would have "more control over her destiny" at Sidwell. Bill explained that they made their decision in an effort to protect Chelsea's privacy; they did not "reject the public schools".<ref>The American Presidency Project: [https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-cbs-this-morning-town-meeting Remarks in the "CBS This Morning" Town Meeting.] May 27, 1993.</ref> Sidwell's students and staff remained silent regarding Chelsea, declining to discuss her publicly.<ref name="washpo96"/> A veteran of [[Model United Nations]],<ref>{{cite news |year=2001|accessdate=August 14, 2010|url=https://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/munda/munmore.htm|title=What is the Model UN?}}</ref> Clinton was a 1997 [[National Merit Scholar]]ship semifinalist.<ref name="stanford">{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/04/30/chelsea.choice/|title=AllPolitics—Chelsea Stanford-Bound—April 30, 1997|date=April 30, 1997|publisher=CNN/[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=August 3, 2010}}</ref> She graduated from Sidwell Friends in 1997; her father spoke at the graduation ceremony.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/DC-Decoder/2010/0515/Which-US-presidents-went-back-to-high-school-for-commencement |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516194511/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/DC-Decoder/2010/0515/Which-US-presidents-went-back-to-high-school-for-commencement |archive-date=May 16, 2010 |author=Grier, Peter |date=May 15, 2010 |title=Which US presidents went back to high school ... for commencement? |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref>

Following Chelsea's high school graduation, media speculation regarding her choice of college resulted in heavy press coverage. She ultimately chose to attend [[Stanford University]]. During her father's eight years in office, there were 32 stories in ''The New York Times'' and 87 network news stories about Chelsea. Of all presidential children preceding her, she received the most television coverage.<ref name="Watson">{{cite book|author=Watson, Robert P.|year=2004|title=Life in the White House: a social history of the first family and the president's house|publisher=State University Press of New York|pages=158–59|isbn=978-0-7914-6098-6}}</ref>

Her parents joined her at the youth group's parent-teen round tables. An adult group leader thought Clinton to be "a terrific kid" and observed that she was treated as an equal in the group. Away from church, her social activities included visits to a [[Planet Hollywood]] restaurant with friends and sleep-overs in and out of the White House. President Clinton sometimes joined her and her sleep-over friends for breakfast.<ref name="washpo96"/>

At age four, Clinton had begun taking dance classes in Arkansas,<ref name="CClinton">{{cite web |url=http://www.hillary-rodham-clinton.org/chelsea_clinton.html|year=2005|title=Chelsea Clinton|publisher=Hillary-Rodham-Clinton.org|accessdate=August 6, 2010|url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810145800/http://www.hillary-rodham-clinton.org/chelsea_clinton.html|archive-date=August 10, 2013}}</ref> and she continued her dance training at the Washington School of Ballet for several years.

In early 1999, the Clintons learned of an article being planned by ''[[People Magazine|People]]'' that examined the First Family's relationships in the wake of scandals and the impending vote on President Clinton's impeachment. The [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] told the magazine they had concerns that the story could compromise Chelsea's security. ''People'' decided to run the story anyway, and Bill and Hillary issued a statement expressing their regret and sadness. Carol Wallace, ''People''{{'}}s managing editor, affirmed the magazine's sensitivity to the Clintons' concerns but felt 19-year-old Chelsea was "an eyewitness to family drama and historical events" and thus "a valid journalistic subject". The article, entitled "Grace Under Fire", was published in February 1999 with a cover photo of Chelsea and Hillary.<ref name="coverstory">{{cite news |last=King, John|date=February 5, 1999|title=Secret Service Concerned over Chelsea Clinton Cover Story|publisher=CNN|url=https://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/02/05/chelsea.clinton.01/|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}</ref>

==Education and academic life==
===Stanford University===

[[File:Chelsea Clinton 1997.jpg|thumb|upright|Clinton in 1997|alt=]]

Clinton entered [[Stanford University]] in the fall of 1997 and majored in history.<ref name="NYT073007"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Chiang|first=Harriet|title=Stanford graduation for Chelsea Clinton|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Stanford-graduation-for-Chelsea-Clinton-History-2907469.php|accessdate=March 7, 2012|newspaper=San Francisco Gate|date=June 18, 2001}}</ref> 

The week before she arrived on campus, her mother published an open letter in her syndicated column asking journalists to leave her daughter alone. Chelsea arrived at Stanford in a motorcade with her parents, Secret Service agents, and almost 250 journalists. For her security, bullet-proof glass was installed in her dorm windows and surveillance cameras were placed in hallways. Secret Service agents in plain clothes lived in her dorm.<ref name="SteinTumulty">{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,987056-1,00.html|author1=Stein, Joel|author2=Tumulty, Karen|date=September 29, 1997|title=Don't Look, It's Chelsea Clinton|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}</ref> With the exception of an occasional tabloid story written about her, Chelsea's four years at Stanford remained out of public view.<ref name="Purdum"/>

===University of Oxford===

Starting on 2001, Chelsea pursued a master's degree at [[University College, Oxford|University College]] of the [[University of Oxford]] where her father had studied politics as a [[Rhodes Scholar]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/1441248.stm |date=July 21, 2001|title=Chelsea Clinton heads for Oxford|work=BBC News|accessdate=August 4, 2010}}</ref> [[Lord Butler of Brockwell]], the [[Master of University College]], said: "Her record at Stanford shows that she is a very well-qualified and able student.

Upon the recommendation of British and American advisers, the university implemented security measures,<ref name="Oxfd">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/1572756.stm|date=October 1, 2001|title=Chelsea Clinton Arrives in Oxford|work=BBC News|accessdate=August 4, 2010}}</ref> and fellow students were asked not to discuss her with the press.<ref name="Lyall">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/31/style/britain-is-becoming-chelsea-clinton-finds.html?pagewanted=all|author=Lyall, Sarah|date=March 31, 2002|title=Britain Is Becoming, Chelsea Clinton Finds|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 4, 2010}}</ref>

Arriving at Oxford just after the [[September 11 attacks]], Clinton was drawn to other American students who were also feeling the emotional after-effects of the trauma. She told ''[[Talk (magazine)|Talk magazine]]'':<blockquote>Every day I encounter some sort of anti-American feeling. Over the summer, I thought I would seek out non-Americans as friends, just for diversity's sake. Now I find that I want to be around Americans—people who I know are thinking about our country as much as I am.<ref name="Lyall"/></blockquote>

Clinton was criticized for those remarks in the London press and by the newspaper ''[[Oxford Student]]'', whose editorial attacking her angered the university. However, people who met Clinton at that time described her as charming, poised and unaffected, as she adjusted successfully to life abroad.<ref name="Lyall"/>

At Oxford University in 2003, Clinton completed a [[Master of Philosophy]] degree in [[international relations]].<ref name="OxfordGrad">{{cite web |title=Chelsea faces finals test|url=https://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/6574693.chelsea-faces-finals-test/|work=Oxford Mail (UK)|date=June 18, 2003|accessdate=August 5, 2010}}</ref> Her 132-page thesis was titled ''The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria: A Response to Global Threats, a Part of a Global Future'', supervised by [[Jennifer Welsh]] and [[Ngaire Woods]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria: a response to global threats, a part of a global future|last=Clinton|first=Chelsea|date=2003|publisher=[[University of Oxford]]|oclc= 54042709}}</ref> Following her graduation, she returned to the United States.<ref name="NYT073007"/>
