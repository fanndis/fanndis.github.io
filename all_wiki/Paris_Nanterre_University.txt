'''Paris Nanterre University''' (French: ''Université Paris Nanterre''), formerly called "'''Paris X Nanterre'''" and more recently "'''Université Paris Ouest Nanterre La Défense'''", is a French university in the [[List of public universities in France by academy#Academy of Versailles|Academy of Versailles]]. It is one of the most prestigious French universities, mainly in the areas of law, humanities, political science, social and natural sciences and economics. It is one of the thirteen successor universities of the [[University of Paris]]. It is located in the western suburb of [[Nanterre]], in the [[La Défense]] area, the business district of [[Paris]]. The university is commonly referred to as '''Nanterre'''.

== History ==
[[File:Nanterre-250x188.jpg|left|thumb|Ths Social Sciences buildings]]
Nanterre was built in the 1960s on the outskirts of [[Paris]] as an extension of the Sorbonne. It was set up as an independent university in December 1970. Based on the [[Higher education in the United States|American]] model, it was created as a [[campus]] (as opposed to the old French universities which were smaller and integrated with the city in which they were located).

Nanterre became famous shortly after its opening by being at the center of the [[French May|May '68 student rebellion]]. The campus was nicknamed "Nanterre, la folle" (Mad Nanterre) or "Nanterre la rouge" (Red Nanterre, in reference to communism).

== Size and scope ==
Nanterre is the second largest campus in France after [[Nantes]], with its own Olympic-sized swimming pool and a stadium. It welcomes 35,000 to 40,000 students every year in all fields of studies: [[Social Sciences]], [[Philosophy]], [[Literature]], [[History]], Languages and [[Linguistics]], [[Economics]], [[Law]] and [[Political Sciences]], as well as Teacher Training, [[Acting]], [[Film|Cinema]], [[Physiology]] and [[Sports]].

The university is renowned in the fields of Law and Economics. Even though French universities are required by law to admit anyone with a [[Baccalauréat]], strain is put on the students from the start and the first year drop-out rate consistently hovers in the 60% region. At the postgraduate level, the university offers very competitive programs (highly selective master's degrees in Law and Business) and partnerships with some [[grandes écoles]] such as the [[Ecole Polytechnique]], [[ESSEC]], [[Ecole des Mines]] de Paris, and [[ESCP Europe]] among others.

The Rene Ginouves Institute for Archaeology and Anthropology (Maison de l'archeologie et de l'ethnologie Rene Ginouves) is another important institution on campus, merging the departments of the [[CNRS]], [[University of Paris I: Panthéon-Sorbonne|Paris I-Panthéon Sorbonne]] and Paris X-Nanterre.

As in most Parisian universities, there is a large minority of foreign exchange students.

== Innovative programs ==
Over the years, Nanterre has developed innovative programs such as the double bilingual courses in French Law and Anglo-American, Spanish, Russian, German or Italian law; in Economics & Management (with half of the courses in French and half of the courses in another foreign language); and in History (with half of the courses in French and half of the courses in another foreign language). These programs have inspired many universities and grandes écoles throughout the country and are now renowned on a national level.{{cn|date=April 2020}}
