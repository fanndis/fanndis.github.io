'''Kenneth "Kenny" Wright MacAskill''' (born 28 April 1958) is a Scottish politician who has been [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[East Lothian (UK Parliament constituency)|East Lothian]] since [[2019 United Kingdom general election in Scotland|2019]]. He was a [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for the [[Lothians (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Lothians]] region from [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999]] to [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007]], the [[Edinburgh East and Musselburgh (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh East and Musselburgh]] constituency from 2007 to [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011]] and the [[Edinburgh Eastern (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Eastern]] constituency from 2011 to [[2016 Scottish Parliament election|2016]]. A member of the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), he was [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice]] from 2007 until 2014.

MacAskill studied law at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and worked as a [[solicitor]] and was a senior partner in an [[Edinburgh]] law firm, before being elected as an MSP in 1999. He was a long-standing member of the SNP's National Executive Committee and has served as National Treasurer and Vice Convener of Policy. He was convener of the [[Scottish Parliament]] Subordinate Legislation Committee (1999–2001), and served in the SNP [[Shadow Cabinet]] as [[Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning|Shadow Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning]] (2001–2003), [[Minister for Transport and Islands|Shadow Minister for Transport and Telecommunications]] (2003–2004) and [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice|Shadow Minister for Justice]] (2004–2007).

Following the SNP's victory in the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 Scottish Parliament Election]], MacAskill was appointed as Cabinet Secretary for Justice in the [[Scottish Government]]. In this role, he oversaw the controversial transfer of convicted terrorist [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]] to his native [[Libya]]. MacAskill left office in November 2014 in the Cabinet reshuffle which followed the appointment of [[Nicola Sturgeon]] as [[First Minister of Scotland]].

At the [[2019 United Kingdom general election in Scotland|December 2019 general election]], MacAskill was returned as MP for [[East Lothian (UK Parliament constituency)|East Lothian]], gaining the previously Labour-held seat from [[Martin Whitfield]].

== Background, early life and career ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2011}}
MacAskill was born in [[Edinburgh]] and was educated at [[Linlithgow Academy]] before studying law at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. After completing his training at a firm in Glasgow, he set up Erskine MacAskill.

He came to prominence inside the SNP through his activities in the [[Left-wing politics|left wing]] [[79 Group]] and became a party office bearer.  In the 1980s he led the "Can't Pay, Won't Pay" campaign in opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Poll Tax]].  It was widely known that he often disagreed politically with [[Alex Salmond]], leader of the SNP through the 1990s, and he was at one stage viewed as belonging to the [[SNP Fundamentalist]] camp, being perceived to be allied to figures such as [[Jim Sillars]] and [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]] within the party.

== Member of the Scottish Parliament (1999–2016) ==
After MacAskill became on MSP in 1999 upon the establishment of the [[Scottish Parliament]] as a regional list member for the [[Lothians (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Lothians]] he moderated his political position, seeing the development of the Scottish Parliament as the most achievable route for Scotland to become an independent nation state. In this respect he was regarded as having adopted a [[SNP Gradualist|gradualist]] approach to [[Scottish independence]] in place of his previous fundamentalist position. He was one of former SNP leader [[John Swinney]]'s closest supporters.

In 1999 MacAskill was detained in [[London]] before the [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]] second leg play-off match between Scotland and England on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/535592.stm |title=Arrest incident 'closed', insists SNP |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=25 November 1999}}</ref> As he was not charged with any crime the incident did not affect his position within the SNP and he won re-election at the [[2003 Scottish Parliament election|2003 election]].

In 2004, after [[John Swinney]] stood down as SNP party leader, Kenny MacAskill backed the joint leadership ticket of Alex Salmond and [[Nicola Sturgeon]]. He had initially intended to stand for deputy leader himself on a joint ticket with [[Nicola Sturgeon]], who would have sought the leadership. He gave way when Salmond reconsidered his earlier decision not to seek re-election to the leadership. Upon their election as leader and deputy leader respectively MacAskill was selected to be the SNP's deputy leader in the Scottish Parliament, making him the shadow Deputy First Minister.

MacAskill authored a book, 'Building a Nation – Post Devolution Nationalism in Scotland', which was launched at the SNP's 2004 annual conference in Inverness. He has since edited another book 'Agenda for a New Scotland – Visions of Scotland 2020' and has co-authored 'Global Scots – Voices From Afar' with former First Minister [[Henry McLeish]].

=== Cabinet Secretary for Justice (2007–2014) ===
For the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election]] MacAskill was top of the SNP's party list for the Lothians region. He stood in the [[Edinburgh East and Musselburgh (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh East and Musselburgh]] constituency, winning that seat from the [[Scottish Labour Party]] with a 13.3% swing to give a majority of 1,382. This was the first time the SNP had ever won a parliamentary seat in Edinburgh. After the SNP's victory at the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 Scottish Parliament Election]], MacAskill became the [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice]].

One of MacAskill's first acts as a cabinet secretary was to lift the ban on alcohol sales at international [[rugby union]] games held at [[Murrayfield Stadium]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/rugby/article1907144.ece Murrayfield toasts lifting of drinks ban], ''[[The Times]]'' 9 June 2007</ref>

MacAskill also said that the [[Glasgow Airport Attack|2007 terror attack on Glasgow Airport]] was not committed by 'home-grown' terrorists in that the suspects were not "born or bred" in Scotland but had merely lived in the country for a "period of time".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6258758.stm |title=Terrorists not 'home-grown' |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=BBC |date=1 July 2007}}</ref>

MacAskill won election to a redrawn constituency of [[Edinburgh Eastern (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Eastern]] in the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election]].<ref name = "2011 election"/> Despite notionally facing a deficit of 550 votes,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/mobile/news/home-news/key-holyrood-election-battles-1.1093451|title=Key Holyrood election battles |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|date=30 March 2011|accessdate=7 May 2011|first=Robbie|last=Dinwoodie}}</ref> MacAskill won by over 2000 votes.<ref name = "2011 election">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-13308036|title=Scottish election: SNP changes Edinburgh political map|publisher=BBC News|date=6 May 2011|accessdate=7 May 2011}}</ref>

====Pan Am Flight 103====
{{Main|Release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi}}

On 19 August 2009, MacAskill rejected an application by Libya to transfer to their custody [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]], convicted of the [[Pan Am Flight 103]] bomb that killed 270 people, acknowledging that "the American families and Government had an expectation or were led to believe that there would be no prisoner transfer."<ref>UK Cabinet Office, ''Cabinet Secretary's Review of Papers Relating to the Release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi'' 11 ¶ 31 (7 February 2011) ''available at'' www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/20110207-megrahi-review-report.pdf</ref> MacAskill authorised al-Megrahi's release on compassionate grounds.

John Mosey, a priest who lost a daughter on Pan Am Flight 103, expressed his disappointment that halting Megrahi's appeal before it went to court meant that the public would never hear "this important evidence — the six separate grounds for appeal that the [[Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission|SCCRC]] felt were important enough to put forward, that could show that there’s been a miscarriage of justice."<ref>{{cite news | last = Mackey | first = Robert| title = Lockerbie, the Unanswered Questions |series = News Blog | work = New York Times | date = 21 August 2009 | url = http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/lockerbie-the-unanswered-questions/}}</ref> [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] reiterated his belief in Megrahi's innocence commenting that the Justice Secretary had "made the right decision" and that history would prove this to be the case.<ref name="guardian828">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/aug/28/lockerbie-bomber-saif-gaddafi | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Efforts to release Lockerbie bomber linked with trade, says Gaddafi's son | first=Severin | last=Carrell | date=28 August 2009 | accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> A letter in support of MacAskill's decision was sent to the Scottish Government on behalf of former South African President [[Nelson Mandela]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8229338.stm|title=Mandela backs Lockerbie decision|work=BBC| date=30 August 2009}}</ref>
