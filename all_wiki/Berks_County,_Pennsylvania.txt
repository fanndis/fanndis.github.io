Berks County comprises the Reading, PA [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA), which is also included in the [[Philadelphia]]-Reading-[[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], PA-[[New Jersey|NJ]]-[[Delaware|DE]]-[[Maryland|MD]] [[Delaware Valley|Combined Statistical Area]]. (CSA).

==History==
Reading developed during the 1740s when the inhabitants of northern [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]] sent several petitions requesting that a separate county be established. With the help of German immigrant [[Conrad Weiser]], the county was formed on March 11, 1752, from parts of [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]], [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]], and [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia County]].<ref>''The Statutes at Large of Pennsylvania from 1682-1809'', 18 vols. (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Wm. Stanley Ray, 1898), [https://archive.org/details/statutesatlarge06martgoog vol. 5 1744-1759], pages 133-140, 502-503, Chapter CCCXCII, "An Act for Erecting Part of the Counties Of Philadelphia, Chester and Lancaster into a Separate County," March 11, 1752, confirmed by the King in Council, May 10, 1753, creation of Berks County, digital images, Internet Archive (https://archive.org : July 26, 2018).</ref>

It was named after the English county in which [[William Penn]]'s family home lay, [[Berkshire]], which is often abbreviated to Berks. Berks County began much larger than it is today. The northwestern parts of the county went to the founding of [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania|Northumberland County]] in 1772 and [[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Schuylkill County]] in 1811, when it reached its current size. In 2005, Berks County was added to the [[Delaware Valley]] Planning Area due to a fast-growing population and close proximity to the other communities.

In 2016, former Strausstown borough merged with Upper Tulpehocken township. Strausstown is now a village within Upper Tulpehocken Township.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|866|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|857|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|9.2|sqmi}} (1.1%) is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_42.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=March 5, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref> Most of the county is drained by the [[Schuylkill River]], but an area in the northeast is drained by the [[Lehigh River]] via the [[Little Lehigh Creek]] and areas are drained by the [[Susquehanna River]] via the [[Swatara Creek]] in the northwest and the [[Conestoga River]] (which starts in Berks County between Morgantown and Elverson) in the extreme south. It has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'' except for some ''Dfb'' on [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]] at the northern boundary and on Mount Penn) and the [[hardiness zone]] is mostly 6b with 6a in some higher areas and 7a along the Schuylkill in the SE part of the county.

The first time since 1964 that a Democrat carried Berks in a Presidential election occurred in November 2008, with [[Barack Obama]] receiving 53.9% of the vote to [[John McCain]]'s 44.7%.

In the 2012 Presidential election, [[Mitt Romney]] carried the county by approximately a one-percent margin, 49.6% to 48.6%, however, in 2016, [[Donald Trump]] carried Berks by a much larger margin of 52.9% to 42.7%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.co.berks.pa.us/results/default.aspx|access-date=November 16, 2016|title=Election Results}}</ref>
