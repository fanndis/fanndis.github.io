==Background==
In November 2014, Rihanna released a snippet of a song via her official [[Instagram]] account, the song featured lyrics such as "Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised" and "Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of it certain", whilst the rest of the snippet featured "plinky synths and booming bass providing the only instrumentation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/rihanna-teases-new-track-new-video.31900.html|title=Rihanna Teases New Track [New Video]|publisher=}}</ref> Following the release many assumed that it was a song for Rihanna's then-upcoming eighth studio album ''Anti'' (2016). In July 2015, Mike Will Made It posted a 15-second video clip featuring a snippet of Rihanna singing; in June of the following year he released their collaboration as the lead single from his album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uk/news/769936/mike-will-made-it-and-rihanna-drop-nothing-is-promised|title=Mike WiLL Made-It and Rihanna Drop Nothing Is Promised|publisher=}}</ref>
