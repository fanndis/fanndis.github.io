==Overview==

HSUS formed after a schism surfaced in the [[American Humane Association]] over pound seizure, rodeo, and other policy issues. The incorporators of HSUS included four people—Larry Andrews, Marcia Glaser, Helen Jones, and Fred Myers—all of whom were active in the leadership of existing local and national groups, who would become its first four employees.  They believed that a new kind of organization would strengthen the American humane movement, and they set up HSUS as the "National Humane Society", in Washington, DC to ensure that it could play a strong role in national policy development concerning animal welfare. HSUS's guiding principle was ratified by its national membership in 1956: "The Humane Society of the United States opposes and seeks to prevent all use or exploitation of animals that causes pain, suffering, or fear."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://works.bepress.com/andrew_rowan/9/ |title=A Social History of Postwar Animal Protection |first1=Bernard |last1=Unti  |display-authors=etal|work=BePress.com |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>Unti, Bernard; Protecting All Animals: A Fifty-year History of the Humane Society of the United States (2004), ''idem.''</ref><ref>Swallow, W.; ''The Quality of Mercy: History of the Humane Movement in the United States'', Boston (1962); p. 165.</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/us/john-a-hoyt-dies-guided-humane-society-to-prominence.html?_r=0 |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Paul |last=Vitello |title=John A.

==Rationale==
The values that shaped HSUS's formation in 1954, came in some degree from the humane movement that originated in the 1860s in the United States. The idea of kindness to animals made significant inroads in American culture in the years following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The development of sympathy for creatures in pain, the satisfaction of keeping them as pets, and the heightening awareness about the relationship between [[cruelty to animals]] and [[interpersonal violence]] strengthened the movement's popular appeal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grier |first=Katherine C. |title=Pets in America: A History |date=2007 |publisher=Harcourt |location=Orlando, Florida |isbn=9780156031769 |pages=192–197 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NDmkz1-KLnUC&q=Pets%20in%20America%20grier&pg=PA192 |edition=1st Harvest}}</ref>
[[File:Albert Schweitzer 1952.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Albert Schweitzer]]
The most immediate philosophical influence on 1950s-era advocates, including those associated with HSUS, was the reverence-for-life concept advanced by [[Albert Schweitzer]]. Schweitzer included a deep regard for nonhuman animals in his canon of beliefs, and animal advocates laboring to give their concerns a higher profile were buoyed by Schweitzer's 1952 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] speech, in which he noted that "compassion, in which ethics takes root, does not assume its true proportions until it embraces not only man but every living being."<ref>Unti, Protecting All Animals, 16.</ref>

Myers and his colleagues found another exemplar of their values in [[Joseph Wood Krutch]] (1893–1970), whose writings reflected a deep level of appreciation for wilderness and for nonhuman life. With ''The Great Chain of Life'' (1957), Krutch established himself as a philosopher of humaneness, and in 1970, HSUS' highest award was renamed in his honor.<ref>Unti, Protecting All Animals, 17.</ref>

The growing environmental movement of the early 1970s also influenced the ethical and practical evolution of HSUS. The burgeoning crisis of pollution and wildlife-habitat loss made the public increasingly aware that humans needed to change their behavior toward other living things. By that time, too, the treatment of animals had become a topic of serious discussion within moral philosophy.

The debate spilled over into public consciousness with the publication of [[Peter Singer]]'s ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975). Singer's book sought to recast concern for animals as a justice-based cause like the movements for [[civil rights]] and [[women's rights]].<ref name="ReferenceB">P. Singer, Animal Liberation: New York, 1975</ref>

Most of what Singer wrote concerning the prevention or reduction of animals' suffering was in harmony with HSUS's objectives. Singer's philosophy did not rest upon the [[animal rights|rights of animals]], and he specifically rejected the framework of rights in favor of a utilitarian assessment that focused on animal sentience. His principal concern, like that of HSUS, was the mitigation and elimination of suffering, and he endorsed the view that ethical treatment sometimes permitted or even required killing animals to end their misery.<ref name="ReferenceB" /><ref>Unti, Protecting All Animals, 18.</ref>

The 1980s witnessed a flourishing of concern about animals and a proliferation of new organizations, many influenced by the [[Animal liberation movement|emergence of a philosophy]] holding that animals had inherent rights. Those committed to the [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|purest form of animal rights]] rejected any human use of animals. In this changing context,  HSUS faced new challenges. As newer animal organizations adopted more [[direct action|radical approaches]] to achieve their goals, the organization born in anti-establishment politics now found itself identified – and sometimes criticized – as the "establishment" group of record.<ref>Unti, Bernard; ''Protecting All Animals: A Fifty-year History of the Humane Society of the United States'' (2004).</ref>

==History==
In 1954, HSUS's founders decided to create a new kind of animal organization, based in the nation's capital, to confront national cruelties beyond the reach of local societies and state federations. Humane slaughter became an immediate priority and commanded a substantial portion of the organization's resources. Myers and his colleagues also viewed this first campaign as a vehicle for promoting movement cohesion.

===Humane slaughter legislation===
In 1958, the [[Humane Methods of Slaughter Act]] passed, which required the proper use of humane slaughter methods at slaughterhouses subject to federal inspection.<ref name="Evans">{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Kim |title=Animal Rights |date=2009 |publisher=Gale |location=Detroit |isbn=978-1414433691 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781414433691 }}</ref> Only four years after HSUS's formation, Myers pointed out that the movement had united, for the first time in eighty-five years,<ref name="Evans" /> to achieve enactment of federal legislation that would affect the lives of tens of millions of animals. He was encouraged that "hundreds of local societies could lift their eyes from local problems to a great national cruelty."<ref name=myers />

===Regulation of experimentation upon animals===
HSUS also made the use of animals in research, testing, and education an early focus. In the post–[[World War II]] era, an increasingly assertive [[biomedical research]] community sought to obtain animals from pounds and shelters handling municipal animal control contracts. Local humane societies across the nation resisted. HSUS sought to bolster the movement's strong opposition to pound seizure, believing that no public pound or privately operated humane society should be compelled by law to provide animals for experimental use.<ref>Protecting All Animals, 64–65.</ref>

HSUS took the position that [[animal experimentation]] should be regulated, and in the 1950s it placed investigators in laboratories to gather evidence of substandard conditions and animal suffering and neglect.<ref>Animals in a Research Laboratory: Washington, DC, 1961</ref> The HSUS was not an anti-[[vivisection]] society, Myers explained in 1958. Rather, it stood for the principle that "every humane society … should be actively concerned about the treatment accorded to such a vast number of animals."<ref name=myers />

Beginning in the 1990s, HSUS board member David O. Wiebers, a medical doctor associated with the [[Mayo Clinic]], undertook efforts to lessen tensions between animal protection organizations and the scientific community, and to seek to identify areas of common agreement.<ref name="D.Wiebers 1992">D.Wiebers, "Vision of a New Era", HSUS News Winter 1992, 9.</ref>

===Companion animals and shelters===

Service to local animal shelters, with a special focus on solving problems and challenges of importance to every one of the nation's humane societies, was an early priority for HSUS.  Its first brochure, "They Preach Cruelty", focused on the tragedy of animal overpopulation.<ref>Unti, Protecting All Animals, 86.</ref> HSUS and its state branches operated animal shelters in Waterford, Virginia, Salt Lake City Utah, and Boulder, Colorado, and elsewhere, during the 1960s, and part of the 1970s.<ref name="ReferenceC">Unti, Protecting All Animals, 87–90, 182–183.</ref> From the early 1960s onward, HSUS worked to promote the most humane methods possible for euthanasia of animals in shelters, using its Waterford, Virginia animal shelter as a model for best practices in this area.<ref>Unti, Protecting All Animals, 88, 90, 97–99.</ref>  HSUS does not currently operate any Animal Shelters.

Under Phyllis Wright, HSUS was a driving force behind the shift to use of sodium pentobarbital for animal euthanasia,  in opposition to the use of gas chambers and decompression,  the standard shelter killing methods until the early 1980s.<ref name="animals24-7.org">{{cite web |url= http://www.animals24-7.org/2014/07/31/nathan-winograd-in-perspective/ |title=Nathan Winograd in perspective |first=Merritt |last=Clifton |work=Animals 24-7 |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref>
 
In 1984, a [[General Accounting Office]] report confirmed HSUS allegations of major problems with puppy mills in the United States, setting the stage for proposed legislation to regulate mills in the 1990s.<ref>Unti, Protecting All Animals, 101–102.</ref>

===Exposure of cruelty in the dog trade===
In 1961, HSUS investigator Frank McMahon launched a probe of dog dealers around the country to generate support for a federal law to prevent cruelty to animals destined for use in laboratories. The five-year investigation into the multilayered trade in dogs paid off in February 1966 when ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' published a [[photo-essay]] of a raid conducted on a Maryland dog dealer's premises by McMahon and the state police.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hsus.org/about_us/accomplishments/the_people_who_have_shaped_the_hsus/frank_mcmahon_the_investigator_who_took_a_bite_out_of_animal_lab_suppliers.html |title=Frank McMahon: The Investigator Who Took a Bite Out of Animal Lab Suppliers |first=Bernard |last=Unti |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181403/http://www.hsus.org/about_us/accomplishments/the_people_who_have_shaped_the_hsus/frank_mcmahon_the_investigator_who_took_a_bite_out_of_animal_lab_suppliers.html |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |access-date=April 19, 2011 |quote=The conditions that shocked the troopers were all too familiar to the man who led them on to Brown's property, Frank McMahon (1926–1975), HSUS director of field services. |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Wayman |first=Stan |date=February 4, 1966 |title=Concentration Camps for Dogs |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |volume=60 |issue=5 |pages=22–29 |access-date=April 19, 2011 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JkwEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Concentration+camps+for+dogs%22&pg=PA22 |quote=The raid was at the behest of the Humane Society of the United States, which, in its constant surveillance of places like Brown's around the country, had sent one of its agents to check conditions at Brown's twice within the past year}}</ref> The ''Life'' spread sparked outrage, and tens of thousands of Americans wrote to their congressional representatives, demanding action to protect animals and prevent pet theft. That summer the [[U.S. Congress]] approved the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act (later renamed the "[[Animal Welfare Act of 1966]]"), only the second major federal humane law passed since World War II.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hsus.org/about_us/accomplishments/history/concentration_camp_for_pets.html |title='Concentration Camps for Lost and Stolen Pets': Stan Wayman's LIFE photo essay and the Animal Welfare Act |first=Bernard |last=Unti |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930183524/http://www.hsus.org/about_us/accomplishments/history/concentration_camp_for_pets.html |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |access-date=April 19, 2011 |quote=...sparked a public outrage that had a catalytic effect, breaking through the political impasse that had seen one animal welfare bill after another fail in the U.S. Congress. |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Goals and expansion===
Other broad goals during this time included a reduction in the U.S.'s homeless dog and cat population, the reform of inhumane [[euthanasia]] practices, and to regulate pet shops and to end the commercial pet breeding trade. HSUS and its state branches operated animal shelters in Waterford, Virginia, Salt Lake City Utah, and Boulder, Colorado, and elsewhere, during the 1960s, and part of the 1970s.<ref name="ReferenceC" />  Today, HSUS operates five animal sanctuaries in the states of California, Florida Massachusetts, Oregon, and Texas.<ref>{{cite web |first=Chuck |last=Jolley |url=http://www.cattlenetwork.com/cattle-news/183412221.html?view=all |title=Jolley: Five minutes with Wayne Pacelle and HumaneWatch |work=CattleNetwork.com |date=December 13, 2012 |access-date=July 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006085156/http://www.cattlenetwork.com/cattle-news/183412221.html?view=all |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

HSUS also worked, from the 1960s, to promote humane education of children in the schools.  Much of this work was carried out under the auspices of an affiliate, the National Association for the Advancement of Humane Education.  In the 1980s, HSUS sponsored several validation studies designed to demonstrate the value of [[humane education]].<ref>"Mom, Apple Pie ... and Humane Education", ''Humane Education'' (March 1983), pp. 7–9</ref><ref>Ascione, F.; ''Children and Animals: Exploring the Roots of Kindness and Cruelty'' (2005), Purdue University Press; p. ix.</ref>

===Relationship to animal rights===
While HSUS welcomed and benefited from growing social interest in animals, it did not originally embrace the language and philosophy of animal rights. Rather, HSUS representatives expressed their beliefs that animals were "entitled to humane treatment and to equal and fair consideration."<ref>Unti, Protecting All Animals, 27.</ref> Like many of the organizations and individuals associated with humane work, HSUS did try to come to terms with the shift toward rights-based language and arguments. In 1978, attorneys Robert Welborn and Murdaugh Stuart Madden<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/about/history/murdaugh_madden.html |title=Murdaugh Stuart Madden: A Half Century's Service, A Lasting Legacy |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |work=HumaneSociety.org |date=January 14, 2008 |access-date=July 14, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092016/http://www.humanesociety.org/about/history/murdaugh_madden.html |archive-date=October 6, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> conducted a workshop at the HSUS annual conference, "Can Animal Rights Be Legally Defined?", and assembled constituents passed a resolution to the effect that "animals have the right to live and grow under conditions that are comfortable and reasonably natural... animals that are used by man in any way have the right to be free from abuse, pain, and torment caused or permitted by man... animals that are domesticated or whose natural environment is altered by man have the right to receive from man adequate food, shelter, and care."<ref>''The Humane Society News'' (Winter 1979), pp. 16–19</ref> In 1980 the notion of rights surfaced in an HSUS convention resolution which, noting that "such rights naturally evolve from long accepted doctrines of justice or fairness or some other dimension of morality", called for "pursuit on all fronts... the clear articulation and establishment of the rights of animals"<ref>Humane Society News (Winter 1981), 25</ref>

In 1986,  HSUS employee John McArdle declared that "HSUS is definitely shifting in the direction of animal rights faster than anyone would realize from our literature".<ref>John McArdle, quoted in Katie McCabe, "Who Will Live, Who Will Die", ''Washingtonian'', August 1986, p. 115, as cited in ''The Humane Society in the US: It's Not About Animal Shelters'', Daniel Oliver</ref>  The HSUS fired McArdle shortly thereafter, he alleged, for being an "animal rights activist".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/1990/11/27/Archive/Prof-Threatened.With.Libel.Suit-2183364.shtml |title=Prof threatened with libel suit |work=The Daily Pennsylvanian |date=November 27, 1990 |access-date=March 30, 2011}}{{dead link |date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> At about the same time, former HSUS president John Hoyt stated that "this new [animal rights] philosophy has served as a catalyst in the shaping of our own philosophies, policies, and goals."<ref>John Hoyt, quoted in Katie McCabe, "Katie McCabe Replies", ''Washingtonian'' October 1986, pp. 109-110, as cited in ''The Humane Society in the US: It's Not About Animal Shelters'', Daniel Oliver</ref>

===Position against the use of violence===

Since 1990 at least, HSUS has expressed a clear opposition to "the use of threats and acts of violence against people and willful destruction and theft of property."<ref>"Joint Resolutions for the 1990s", HSUS News Spring 1991, 1.</ref><ref>M.

In 2018, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported on a Humane Society board investigation conducted by [[Morgan, Lewis & Bockius]] into allegations of sexual harassment involving Wayne Pacelle. The investigation found three credible accusations of sexual harassment and female leaders who said their "warnings about his conduct went unheeded."<ref>{{cite news |last=Paquette |first=Danielle |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/humane-society-ceo-is-subject-of-sexual-harassment-complaints-from-three-women-according-to-internal-investigation/2018/01/29/12c8961e-053b-11e8-94e8-e8b8600ade23_story.html |title=Humane Society CEO is subject of sexual harassment complaints from three women, according to internal investigation |work=The Washington Post |date=January 29, 2018 |access-date=February 9, 2018}}</ref> The board voted to keep Pacelle, but after several board members, including author Suzy Welch and philanthropist Marsha Perelman, resigned in protest and high-profile donors revealed they would withhold donations, Pacelle announced his resignation on February 2, 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last=Paquette |first=Danielle |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/humane-society-dismisses-sexual-harassment-complaints-against-ceo-citing-lack-of-credible-evidence/2018/02/02/d5b163c4-083b-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html |title=Humane Society CEO resigns after sexual harassment allegations |work=The Washington Post |date=February 2, 2018 |access-date=February 9, 2018}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, Perelman, along with Kathleen Linehan, returned to the board as Vice Chair and Treasurer, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Opinion-Why-I-Returned-to-the/243199|title=Why I returned to the Board of the Humane Society of the United States|last=Perelman|first=Marsha|date=|website=Chronicle of Philanthropy|access-date=}}</ref>

The HSUS board of directors closed the investigation, declining to take any action, and issued a statement that Morgan, Lewis had found no "credible evidence" that would "support the women's claims," sparking outrage and resulting in the resignation of seven further board members. The organization named as Acting President and interim [[CEO]], [[Kitty Block]], who was President of the international affiliate of the organization, [[Humane Society International]], and who had sued her former HSUS boss, David Wills, for [[sexual harassment]] 20 years ago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a24404112/0162-0174-the-replacements-december-2018/#point7|title=Elle: The Replacements|date=|website=Elle Magazine|access-date=}}</ref> On January 25, 2019, Kitty Block was named official President and CEO of the organization, and Susan Atherton and Thomas J.

===Animal protection litigation section===

HSUS launched an animal protection litigation section in 2005.  The section works with several thousand pro bono attorneys around the country to pursue its docket of cases. Under section leader Jonathan Lovvorn, the animal protection litigation group has won approximately three dozen cases in its first decade of existence, taking a practical approach, which Lovvorn explained in a 2012 interview. "We look at cases that are going to have a concrete impact on animals but are winnable.  You won't see us out asking for courts to declare animals persons. Or to file habeas corpus requests on behalf of animals, or other things that require judges to go way beyond what they're comfortable with." In 2010, the section estimated that it had filed more than 50 legal actions in 25 states, and won 80% of its cases, while booking 10,000 hours of pro bono attorney time for a total in-kind contribution of $4 million.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dcbar.org/bar-resources/publications/washington-lawyer/articles/march-2008-animal-law.cfm |title=Cover Story: Animal Law |work=dcbar.org |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://enviroshop.com/wordpress/?p=12312 |title=Taking Animals to Court: A Q&A with Jonathan Lovvorn and Peter Petersan |work=enviroshop.com |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/02/humane-society-litigation_n_1933863.html |work=Huffington Post |title=How the Humane Society Decides Who to Sue |date=October 2, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animallaw.info/sites/default/files/lralvol12_2_p133.pdf |title=Animal law info |website=www.animallaw.info }}</ref>

===Corporate expansion===
The corporate expansion forged by Pacelle included mergers with The Fund for Animals (2005), founded by social critic and author [[Cleveland Amory]] and the [[Doris Day Animal League]] (2006), founded by screen actress and singer [[Doris Day]]. This made possible the establishment of a separate campaigns department, an equine issues department, a litigation section, the enhancement of signature programs likes Pets for Life<ref>[http://www.humanesociety.org/animal_community/shelters/pets_for_life_nyc.html Pets for Life: Helping Pets in the Big Apple]; Humane Society of the United States; September 22, 2010. {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111007145312/http://www.humanesociety.org/animal_community/shelters/pets_for_life_nyc.html |date=October 7, 2011}}</ref> and Wild Neighbors,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/wild_neighbors/ |title=Wild Neighbors |work=HumaneSociety.org |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |access-date=April 8, 2012}}</ref> and an expanded range of hands-on care programs for animals.<ref>[http://www.humanesociety.org/animal_community/shelters/animal_care_centers.html Animal Care Centers]; Humane Society of the United States; September 14, 2011. {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111016161036/http://www.humanesociety.org/animal_community/shelters/animal_care_centers.html |date=October 16, 2011}}</ref> During the first 2½ years of Pacelle's tenure, overall revenues and expenditures grew by more than 50 percent.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/06/AR2006090601770_pf.html |title=Merger Adds to Humane Society's Bite |work=WashingtonPost.com |date=September 7, 2006 |access-date=March 30, 2011}}</ref>  In early 2008, HSUS re-organized its direct veterinary care work and its veterinary advocacy under a new entity, the Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association, formed through an alliance with the Association of Veterinarians for Animal Rights (AVAR).<ref>{{cite news |title=Humane Society, Veterinarians for Animal Rights Join Forces |url= http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=11165 |work=The Horse |date=January 15, 2008}}</ref>

===Corporate social responsibility outreach===

Engagement with major corporations in an effort to persuade them to press for reforms in their supply chains has been a significant priority for HSUS in the last decade, and as a result of its efforts, more than 60 major food suppliers have used their leverage to change production level practices in the pork industry.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/3385303/companies-spend-more-on-csr-and-shareholders-reward-them.html#.VCyZ5xaRPqx |title=Companies Spend More on CSR and Shareholders Reward them |work=institutionalinvestor.com |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref>

===Hurricane Katrina animal rescue===
In September 2005, when thousands of animals were left behind as people evacuated during [[Hurricane Katrina]], HSUS joined other organizations in a massive search-and-rescue effort that saved approximately ten thousand animals, and raised more than $34 million for direct relief, reconstruction, and recovery in the Gulf Coast region. HSUS led the campaign that culminated in the federal passage of the PETS Act in October 2006, requiring all local, state, and federal agencies to include animals in their disaster planning scenarios.<ref>[http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2006/10/president_bush_signs_PETS_act_100606.html President Bush Signs Bill to Leave No Pet Behind in Disaster Planning and Evacuation]; Humane Society of the United States; October 6, 2006. {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100831131309/http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2006/10/president_bush_signs_PETS_act_100606.html |date=August 31, 2010}}</ref>

===Investigation into "faux" fur===
In late 2006, HSUS broke the story of its investigation into the sale of coats trimmed with real fur but labeled "faux" or fake. Laboratory testing found that the fur came from purpose-bred [[raccoon dog]]s in China that were sometimes beaten to death and skinned alive. The story of fur animals beaten to death and skinned alive is disputed by a fur industry trade group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.furcommission.com/news/newsF08q.htm#Anchor-33869 |title=Chinese Fur Farms: Media Wary of Latest Shock Video |access-date=September 30, 2011 |last=Ward |first=Simon |date=May 25, 2005 |work=furcommission.com |publisher=Fur Commission USA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003131612/http://www.furcommission.com/news/newsF08q.htm#Anchor-33869 |archive-date=October 3, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> The investigation reportedly prompted several retailers including [[Macy's]] and [[J.C.

On March 17, 2009, HSUS launched a class action suit against Petland on behalf of patrons who allegedly purchased sick animals from the chain, under the alleged pretense that the animals had come from the nation's finest breeders.<ref>{{cite web |title=Petland is accused of scheme to sell sick puppies |url= https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090317/ap_on_bi_ge/sick_puppies |access-date=March 18, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090321194657/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090317/ap_on_bi_ge/sick_puppies |archive-date=March 21, 2009}}</ref> On August 8, 2009, the case was dismissed by a [[United States District Judge]] for lack of facts concerning the case.<ref>[http://www.petland.com/PetlandNews/order.pdf Court Order- petland.com] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090902114430/http://www.petland.com/PetlandNews/order.pdf |date=September 2, 2009}}</ref> Petland responded to the dismissal by stating: "The Humane Society of the United States touted the lawsuit in furtherance of its fundraising and media campaign seeking to end the sale of animals through pet stores.

===Political and legislative initiatives against animal abuse and cruelty===

During 2013, HSUS helped to pass 109 animal protection laws at the state level.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.unionvilletimes.com/?p=20436 |title=The Unionville Times » Pa. improves ranking on animal protection |work=unionvilletimes.com |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref>  In 2006, HSUS helped to secure the passage of 70 new state laws on behalf of animals. Two successful November 2006 ballot initiatives conducted with its support outlawed dove hunting in Michigan and, through [[Proposition 204]], abusive livestock-farming practices in Arizona.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/29/AR2007012901861.html |work=The Washington Post |title=The Humane Society Becomes a Political Animal |first=Jeffrey H. |last=Birnbaum |date=January 30, 2007 |access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref>  In 2008, HSUS helped to pass 91 state animal-welfare laws, including [[California Proposition 2 (2008)|Proposition 2]] in California.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.humanesociety.org/about/overview/2008_accomplishments.html |title=Accomplishments in 2008 |work=HumaneSociety.org |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref> HSUS was a leader in the [[California Proposition 2 (2008)|Proposition 2]] campaign in California, which gained eight million votes on Election Day 2008, more than any other initiative on the ballot. The measure, which prohibits certain intensive confinement practices in agriculture beginning in 2015, passed by a 63.3 to 36.7 percent margin, winning in 46 of 58 counties, and gaining support throughout the state's urban, suburban, and rural areas. It garnered votes from Democrats, independents, and Republicans alike, as well as among Caucasians, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Latinos. Nearly 800,000 Californians signed petitions to place the measure on the ballot.<ref>{{cite web |last=Salerno |first=C. |url= http://oaklandnorth.net/2008/11/04/prop-2-on-farm-animals-leading-early-returns/ |title=Prop. 2 passes, farm animals get more room to stretch |work=OaklandNorth.net |date=November 4, 2008 |access-date=March 30, 2011}}</ref>

HSUS was also a participant in a ballot initiative campaign focusing on inhumane treatment of farm animals in Ohio. The livestock-agriculture initiative was withdrawn from the ballot after a compromise was brokered between HSUS, Ohioans for Humane Farms, the Ohio Farm Bureau, and Ohio Governor Ted Strickland.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://agwired.com/2010/06/30/hsus-drops-ballot-initiative-in-ohio/ |title=HSUS Drops Ballot Initiative in Ohio |work=AgWired |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2010/06/landmark_ohio_agreement_063010.html |title=Landmark Ohio Animal Welfare Agreement Reached Among HSUS, Ohioans for Humane Farms, Gov.

HSUS led a campaign against [[puppy mill]] cruelty in Missouri in 2010.  The Puppy Mill Cruelty Prevention Act, known as "Prop B", was narrowly passed by Missouri voters.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sos.mo.gov/enrweb/allresults.asp?eid=300 |title=State of Missouri General Election: November 2, 2010 General Election |publisher=Missouri Secretary of State |date=November 30, 2010 |access-date=April 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110220103631/http://www.sos.mo.gov/enrweb/allresults.asp?eid=300 |archive-date=February 20, 2011}}</ref>

===United Egg Producers===

For several years, HSUS cooperated with the United Egg Producers to secure federal legislation to phase out barren battery cages for all laying hens in the United States. Discussion between HSUS and the [[United Egg Producers]] concerning a national standard for egg production began with a meeting between Jerry Crawford, an Iowa resident with ties to the egg production industry, and HSUS's Wayne Pacelle. Crawford recommended a further meeting with the [[United Egg Producers]]' Chad Gregory.  The context for the meeting was HSUS's commanding win in [[Proposition 2]] in California, and a shared belief that open warfare would serve no one's purposes. Additional negotiations produced the agreement to pursue federal legislation, the Egg Products Inspection Act of 2013, to support a shift to cage-free housing systems for laying hens, like enriched colony cages. The proposal failed in the Congress, and was not taken up in the 2014 Farm Bill, as a result of opposition by livestock production groups concerned over the precedent of federally-mandated standards for housing. Hog producers in particular recognized their vulnerability in reference to gestation crates<ref>[http://www.capitalpress.com/article/20140108/ARTICLE/140109908/1169 Egg bill still alive in Congress].

==Positions and program work==

===Animal fighting===

In July 2007, HSUS led calls for the [[National Football League]] to suspend [[Atlanta Falcons]] quarterback [[Michael Vick]] in the wake of allegations that he had been involved with [[dog fighting]] activity.<ref>[http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2008/11/vick_state_dogfighting_charges_statement_112508.html HSUS Statement on Michael Vick's Sentence Related to State Dogfighting Charges]{{dead link |date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} November 25, 2008</ref> Vick was prosecuted and convicted under state and federal laws.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/11/25/michael-vick-pleads-guilty-to-dogfighting-charges-in-virginia-insuring-early/ |work=Fox News |title=Michael Vick Pleads Guilty to Dogfighting Charges in Virginia, Insuring Early Prison Release |date=November 25, 2008}}</ref> HSUS has backed upgrades of the federal laws concerning animal fighting in 2007, 2008, and in relation to the Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act, from 2011 to the present.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/08/nation/la-na-nn-animal-fight-spectors-law-20130607 |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Richard |last=Simon |title=Animal-fight spectators face stiff penalties under proposed law |date=June 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=August 26, 2013 |url= http://www.southeastsun.com/news/article_5e0118dc-0e6d-11e3-b200-001a4bcf6878.html |title=Multi-state investigation leads to dog-fighting arrests in county |work=The Southeast Sun |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>

===Animals in research, testing, and education===

Beginning in the 1990s, HSUS board member David O. Wiebers, a medical doctor associated with the [[Mayo Clinic]], undertook efforts to lessen tensions between animal protection organizations and the scientific community, and to seek to identify areas of common agreement.<ref name="D.Wiebers 1992" />
The announcement by the NIH that it would no longer fund experiments that relied on Class B dealers marked the end of a long campaign by HSUS and other organizations to halt this channel for the supply of animals<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.sciencemag.org/policy/2014/10/nih-ends-funding-experiments-using-random-source-dogs?rss=1 |title=NIH ends funding for experiments using 'random source' dogs |work=sciencemag.org |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref>

In 2013, HSUS worked closely with the [[Arcus Foundation]] and other partners in the successful effort to persuade the U.S. government to transfer the remaining chimpanzees it owns to sanctuary over time, and for an end to chimpanzee use in research, testing, and education.<ref>[http://www.arcusfoundation.org/conservation/newsroom/all_news/arcus_welcomes_us_agency_decision_to_release_lab_chimps/ "Arcus Welcomes U.S. Agency Decision to Release Lab Chimps"], Arcus Foundation; June 27, 2013. {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140203003154/http://www.arcusfoundation.org/conservation/newsroom/all_news/arcus_welcomes_us_agency_decision_to_release_lab_chimps/ |date=February 3, 2014}}</ref> Since 2007, HSUS has pressed corporations still using chimpanzees in research to commit to policies of non-use.  In 2011, the [[Institute of Medicine]], part of the [[United States National Academies]], recommended the curtailment of chimp use in testing. The IOM said that while genetic similarity made chimps valuable for medical research, such research raised ethical issues and carried a "moral cost." In 2014, Merck, the world's third largest pharmaceutical company, became the largest multinational corporation to make such a commitment.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://abcnews.go.com/m/story?id=22304747 |title=Merck Joins Companies Ending Chimpanzee Research |work=ABCNews.Go.com |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company]] / [[Yahoo]] |date=January 30, 2014 |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20140130-716361.html |work=The Wall Street Journal |title=Merck Ends Use of Chimpanzees in Research}}</ref>

===Animals used for food===

====Basic policy====
HSUS opposes cruelty in the raising and slaughter of animals used for food, and has done so since its inception in 1954.  HSUS's policy of the 3 Rs encourages its constituents to reduce their consumption of meat and to choose products from humanely raised animals instead of factory farm products.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bigstory.ap.org/article/actor-james-cromwell-feted-hsus-hollywood-gala |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 29, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141031231224/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/actor-james-cromwell-feted-hsus-hollywood-gala |archive-date=October 31, 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.humanesociety.org/about/policy_statements/statement_farm_animals_eating.html Statement on Farm Animals and Eating with Conscience ] July 16, 2009</ref>

HSUS has convinced hundreds of the [https://fortune.com/2015/04/09/humane-society-food-companies-negotiation/ largest grocery and restaurant companies] to enact reforms regarding their treatment of farm animals.  The organization also collaborates with food service companies and institutions to offer more plant-based meals, stating that in [https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/HSUS_2019_AnnualReport.pdf 2019] it trained more than 10,000 food service professionals.

HSUS believes that, in general, wild animals are not suitable as pets, and opposes the general traffic in wild animals.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.humanesociety.org/about/policy_statements/statement_wild_animals.html?credit=web_id94248401 |title=Statement on Wild Animals |work=humanesociety.org |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref>

===Puppy mills===

HSUS has been an active opponent of the domestic and global [[puppy mill]] industry, and helped law enforcement agencies to confiscate more than 35,000 animals from purported puppy mills since 2007. HSUS has also pressed anti-puppy mill bills in states like Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas.  The number of dog breeders licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture declined from 3,486 in 2009 to 2,205 in 2011.<ref name="animalpeoplenews">{{cite web |work=AnimalPeopleNews.org |title=2013 Animal People Watchdog Report, 18 |url= http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/watchdog_report.html |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140907060407/http://www.animalpeoplenews.org/watchdog_report.html |archive-date=September 7, 2014}}</ref>

HSUS led the effort to secure adoption of a [[United States Department of Agriculture]] rule to prohibit the importation into the United States of dogs from foreign countries for resale unless the animals were in good health, vaccinated and at least 6 months old.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-overseas-puppy-mills-law-20140815-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Overseas puppy mills: A good new rule to stem a cruel business |date=August 16, 2014}}</ref>

===Wildlife===

HSUS opposes the hunting of any living creature for fun, trophy, or sport. HSUS only supports killing animals for population control when carried out by officials and does not oppose hunting for food or subsistence needs.<ref name=hunting>{{cite web |url= http://www.humanesociety.org/about/policy_statements/statement_wild_animals.html#Hunting |title=Wild Animals: Hunting Section |work=HumaneSociety.org |date=July 16, 2009 |access-date=August 26, 2012}}</ref>  As a practical matter, HSUS has generally campaigned against abuses found in the treatment of wildlife.  Its ballot initiatives focus on things like shooting bear over bait, hunting with hounds, and other forms of hunting the organization believes are unsporting.

Together with its global affiliate, [[Humane Society International]], HSUS has waged a decade-long fight to end the Canadian seal hunt.  In late 2013, the [[World Trade Organization]] upheld the [[European Union]] ban on trade in products of commercial seal hunts, rejecting the Canadian and Norwegian challenge.<ref>November 25, 2013.

The [[United States Association of Reptile Keepers]] (USARK) is a [[501(c)(6)]] organization that lobbies on behalf of the [[Herpetoculture|captive-bred reptiles]] industry, which is made up of both pet owners and professional breeders, as well as supporting zoos and sanctuaries.<ref>[http://usark.org/about/ "The Reptile Nation"]</ref> USARK has argued against a national ban that HSUS has lobbied for since its writing in 2009, which was originally intended to ban the import and interstate transport of nine [[Constriction|constrictor]] snake species.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bigcatrescue.org/senate-panel-approves-large-constrictor-snake-trade-ban/ |title=Senate Panel Approves Large Constrictor Snake Trade Ban |work=Big Cat Rescue |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref> However, due to pressure from the reptile keepers association, the U.S. government lessened the ban to include only four of the original nine species. As a response, Wayne Pacelle wrote on his blog in response that "these large constricting snakes are not suitable as pets", continuing with "they suffer from capture in the wild and long-distance transport for trade; they can injure and kill people who possess or interact with them; and they can wreak havoc on our natural resources as an invasive species, killing native wildlife, including endangered animals."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.humanesociety.org/2012/01/constrictor-snake-news.html|title=The Way Washington Works|date=January 17, 2012|website=A Humane World|language=en-US|access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref>

In the summer of 2014, the [[USFWS|United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] reopened its admission of comments on whether to list the five remaining species of snakes on the Lacey Act, including [[Boa constrictor]]s. The HSUS then called upon its proponents to send in replies and letters to support further restriction of the trade in the reptiles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.humanesociety.org/2014/06/constrictor-snakes-2.html|title=Time to Tighten Grip on Imports of Constricting Snakes|date=June 24, 2014|website=A Humane World|language=en-US|access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref> In response, USARK has accused the HSUS of directly telling its advocates to lie to the U.S. government: the reptile keepers association stating on their website that "HSUS President Wayne Pacelle is even asking HSUS followers to join in and lie to the U.S. Government by sending their sample letter." They continue their argument with "Their deceptive campaign continues because there is not valid, peer-reviewed science to support their claims. They lack credible arguments and instead focus on sensationalized propaganda."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://usark.org/2014-blog/hsus-wants-americans-to-lie-to-the-u-s-government/|title=HSUS wants Americans to Lie to the U.S. Government {{!}} USARK|language=en-US|access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref> HSUS has always been against the keeping of snakes in captivity, stating that they are a "threat to public safety" and that the welfare of the snakes themselves are at risk, as they "[require] specialized expertise and care."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/exotic_pets/facts/dangerous-exotic-pets-constrictor-snakes.html |title=Dangerous Exotic Pets: Snakes |work=humanesociety.org |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref>
The HSUS is also against the keeping of other reptiles in captivity, such as turtles<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.humanesociety.org/news/thinking-getting-pet-turtle|title=Thinking of getting a pet turtle?|website=The Humane Society of the United States|language=en|access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref> and iguanas,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/iguanas/ |title=Iguanas |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |work=HumaneSociety.org |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref> which is in direct opposition of USARK's interests.<ref>[http://usark.org/position-statements/mission/ usark.org Mission statement]</ref>

==Specific criticism==

===Allegations of misappropriation of donations for Hurricane Katrina rescues===
In 2006, the [[Attorney General of Louisiana]] opened an inquiry into the [[American Red Cross]] and HSUS after complaints about the misuse of funds raised in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Salmon |first=Jacqueline L. |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/25/AR2006032501002.html |title=Red Cross, Humane Society Under Investigation |work=The Washington Post |date=March 26, 2006 |access-date=April 8, 2012}}</ref> This inquiry was part of a wide-ranging effort to ensure that charities providing relief for the victims of the hurricane did not profit from the incident.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/jun06/060601j.asp |title=Louisiana attorney general launches HSUS investigation |publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association |date=June 1, 2006 |access-date=April 8, 2012}}</ref> Neither Attorney General Charles Foti nor his successor Buddy Caldwell took any action, and the inquiry focusing on HSUS ended in early 2008. AR-HR's analysis of the HSUS's 2005, 2006, and 2007 tax returns claimed that 48% of the $34.6 million donated to the HSUS for the purposes of helping animals after Hurricane Katrina was then unaccounted for.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ar-hr.com/?page_id=718 |title=Money Mysteries Part 1: Hurricane Katrina HSUS Fundraising |access-date=April 20, 2013}}</ref>  For a number of years, HSUS published updates on its Gulf Coast spending, the last of which appeared in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.humanesociety.org/news/news/2011/08/six_years_after_katrina_hsus.html |title=Six Years After Katrina, HSUS Highly Active in Gulf Coast States |work=humanesociety.org |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref>

===Allegations of misleading fundraising materials===
Critics including the CCF, AR-HR, and Nathan Winograd have accused HSUS of misleading donors into thinking that their donations directly '''support''' local animal shelters, when HSUS has no affiliation with or control over local humane societies. HSUS states on its website that it is not affiliated with local animal shelters,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.humanesociety.org/animal_community/resources/qa/common_questions_on_shelters.html#.UqOk5vRDuMR |title=Common Questions about Animal Shelters |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |work=HumaneSociety.org |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> and that the organization's role is to '''supplement and support''' the work of local shelters, not duplicate them. The fundraising materials of HSUS do not make the claim that HSUS runs local shelters, or that donations will be applied directly to local animal shelters.{{cn|date=June 2019}}

===Allegations of financial malfeasance===

According to the "Pennies for Charity" report issued by the [[New York State Attorney General]], of the $1.95 million raised in 2008 by fundraisers, only 5.29% went to HSUS. The average return for charities in the report was 39.5%. HSUS actually incurred a net loss of $5,358 (−0.32%) in 2007. Those figures in 2006 and 2005 numbers were more positive, with 7.27% and 19.99% of contributions going to HSUS.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.charitiesnys.com/pennies_report_new.html |title="Pennies for Charity" – The Attorney General's Report on Fundraisers in New York |access-date=December 9, 2009}}</ref>

In July 2015, the [[Council of State Governments]] (CSG) passed a resolution calling on their states' attorneys general to investigate HSUS' fundraising efforts. The resolution highlighted the fact that HSUS' promotional materials give the impression that animals are the main focus, even though only one percent of the money raised goes to pet shelters (and HSUS runs none itself).<ref>{{cite web |title=Legislative conference seeks HSUS investigation|url= http://brownfieldagnews.com/2015/07/22/legislative-conference-seeks-hsus-investigation/ |work=Brownfield Ag News |access-date=January 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csgmidwest.org/MLC/documents/HSUS-2015.pdf |title=Documents |website=www.csgmidwest.org }}</ref>

===Animal rights agenda===
''[[USA Today]]'', ''[[The International Herald Tribune]]'' and ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'' have described HSUS as devoted to "animal rights", as opposed to "animal welfare".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-03-25-seal-hunt_x.htm |work=USA Today |title=Canadian seal hunt begins amid protests |date=March 25, 2006 |access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/03/27/MN291465.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |title=Dolphins hunt for mines in gulf waters / Trained animals helping Navy clear vital port of Umm Qasr |first=Chuck |last=Squatriglia |date=April 1, 2003}}</ref> Shortly after Wayne Pacelle joined HSUS, he stated in an interview with the ''Animal People'' newspaper that his goal was to build "a National Rifle Association of the animal rights movement".<ref name="activistcash">[http://www.activistcash.com/organization_overview.cfm/oid/136 Humane Society of the United States] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080711023957/http://www.activistcash.com/organization_overview.cfm/oid/136 |date=July 11, 2008}} Activistcash.com</ref>  The IHT describes HSUS as the "least radical" of animal rights groups.<ref>{{cite web |last=Severson |first=Kim |url= http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/12/america/animal.php?page=1 |title=Animal advocates' new weapon: Video sharing |work=International Herald Tribune |access-date=March 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080509094624/http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/12/america/animal.php |archive-date=May 9, 2008}}</ref> ''Feedstuffs,'' an agribusiness newspaper, has leveled the charge that HSUS is pursuing a [[vegetarianism]] and [[veganism]] agenda instead of animal welfare.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.animalagalliance.org/images/ag_insert/060506_Feedstuffs_Welfare.pdf |title=High welfare standards will be demanded |work=Feedstuffs |date=June 5, 2006 |access-date=March 30, 2011 |publisher=Animal Agriculture Alliance}}</ref>  In 2010, one journalist in Oregon also claimed that HSUS "primarily works on animal rights legislation."<ref>{{cite news |first=Lynne |last=Terry |url= http://www.oregonlive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/agencies_will_help_breeders_co.html |title=Agencies will help breeders comply with puppy mill law in Oregon |work=OregonLive.com |date=January 5, 2010 |access-date=March 30, 2011}}</ref>

===Charity Navigator===
In June 2014, [[Charity Navigator]] replaced its rating of HSUS with a "Donor Advisory" citing a $15.75 million settlement of a lawsuit.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3848 |title=Charity Navigator Donor Advisory – The Humane Society of the United States |work=CharityNavigator.org |access-date=July 17, 2014}}</ref> A Charity Navigator representative told ''The Washington Examiner'' that a Donor Advisory indicates "extreme concern."<ref name="Richard Pollack" />
The advisory has since been removed. At no point did it ever have anything to do with financial metrics, governance, transparency, or the impact and effectiveness of work to protect animals. It came solely as a result of a legal settlement the HSUS and several other parties reached with the owner of Ringling Bros. circus.

Charity Navigator rated them at 85.09 for the 2014 fiscal year, and at 75.61 for the 2019 fiscal year.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.history&orgid=3848 |title=Rating for the Humane Society of the United States |work=Charity Navigator |access-date=November 2, 2020}}</ref>

===Charity Watch===
The [[American Institute of Philanthropy]], now called Charity Watch, has been critical of the HSUS. Charity Watch gave the HSUS a "C-" in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 4, 2013 |url= http://www.cattlenetwork.com/cattle-news/HumaneWatch-HSUS-nonprofit-rating-improves-to-a-C--226195661.html |title=HumaneWatch: HSUS nonprofit rating improves to "C-" |work=CattleNetwork.com |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> Charity Watch believes that HSUS spends an insufficient percentage of donations on programs, and an inordinately high percentage on fundraising. Using different estimates of fundraising expenses and efficiency, the [[American Institute of Philanthropy]] AIP's rating system heavily penalizes charities for possessing large assets or maintaining more than three years' operating expenses in reserve.<ref>{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Borochoff |url=http://www.charitywatch.org/criteria.html#assets |title=How American Institute of Philanthropy Rates Charities |work=CharityWatch.org |access-date=March 30, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116173244/http://www.charitywatch.org/criteria.html#assets |archive-date=January 16, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Only Charity Watch among all charity evaluation groups believes that organizations should not write off some of their fundraising costs as program expenses.  Other evaluators agree with the approach taken under [[Generally accepted accounting principles]], which permit such joint allocation of expenses.

The organization maintains a focus on particular financial measurements, strictly interpreting all direct mail, telemarketing and solicitation costs as separate fundraising expenses.

===Feld Entertainment litigation===
[[Feld Entertainment]] sued HSUS and other animal-rights advocates and advocacy groups under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. Feld asserted HSUS wrongdoing in relation to litigation brought by animal rights activists against Feld alleging abuse of animals in the circus. This litigation was dismissed in 2009, with the judge finding that animal-rights groups had paid the key witness, a former Feld employee, at least $190,000, a significant amount of which was in a check signed by Mr. Pacelle. HSUS's merger and combination with The Fund for Animals drew HSUS into the case. In December 2012, the [[ASPCA]] settled the Feld suit and agreed to pay $9.3 million.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/28/us/circus-animal-rights-settlement/ |title="Animal rights group pays settlement in circus elephant case", Tom Watkins, CNN, December 28, 2012 |work=CNN.com |date=December 28, 2012 |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> In May 2014, HSUS and the remaining co-defendants (which included two HSUS employees, the HSUS affiliate Fund for Animals, and parties unaffiliated with HSUS) agreed to pay $15.75 million to settle the litigation.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Barakat |agency=Associated Press |url= https://stltoday.com/business/local/animal-rights-groups-to-pay-ringling-circus-million/article_b7d0ed13-e402-5dab-a069-98624a1dca7b.html |title=Animal-rights groups to pay Ringling circus $16 million |work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |date=May 16, 2014 |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>

===IRS complaint===
In November 2013, a complaint was filed with the [[Internal Revenue Service]] against HSUS by the [[Center for Consumer Freedom]]. According to [[Bloomberg News]], the IRS complaint alleges that HSUS "violated IRS rules by listing as contributions the $17.7 million value of air time for its public service announcements to promote pet adoption. The net effect is to raise the ratio of program expenses to total expenses, which the independent assessor Charity Navigator uses to rank the effectiveness of charities." According to Bloomberg News, a tax attorney claims that the "Humane Society shouldn't count the public service air time as contributions."<ref>{{cite news |title=Latest Salvo in Feud Targets Humane Society's Accounting |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-07/latest-salvo-in-feud-targets-humane-society-s-accounting.html |work=Bloomberg.com |date=November 7, 2013 |access-date=November 21, 2013}}</ref>

===Meat packing investigation===
US Agriculture Secretary [[Ed Schafer]] questioned the way HSUS handled its Westland/Hallmark Meat Packing Company investigation, stating that HSUS "sat on four months of production that went out into the marketplace that's now being recalled".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/02/21/beef.recall.video/index.html |work=CNN |title=Humane Society blasted for late release of video in beef recall - CNN.com |date=February 21, 2008 |access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref>  More recently, the debate over forcing animal welfare organizations to release information about cruelty within a specified period of time has prompted criticism from editorial boards and journalists skeptical of the motivations for such calls.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sentinelsource.com/opinion/editorial/agriculture-reporting-bill-more-harmful-than-helpful/article_48809014-7868-5a97-a22a-a56ef9f8c007.html |title=Agriculture reporting bill more harmful than helpful |work=SentinelSource.com |date=January 15, 2014 |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>

===Michael Vick controversy===
The football player [[Michael Vick]] was sentenced to prison for running a dogfighting ring; he was found to have buried dogs alive, drowned them, beaten them to death, and pulled out their teeth without anesthetic. After he had completed his sentence, Vick offered to volunteer his time to an HSUS campaign against dogfighting.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2009/05/michael-vick-to-work-with-humane-society.html |title=Michael Vick to work with Humane Society on its campaign against dogfighting |access-date=April 20, 2013 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 20, 2009}}</ref>  Pacelle's acceptance of Vick's offer and willingness to appear in public and be photographed alongside Vick caused outrage and led one organization with the words "Humane Society" in its name to stress its non-affiliation with the HSUS.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dailysparkstribune.com/view/full_story/3295433/article-Nevada-Humane-Society-responds-to-Michael-Vick-inquiries |title= Nevada Humane Society responds to Michael Vick inquiries |access-date= April 20, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131211221752/http://www.dailysparkstribune.com/view/full_story/3295433/article-Nevada-Humane-Society-responds-to-Michael-Vick-inquiries |archive-date= December 11, 2013 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref> ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine published a major investigative cover story about [[Michael Vick]]'s dogs, and what happened to them after they were seized.

===Misrepresentations of Canadian seafood boycott participation===
In 2006, CCF conducted an informal poll of restaurants listed as boycotting Canadian seafood in protest of the slaughter of seals.  CCF claims that 62% of the chefs and restaurant managers they spoke to on the phone were unaware that their companies were listed as "boycotters" on the HSUS website. In its report, CCF excluded those restaurants that were boycotting Canadian seafood prior to the HSUS boycott, and restaurants that serve any Canadian seafood (regardless of the type or quantity), and drew the conclusion that 78% of the interviewees were not actively participating in the boycott.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://consumerfreedom.com/downloads/reference/docs/060323_HSUSsurvey.pdf  |title=An Investigation of the Canadian Seafood "Boycott" Promoted By the Humane Society of the United States |work=ConsumerFreedom.com |date=March 2006 |access-date=October 1, 2011}}</ref> CCF quotes Loyola Hearn, Canadian Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, as saying: "Some animal rights groups have been misleading the public for years ... it's no surprise at all that the richest of them would mislead the public with a phony seafood boycott."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.consumerfreedom.com/pressRelease_detail.cfm/r/152-humane-society-of-the-united-states-promotes-phony-canadian-seafood-boycott |title=Humane Society of the United States Promotes Phony Canadian-Seafood Boycott |work=ConsumerFreedom.com |date=March 23, 2006 |access-date=October 1, 2011}}</ref>

=== Project Chimps ===
On May 4, 2020, 22 people who worked or volunteered at [[Project Chimps]], a chimpanzee sanctuary primarily funded by HSUS, sent a letter <ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=letter|url=https://theirturn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Letter_to_PC_Board__signed__by_staff_and_caregivers_Redacted.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> to the sanctuary’s Board of Directors to express their concerns about poor veterinary care, overcrowding, inadequate enrichment, and insufficient access to the outdoors for the resident chimps. When Project Chimps refused to acknowledge the welfare violations,<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Bruce Wagman Response to Letter|url=https://helpthechimps.org//wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bruce-Response.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> two whistleblowers posted their evidence<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Documentation|url=https://helpthechimps.org/documentation/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> of the mistreatment online. On July 9th, [[National Geographic]] covered the whistleblower allegations in an investigative story;<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Sanctuary for retired lab chimps embroiled in dispute over quality of its care|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/07/project-chimps-sanctuary-dispute-chimpanzee-welfare/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> Project Chimps later wrote a letter alleging bias in the story.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Letter to Editor Rachael Bale of National Geographic’s Wildlife Watch from Ali Crumpacker|url=https://projectchimps.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Letter-to-the-Editor-from-Ali-Crumpacker-070920.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> On October 14th, the [[Nonhuman Rights Project]], a national legal organization that advocates for animals, issued a public statement <ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Nonhuman Rights Project Calling for Changes at Project Chimps|url=https://www.nonhumanrights.org/blog/calling-for-changes-at-project-chimps/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> demanding that Project Chimps provide the chimps with daily access to the outdoors. Unlike the previous letter to the board of directors and the National Geographic story, the Nonhuman Rights Project also called out the Humane Society of the United States as the primary funder of Project Chimps. Between July and October, activists in New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco staged protests<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Animal Rights Activists Protest HSUS Board Chair Susan Atherton Over Cruelty at Project Chimps|url=https://theirturn.net/2020/10/29/animal-rights-susan-atherton-hsus-project-chimps/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> at the homes and offices of HSUS board members. Project Chimps has issued a public statement<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Project Chimps Response|url=https://projectchimps.org/about/truth/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> defending their living conditions and animal care.

At the time that whistleblowers came forward with allegations of animal mistreatment at Project Chimps,<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=allegations|url=https://helpthechimps.org/overview/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> five of its eight board members were ether employed by or served on the board of HSUS.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Leadership|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513011035/https://projectchimps.org/about/leadership/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> After animal rights advocates referenced the board makeup as evidence that HSUS has the power to improve the welfare of the chimps, HSUS removed three of its representatives from the board and stated that “the board makeup seemingly caused some confusion around the relationship between the HSUS and the sanctuary, specifically about who makes decisions on the sanctuary’s behalf.”<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Statement|url=https://www.humanesociety.org/resources/statement-project-chimps|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> 

HSUS claims that Project Chimps is an independent organization,<ref name=":0" /> but internal documents published by whistleblowers demonstrate that the organizations are operationally intertwined and that HSUS wields a significant degree of control over Project Chimps. For example, the Humane Society and Project Chimps email domains are interchangeable;<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=evidence|url=https://theirturn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Evidence-emails-interchangeable.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> HSUS’s Information Technology (IT) department serves at the IT department for Project Chimps;<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=integrates|url=https://theirturn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HSUS-intergrates-Project-Chimps-4.jpg|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> and HSUS pays some of Project Chimps bills;<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Consultant|url=https://theirturn.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/HSUS-pay-Project-Chimps-consultant.jpg|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> HSUS pays the salary of the Executive Director of Project Chimps.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Page 8 says Ali Crumpacker made around $97,000 in 2018.

===Other criticisms===

1% of the group's budget goes directly to shelters,<ref name="humanewatch.org">[http://www.humanewatch.org/the_humane_society_of_the_united_states_and_pet_shelter_giving/ "The Humane Society of the United States and Pet Shelter Giving"]; ''HumaneWatch''</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">[http://www.humanewatch.org/hsus-is-not-your-local-humane-society/ HSUS is Not Your Local Humane Society]. HumaneWatch</ref> and in recent years, HSUS has taken criticism for not dispersing enough money, in ratio to what it receives from memberships and donations, to local humane societies and shelters, though the HSUS webpage clearly states they are unaffiliated with local shelters,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.humanesociety.org/animal_community/resources/facts/HSUS_local_shelters.html |title=How Is The HSUS Affiliated with Your Local Humane Society? |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |work=HumaneSociety.org |access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref>
and is the largest [[nonprofit organization]] advocating [[animal rights]] in the world.{{citation needed|reason=The evidence for the organization to be 'animal rights' and the largest such group in the world is not provided, and this statement is more opinion that demonstrated fact |date=October 2014}}{{efn|The organization's policy statements make clear that the HSUS does not oppose all uses of animals, so it does not fit within the strict animal rights category of organizations from either a philosophical or a practical perspective; rather, it is classified that way by some parties because in everyday parlance, those individuals and groups that advocate for more protections for animals are described as supporting animal rights or being animal rights advocates.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.humanesociety.org/about/policy_statements/our_policies_1.html |title=Our Policies |work=humanesociety.org |access-date=October 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka, Zoopolis: A Political Theory of Animal Rights, 19.</ref>}}
Unlike its founding vision which strictly revolved around [[animal welfare]], HSUS has evolved to work towards establishing a broad range of [[animal rights]] legislation, including those involving [[companion animal]]s, [[wildlife]], [[farm animals]], [[horse]]s and other [[Equus (genus)|equines]], and animals used in research, [[Animal testing|testing]] and education.{{citation needed|reason=neither reference made any mention of this shift of vision or focus, quite the contrary, one of them described the original broad purpose of HSUS to help all animals |date=November 2014}}

==Animal Charity Evaluators review==
Animal charity evaluator [[Animal Charity Evaluators]] recommended the Humane Society of the United States' Farm Animal Protection Campaign as a Standout Charity between May 2014 and February 2018.<ref name=ace-review>{{cite web |url= https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/charity-review/humane-society-of-the-united-states-farm-animal-protection-campaign/ |title=HSUS Farm Animal Protection Campaign |work=AnimalCharityEvaluators.org |date=November 2016 |access-date=November 29, 2016}}</ref>  ACE designates as Standout Charities those organizations which they do not feel are as strong as their Top Charities, but which excel in at least one way and are exceptionally strong compared to animal charities in general.<ref name=smith>{{cite web |url= http://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/our-thinking-on-standout-organizations/ |title=Our Thinking on Standout Organizations |first=Allison |last=Smith |date=June 9, 2016 |access-date=November 29, 2016}}</ref>

In their November 2016 review of the HSUS Farm Animal Protection Campaign, ACE cited their strengths as their large reach, strategic approach, and long track record of legal work, corporate outreach, and meat reduction programs.  ACE stated that their primary concern with the Farm Animal Protection Campaign was that it was unclear the extent to which their budget comes from the HSUS general budget, and whether small donations to the Farm Animal Protection Campaign would be fungible with other HSUS activities.<ref name=ace-review />

In February 2018, ACE rescinded their recommendation of the HSUS Farm Animal Protection Campaign following allegations of misconduct from both the former president of HSUS and the former vice president of the Farm Animal Protection Campaign. This rescission was made because ACE believes strong, ethical leadership and a healthy work environment are critical components of an effective charity.<ref name=rescission>{{cite web |url= https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/decision-to-rescind-our-recommendation-of-hsus-fapc/ |title=ACE'S Decision to Rescind Our Recommendation of the HSUS Farm Animal Protection Campaign |first=Allison |last=Smith |date=February 2, 2018 |access-date=March 15, 2018}}</ref>
