The Indian National Congress conducted its first session in [[Bombay]] from 28–31 December 1885 at the initiative of retired [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Civil Service officer]] [[Allan Octavian Hume]]. In 1883, Hume had outlined his idea for a body representing Indian interests in an open letter to graduates of the [[University of Calcutta]].<ref name="indiatoday.in">{{cite web|author=Jigyasu Intoday |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/indian-national-congress-was-formed-on-this-day-facts-about-inc-1117601-2017-12-28 |title=On this day in 1885, Indian National Congress was formed: 12 facts about one of the oldest political parties of the country – Education Today News |publisher=Indiatoday.in |date=28 December 2017 |access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/The-long-march-to-freedom/article14571467.ece |title=The long march to freedom – IN SCHOOL |newspaper=The Hindu |date=16 August 2016 |access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref> Its aim was to obtain a greater share in government for educated Indians, and to create a platform for civic and political dialogue between them and the British Raj.

====Early years====
[[File:Sri Aurobindo presiding over a meeting of the Nationalists after the Surat Congress, with Tilak speaking, 1907.jpg|thumb|left|Congress "extremist" [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] speaking in 1907 as the Party split into moderates and extremists. Seated at the table is [[Aurobindo Ghosh]] and to his right (in the chair) is [[G. S. Khaparde]], both allies of Tilak.]]
[[File:Gopal krishan gokhale.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], a constitutional social reformer and moderate nationalist, was elected president of the Indian National Congress in 1905.]]

At the beginning of the 20th century, Congress' demands became more radical in the face of constant opposition from the British government, and the party decided to advocate in favour of the independence movement because it would allow a new political system in which Congress could be a major party. By 1905, a division opened between the moderates led by Gokhale, who downplayed public agitation, and the new extremists who advocated agitation, and regarded the pursuit of social reform as a distraction from nationalism. [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], who tried to mobilise Hindu Indians by appealing to an explicitly Hindu political identity displayed in the annual public [[Ganapati]] festivals he inaugurated in western India, was prominent among the extremists.<ref>Stanley A. Wolpert, ''Tilak and Gokhale: Revolution and Reform in the Making of Modern India'' (1962) p 67</ref>

Congress included a number of prominent political figures. [[Dadabhai Naoroji]], a member of the sister [[Indian National Association]], was elected president of the party in 1886 and was the first Indian Member of Parliament in the [[British House of Commons]] (1892–1895). Congress also included [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], [[Bipin Chandra Pal]], [[Lala Lajpat Rai]], [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], and [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]]. Jinnah was a member of the moderate group in the Congress, favouring [[Hindu–Muslim unity]] in achieving self-government.{{sfn|Singh|pp=41–42}} Later he became the leader of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and instrumental in the creation of [[Pakistan]]. Congress was transformed into a mass movement by [[Surendranath Banerjee]] during the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition of Bengal in 1905]], and the resultant [[Swadeshi movement]].<ref name="INC"/>

====Congress as a mass movement====

The rise of Gandhi's popularity and his ''satyagraha'' art of revolution led to support from [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], [[Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Rajendra Prasad]], [[Khan Mohammad Abbas Khan]], [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]], [[C.

===Post-independence===
After Indian independence in 1947, the Indian National Congress became the dominant political party in the country. In 1952, in the [[1951 Indian general election|first general election]] held after Independence, the party swept to power in the national parliament and most state legislatures. It held power nationally until 1977, when it was defeated by the Janata coalition. It returned to power in 1980 and ruled until 1989, when it was once again defeated. The party formed the government in 1991 at the head of a coalition, as well as in 2004 and 2009, when it led the United Progressive Alliance. During this period the Congress remained centre-left in its social policies while steadily shifting from a socialist to a [[neoliberal]] economic outlook.<ref>{{cite web|author=1:48&nbsp;pm |url=https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/captains-musings/new-year-aspirations-can-india-hope-for-a-centrist-progressive-liberal-party/ |title=New year aspirations – Can India hope for a centrist progressive liberal party? |publisher=Blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |access-date=16 August 2018}}</ref> The Party's rivals at state level have been national parties including the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (CPIM), and various regional parties, such as the [[Telugu Desam Party]], [[All India Trinamool Congress|Trinamool Congress]] and [[Aam Aadmi Party]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Why India's opposition is nearly irrelevant |url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2017/04/28/why-indias-opposition-is-nearly-irrelevant |website=[[The Economist]] |access-date=6 June 2018 |date=28 April 2017}}</ref>

A post-[[Partition of India|partition]] successor to the party survived as the [[Pakistan National Congress]], a party which represented the rights of religious minorities in the state.

After Shastri's death, Congress elected Indira Gandhi as leader over [[Morarji Desai]]. Once again, politician [[K. Kamaraj]] was instrumental in achieving this result. In 1967, following a poor performance in the general election, Indira Gandhi started moving towards the political left. In mid-1969, she was involved in a dispute with senior party leaders on a number of issues. The two major issues were Gandhi supporting the independent candidate, [[V. V. Giri]], rather than the official Congress party candidate, [[Neelam Sanjiva Reddy]], for the vacant post of the [[President of India]].<ref>Singh, M.P., 1981.

''Asian Survey'', 10(3), pp. 256–262.</ref> The second issue was Mrs. Gandhi's abrupt nationalization of the 14 biggest banks in India, which resulted in the resignation of the finance minister, Morarji Desai. Later in the year, the Congress party president, [[S.

It soon came to be known as the New Congress. In the All India Congress Committee, 446 of its 705 members walked over to Indira's side. This created a belief among Indians that Indira's Congress was the Real Congress (INC-R). After the separation of the two parties, there was also a dispute about the party logo. The "Old Congress" retained the party symbol of a pair of bullocks carrying a yoke while Indira's breakaway faction were given a new symbol of a cow with suckling calf by the Election Commission as the party election symbol. The split occurred when, in 1969, a united opposition under the banner of [[Samyukt Vidhayak Dal]], won control over several states in the [[Hindi Belt]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=npdqD_TXucQC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22indira+gandhi%22+cow++calf+symbol&source=bl&ots=5QKcTsp9OM&sig=cX0FN-NrU1t3iW7Nz5GsDEDjA74&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SybQUvnRG7PUsATChYCwDA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22indira%20gandhi%22%20cow%20%20calf%20symbol&f=false Indira congress]</ref>

The New Congress Party's popular support began to wane in the mid-1970s. From 1975, Gandhi's government grew increasingly more authoritarian and unrest among the opposition grew. On 12 June 1975, the [[Allahabad High Court|High Court of Allahabad]] declared Indira Gandhi's election to the [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house of India's parliament, void on the grounds of electoral malpractice.<ref name=emergency>{{cite web|title=The Emergency, and Indian democracy|url=https://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/southasia/History/Independent/Indira.html|website=sscnet.ucla.edu|publisher=UCLA Division of Social Science|access-date=25 June 2014}}</ref> However, Gandhi rejected calls to resign and announced plans to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]]. She moved to restore order by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition participating in the unrest.

The 1998 general election saw Congress win 141 seats in the Lok Sabha, its lowest tally until then.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2145_98.htm|title=India Parliamentary Chamber: Lok Sabha|website=[[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]|access-date=4 March 2018}}</ref> To boost its popularity and improve its performance in the forthcoming election, Congress leaders urged Sonia Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi's widow, to assume leadership of the party. She had previously declined offers to become actively involved in party affairs, and had stayed away from politics. After her election as party leader, a section of the party that objected to the choice because of her Italian ethnicity broke away and formed the [[Nationalist Congress Party]] (NCP), led by [[Sharad Pawar]]. The breakaway faction commanded strong support in the state of Maharashtra and limited support elsewhere. The remainder continued to be known as the Indian National Congress.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nationalist-Congress-Party|title=Nationalist Congress Party|encyclopedia=[[Britannica]]|access-date=4 March 2018}}</ref>

Sonia Gandhi struggled to revive the party in her early years as its president; she was under continuous scrutiny for her foreign birth and lack of political acumen. In the snap elections called by the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) government in 1999, Congress' tally further plummeted to just 114 seats.<ref name="negi"/> Although the leadership structure was unaltered as the party campaigned strongly in the assembly elections that followed, Gandhi began to make such strategic changes as abandoning the party's 1998 Pachmarhi resolution of ''ekla chalo'', or "go it alone" policy, and formed alliances with other like-minded parties. In the intervening years, the party was successful at various legislative assembly elections; at one point, Congress ruled 15 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-s-19-years-as-congress-president-from-husband-rajiv-s-death-to-son-rahul-s-elevation/story-nmW3hNiG2zDo6abGYc38YO.html|title=Sonia Gandhi's 19 years as Congress president: From husband death to son Rahul's elevation|last=Naqshbandi|first=Aurangzeb|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|access-date=16 December 2017|date=4 March 2018}}</ref> For the 2004 general election, Congress forged alliances with regional parties including the NCP and the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.rediff.com/election/2004/may/14congress.htm|title=The mathematics of politics|website=[[Rediff.com]]|access-date=4 March 2018|date=16 May 2004}}</ref> The party's campaign emphasised social inclusion and the welfare of the common masses{{emdash}}an ideology that Gandhi herself endorsed for Congress during her presidency{{emdash}}with slogans such as ''Congress ka haath, aam aadmi ke saath'' ("Congress hand in hand with the common man"), contrasting with the NDA's "[[India Shining]]" campaign.<ref name="negi">{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/politics/sonia-gandhis-legacy-she-reinvented-herself-to-fight-off-challenges-but-also-had-her-share-of-failures-1606229.html|title=Sonia Gandhi's Legacy: She Reinvented Herself to Fight Off Challenges but also Had Her Share of Failures|last=Negi|first=Saroj|website=[[India Today]]|access-date=2 March 2018|date=16 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/sonia-gandhi-congress-president-rahul-gandhi-politics-4983911/|title=Sonia Gandhi retires as Congress president, to remain active in politics|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=15 December 2017|access-date=15 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/as-sonia-gandhi-makes-way-4984673/ |title=As Sonia Gandhi makes way|last=Chowdhary|first=Neerja|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=16 December 2017|access-date=19 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="Naqshbandi">{{cite news|url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-s-19-years-as-congress-president-from-husband-rajiv-s-death-to-son-rahul-s-elevation/story-nmW3hNiG2zDo6abGYc38YO.html |title=Sonia Gandhi's 19 years as Congress president: From husband Rajiv's death to son Rahul's elevation|last=Naqshbandi|first=Aurangzeb|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|date=16 December 2017|access-date=20 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-election-gandhi/sonia-gandhi-keeps-congress-hopes-alive-in-india-polls-idUSTRE53D1XH20090414 |title=Sonia Gandhi keeps Congress hopes alive in India polls|last=Chandra|first=Rina|work=Reuters|date=14 April 2009|access-date=19 December 2017}}</ref> The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) won 222 seats in the new parliament, defeating the NDA by a substantial margin. With the subsequent support of the communist front, Congress won a majority and formed a new government. Despite massive support from within the party, Gandhi declined the post of prime minister, choosing to appoint Manmohan Singh instead. She remained as party president and headed the [[National Advisory Council]] (NAC).<ref>{{cite news|title=Hands-on influence for Sonia Gandhi as NAC head|url=http://www.livemint.com/Home-Page/bwgztbqFBjfiC4WnGGye3H/Handson-influence-for-Sonia-Gandhi-as-NAC-head.html|access-date=17 August 2016|last=Mathew|first=Liz|work=[[Mint (newspaper)|Livemint]]|date=30 March 2010}}</ref>

During its first term in office, the UPA government passed several social reform bills. These included an [[Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act|employment guarantee]] bill, the [[Right to Information Act]], and a [[Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act|right to education]] act. The NAC, as well as [[Left Front (West Bengal)|the Left Front]] that supported the government from the outside, were widely seen as being the driving force behind such legislation. The Left Front withdrew its support of the government over disagreements about the U.S.–India Civil Nuclear Agreement. Despite the effective loss of 62 seats in parliament, the government survived the trust vote that followed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manmohan survives trust vote|url=http://specials.indiatoday.com/trustvote/|work=India Today|access-date=6 January 2014}}</ref> In the Lok Sabha elections held soon after, Congress won 207 seats, the highest tally of any party since 1991. The UPA as a whole won 262, enabling it to form a government for the second time. The social welfare policies of the first UPA government, and the perceived divisiveness of the BJP, are broadly credited with the victory.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bidwai|first=Praful|title=Reading the Verdict|url=http://www.frontline.in/navigation/?type=static&page=archiveSearch&aid=20090619261209100&ais=12&avol=26|work=Frontline|access-date=6 January 2014}}</ref>

===Economic policy===
The history of economic policy of Congress-led governments can be divided into two periods. The first period lasted from independence, in 1947, to 1991 and put great emphasis on the public sector. The second period began with economic liberalization in 1991.

At the beginning of the first period, the Congress prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru implemented policies based on [[import substitution industrialization]] and advocated a [[mixed economy]] where the government-controlled [[public sector]] would co-exist with the [[private sector]].{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=243}} He believed that the establishment of basic and heavy industry was fundamental to the development and modernisation of the Indian economy. The government, therefore, directed investment primarily into key public-sector industries—steel, iron, coal, and power—promoting their development with subsidies and protectionist policies.{{sfn| Kopstein|2005|p=364}} This period was called the [[Licence Raj]], or Permit Raj,<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1989: from [[Sanskrit|Skr.]] ''rāj'': to reign, rule; cognate with [[Latin|L.]] ''rēx'', ''rēg-is'', [[Old Irish|OIr.]] ''rī'', ''rīg'' king (see RICH).</ref> which was the elaborate system of [[Industrial licensing in India|licences]], regulations, and accompanying [[red tape]] that were required to set up and run businesses in [[India]] between 1947 and 1990.<ref>[http://www.swaminomics.org/articles/20011125_streethawking.htm Street Hawking Promise Jobs in Future] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329023451/http://www.swaminomics.org/articles/20011125_streethawking.htm |date=29 March 2008 }}, ''[[The Times of India]]'', 25 November 2001</ref> The Licence Raj was a result of Nehru and his successors' desire to have a [[planned economy]] where all aspects of the economy were controlled by the state, and licences were given to a select few. Up to 80 government agencies had to be satisfied before private companies could produce something; and, if the licence were granted, the government would regulate production.<ref name="bbcindia1998">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/55427.stm|title=India: the economy|year=1998|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The licence raj system continued under Indira Gandhi.In addition, many key sectors such as banking, steel coal, and oil were nationalized.<ref name="Rosser"/><ref name="Kapila1">{{Cite book

In 1991, the new Congress-party government, led by P. V. Narasimha Rao, initiated reforms to avert the impending [[1991 India economic crisis|1991 economic crisis]].<ref name="Narasimha Rao was father of economic reform: Pranab"/><ref name = "Ghosh">{{cite web|url=http://www.globaleconomicgovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/ghosh-pathways_india.pdf|archive-date=25 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025042847/http://www.globaleconomicgovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/ghosh-pathways_india.pdf|title= India's Pathway through Financial Crisis|work=globaleconomicgovernance.org|others=Arunabha Ghosh|publisher=Global Economic Governance Programme|access-date=2 March 2007}}</ref> The reforms progressed furthest in opening up areas to [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]], reforming [[capital markets]], [[Deregulation|deregulating]] domestic business, and reforming the trade regime. The goals of Rao's government were to reduce the [[fiscal deficit]], [[privatization|privatize]] the public sector, and increase investment in infrastructure. Trade reforms and changes in the regulation of [[foreign direct investment]] were introduced in order to open India to foreign trade while stabilising external loans. Rao chose [[Manmohan Singh]] for the job. Singh, an acclaimed economist and former chairman of the Reserve Bank, played a central role in implementing these reforms.

In 2004, Singh became prime minister of the Congress-led UPA government. Singh remained prime minister after the UPA won the 2009 general elections. The UPA government introduced policies aimed at reforming the banking and financial sectors, as well as public sector companies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Banking on reform|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/banking-on-reform/1059372/|access-date=14 June 2013|newspaper=Indian Express}}</ref> It also introduced policies aimed at relieving farmers of their debt.<ref>{{cite web|title=Farmer Waiver Scheme- PM statement|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=39122|publisher=PIB|access-date=14 June 2013}}</ref> In 2005, Singh's government introduced the [[value added tax]], replacing the [[sales tax]].

At present, Congress endorses a mixed economy in which the private sector and the state both direct the economy, which has characteristics of both [[market economy|market]] and [[Planned economy|planned economies]]. Congress advocates import substitution industrialisation—the replacement of foreign imports with domestic products. Congress believes the Indian economy should be liberalised to increase the pace of development.

===Healthcare and education===

The AICC is composed of delegates sent from the PCCs.<ref name="Kumar1990"/> The delegates elect Congress committees, including the [[Congress Working Committee]], consisting of senior party leaders and office bearers. The AICC takes all important executive and political decisions. Since Indira Gandhi formed Congress&nbsp;(I) in 1978, the [[Congress President|President of the Indian National Congress]] has effectively been the party's national leader, head of the organisation, head of the Working Committee and all chief Congress committees, chief spokesman, and Congress' choice for [[Prime Minister of India]]. Constitutionally, the president is elected by the PCCs and members of the AICC; however, this procedure has often been bypassed by the Working Committee, which has elected its own candidate.<ref name="Kumar1990"/>

The Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) consists of elected MPs in the Lok Sabha and [[Rajya Sabha]]. There is also a Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader in each state. The CLP consists of all Congress [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs) in each state. In cases of states where the Congress is single-handedly ruling the government, the CLP leader is the [[Chief Minister]]. Other directly affiliated groups include: the [[National Students Union of India]] (NSUI), the [[Indian Youth Congress]] – the party's youth wing, the [[Indian National Trade Union Congress]], [[All India Mahila Congress]], its women's division, and Congress [[Seva Dal]]—its voluntary organisation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politicalbaba.com/election-2014/all-india-2014-results-partywise/|title=All India 2014 Results|website=Political Baba|access-date=26 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527000402/http://www.politicalbaba.com/election-2014/all-india-2014-results-partywise/|archive-date=27 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/lok-sabha-election-2014/data|title=Lok Sabha Election 2014 Analysis, Infographics, Election 2014 Map, Election 2014 Charts|website=Firstpost|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924142920/http://www.firstpost.com/lok-sabha-election-2014/data|archive-date=24 September 2015}}</ref>  All India Congress Minority Department also referred as Minority Congress is the minority wing of the Congress party.
