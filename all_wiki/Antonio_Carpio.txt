He obtained his undergraduate degree in Economics from the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] in 1970 and his law degree from the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]] at [[University of the Philippines Diliman|UP Diliman]] where he graduated valedictorian and cum laude in 1975.

Fresh out of law school, Justice Carpio went into private practice and founded the Carpio Villaraza and Cruz law firm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefirmva.com/ourfirm.do|title=V&A Law|website=thefirmva.com}}</ref> He soon emerged as one of the more prominent and successful legal practitioners in the country. Justice Carpio also taught [[tax law]], [[corporate law]], and negotiable instruments law at the UP College of Law from 1983 to 1992.

In 1992, he joined the administration of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel Ramos]] as Chief Presidential Legal Counsel of the Office of the President. As such he worked for major reforms in telecommunications, shipping, civil aviation, and insurance industries. During the presidency of [[Joseph Estrada]], Carpio returned to private practice and penned a regular opinion column published in the [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]].

Carpio was the first appointee of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] to the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] after her assumption into office in January 2001. At the age of 52, he was one of the youngest appointees to the High Court.

== South China Sea dispute ==
Justice Carpio's personal advocacy is "to protect and preserve Philippine territorial and maritime sovereignty specifically in the West Philippine Sea." referring to an area of the South China Sea claimed by the Philippines.<ref>Introduction of Lecturer for the Antiquarian Map Exhibit, Atty. Stephanie V. Gomez-Somera, 21 February 2015 Lopez Museum and Library</ref>

He believes in the importance of "an understanding by citizens of all claimant states...either to restrain extreme nationalism fueled by historical lies or to give hope to a just and durable settlement of the dispute based not only on the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) but also on respect for actual historical facts."

In his speech 'Grand Theft of the Global Commons', Justice Carpio called "...the fishery Regulations of Hainan a grand theft of the global commons in the [[South China Sea]]." He also maintains that "The [[Philippines]] is fighting a legal battle not only for itself but also for all mankind. A victory for the [[Philippines]] is a victory for all States, coastal and landlocked, that China has shut out of the global commons in the [[South China Sea]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18010607/Grand%20Theft%20of%20Global%20Commons%20%28FINAL%20EDITED%20Delivery%20Version%29.pdf|title='Grand Theft of the Global Commons'|publisher=|access-date=2015-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304055728/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18010607/Grand%20Theft%20of%20Global%20Commons%20(FINAL%20EDITED%20Delivery%20Version).pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2015, the Philippine [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] sponsored Justice Carpio on a world lecture tour on the South China Sea dispute. Justice Carpio presented the Philippines' historical and legal case on the dispute before think tanks and universities in 30 cities covering 17 countries.

In May 2017, Justice Carpio published an eBook titled [http://www.imoa.ph/downloads/''"The South China Sea Dispute: Philippine Sovereign Rights and Jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea"'']. It is a collation of his over 140 lectures and speeches "intended to convince the Chinese people that the nine-dashed line has no legal or historical basis." The eBook "explains in layman’s language the South China Sea dispute from A to Z."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://murillovelardemap.com/south-china-sea-dispute-philippine-sovereign-rights-jurisdiction-west-philippine-sea/|title=The South China Sea Dispute: Philippine Sovereign Rights and Jurisdiction in the West Philippine Sea - Murillo Velarde Map|publisher=|format=eBook}}</ref>
