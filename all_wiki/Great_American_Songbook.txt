==Definition==

According to the Great American Songbook Foundation: <blockquote>The “Great American Songbook” is the canon of the most important and influential American popular songs and [[jazz standards]] from the early 20th century that have stood the test of time in their life and legacy. Often referred to as "American Standards", the songs published during the Golden Age of this genre include those popular and enduring tunes from the 1920s to the 1950s that were created for [[Broadway theatre]], [[musical theatre]], and [[Hollywood]] [[musical film]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thesongbook.org/about/what-is-the-songbook/|title=A Great American Songbook Foundation|website=The Center For The Performing Arts}}</ref></blockquote>

Culture writer Martin Chilton defines the term "Great American Songbook" as follows: "Tunes of Broadway musical theatre, Hollywood movie musicals and [[Tin Pan Alley]] (the hub of songwriting that was the music publishers' row on New York’s West 28th Street)". Chilton adds that these songs "became the core repertoire of jazz musicians" during the period that "stretched roughly from 1920 to 1960".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/in-depth-features/cover-to-cover-the-story-of-the-great-american-songbook/|title=Cover To Cover: The Story Of The Great American Songbook &#124; uDiscover|first=Martin|last=Chilton|date=April 3, 2020}}</ref>

Although several collections of music have been published under the "Great American Songbook" title, the term does not refer to any actual book or specific list of songs. The Great American Songbook includes standards by [[George Gershwin]], [[Cole Porter]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Jerome Kern]], [[Harold Arlen]], [[Johnny Mercer]], and [[Richard Rodgers]], among others.<ref name=Complete>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Michael|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Music History |year=2008 |publisher=Penguin |pages=175 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jv-A9t9gGxIC&pg=PA175}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thecenterpresents.org/?utm_source=thecenterfortheperformingarts.org|title=The Center for the Performing Arts|website=The Center For The Performing Arts}}</ref><ref name=NPR2015>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/02/21/387985056/after-an-education-in-american-jazz-a-musician-tackles-the-turkish-songbook|title=After An Education In American Jazz, A Musician Tackles The Turkish Songbook|website=NPR.org}}</ref><ref name="Bside">{{cite web |last1=Feinstein |first1=Michael |title=‘The B Side,’ by Ben Yagoda |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/books/review/the-b-side-by-ben-yagoda.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=13 December 2018 |date=11 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=Friedwald>Friedwald, Will.

In [[Alec Wilder]]'s 1972 study, ''American Popular Song: The Great Innovators, 1900–1950'', the songwriter and critic lists and ranks the artists he believes belong to the Great American Songbook canon. A composer, Wilder emphasized analysis of composers and their creative efforts in this work.<ref name="wilder">{{cite book |first=Alec |last=Wilder |year=1990 |title=American Popular Song: The Great Innovators 1900–1950 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York & Oxford |isbn=0-19-501445-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/americanpopulars00alec }}</ref>

Radio personality and Songbook devotee [[Jonathan Schwartz (radio)|Jonathan Schwartz]] has described this genre as "America's classical music".<ref>{{cite web| title= Girl Singers: From nightclubs and concert halls to recordings, today's best vocalists put a new spin on old favorites |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-107203386.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131105233041/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-107203386.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= November 5, 2013 |author=Deborah Grace Winer |work=[[Town & Country (magazine)|Town & Country]] |access-date =September 9, 2012|date= September 1, 2003 }}{{Subscription required}}</ref>

Other pop singers who established themselves in the 1960s or later followed with albums reviving songs from the Great American Songbook, beginning with [[Harry Nilsson]] in 1973<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-little-touch-of-schmilsson-in-the-night-mw0002010426 |website=[[AllMusic]]  |title=A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night |last=Ruhlmann |first=William}}</ref> and continuing into the 21st century.{{Cref2|A}} [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Rod Stewart]], and [[Bob Dylan]] made several such albums. Of Ronstadt's 1983 album, ''[[What's New (Linda Ronstadt album)|What's New]]'', her first in a trilogy of standards albums recorded with arranger/conductor [[Nelson Riddle]], Stephen Holden of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:

{{quote|''What's New'' isn't the first album by a rock singer to pay tribute to the golden age of pop, but is ... the best and most serious attempt to rehabilitate an idea of pop that [[Beatlemania]] and the mass marketing of rock [[LP album|LPs]] for teen-agers undid in the mid-'60s.
