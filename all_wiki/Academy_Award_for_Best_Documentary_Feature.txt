The '''Academy Award for Documentary Feature''' is an award for [[documentary film]]s. In 1941, the first awards for feature-length documentaries were bestowed as [[Academy Honorary Award|Special Awards]] to ''[[Kukan]]'' and ''[[Target for Tonight]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.documentary.org/magazine/drive-archive-academy-pushes-preserve-docs |title=The Drive to Archive: Academy Pushes to Preserve Docs |last=Fisher |first=Bob |date=2012 |publisher=[[International Documentary Association]] |access-date=January 4, 2018 }}</ref> They have since been bestowed competitively each year, with the exception of 1946.<ref>[http://www.cinemasight.com/awards-history/19th-academy-awards-1946/19th-academy-awards-1946-nominees-and-winners/ 19th Academy Awards (1946): Nominees and Winners-Cinema Sight by Wesley Lovell]</ref> Copies of every winning film (along with copies of most nominees) are held by the [[Academy Film Archive]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Academy Award-Winning Documentaries|url=https://www.oscars.org/film-archive/collections/academy-award-winning-documentaries|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>

== Winners and nominees ==
Following the Academy's practice, [[film]]s are listed below by the award year (that is, the year they were released under the Academy's rules for eligibility). In practice, due to the limited nature of documentary distribution, a film may be released in different years in different venues, sometimes years after production is complete.

== Process controversies ==
Michael Moore's ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', at the time the highest-grossing documentary film in movie history, was ruled ineligible because Moore had opted to have it played on television prior to the 2004 election. Previously, the 1982 winner ''[[Just Another Missing Kid]]'' had already been broadcast in Canada and won that country's ACTRA award for excellence in television at the time of its nomination.

In 1990, a group of 45 filmmakers filed a protest to the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] over a potential conflict of interest involving Block. They noted that Block was a member of the Documentary Steering Committee, which selects films as nominees, but he had a conflict of interest because his company Direct Cinema owned the distribution rights to three of the five films (including eventual winner ''[[Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt]]'')<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?companies=co0042450&sort=release_date,asc&start=51&ref_=adv_nxt With Direct Cinema Limited (Sorted by Release Date Ascending) - IMDb]</ref> selected that year as nominees for an [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]]. They noted that [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Roger & Me]]'' (distributed by [[Warner Brothers]]) was omitted from the nominees, although it had been highly praised by numerous critics and was ranked by many critics as one of the top ten films of the year.<ref name="conflict">Collins, Glenn. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F3061EFB3D5A0C778EDDAB0894D8494D81 "Film Makers Protest to Academy"], ''The New York Times'', 24 February 1990. Accessed March 6, 2011.</ref>

The controversy over ''Hoop Dreams''' exclusion was enough to have the Academy Awards begin the process to change its documentary voting system.<ref>[http://www.current.org/people/peop423h.html "Steve James, Frederick Marx and Peter Gilbert: ''Hoop Dreams'': from short subject to major league"; current.org; July 30, 1995.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607213731/http://www.current.org/people/peop423h.html |date=June 7, 2007 }}</ref> Roger Ebert, who had declared it to be the best 1994 movie of any kind, looked into its failure to receive a nomination: "We learned, through very reliable sources, that the members of the committee had a system. They carried little flashlights. When one gave up on a film, he waved a light on the screen. When a majority of flashlights had voted, the film was switched off. ''Hoop Dreams'' was stopped after 15 minutes."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/the-great-american-documentary|title=The great American documentary ‚Äì Roger Ebert's Journal ‚Äì Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com}}</ref>

The Academy's executive director, Bruce Davis, took the unprecedented step of asking accounting firm [[Price Waterhouse]] to turn over the complete results of that year's voting, in which members of the committee had rated each of the 63 eligible documentaries on a scale of six to ten. "What I found," said Davis, "is that a small group of members gave zeros (actually low scores) to every single film except the five they wanted to see nominated. And they gave tens to those five, which completely skewed the voting. There was one film that received more scores of ten than any other, but it wasn't nominated. It also got zeros (low scores) from those few voters, and that was enough to push it to sixth place."<ref>Pond, Steve, ''The Big Show: High Times and Dirty Dealings Backstage at the Academy Awards'', pg. 74, Faber and Faber, 2005</ref>

In 2000, Arthur Cohn, the producer of the winning ''One Day in September'' boasted "I won this without showing it in a single theater!" Cohn had hit upon the tactic of showing his Oscar entries at invitation-only screenings, and to as few other people as possible. Oscar bylaws at the time required voters to have seen all five nominated documentaries; by limiting his audience, Cohn shrank the voting pool and improved his odds. Following protests by many documentarians, the nominating system subsequently was changed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/one-day-in-september-2001|title=One Day In September Movie Review (2001) ‚Äì Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com}}</ref>

''Hoop Dreams'' director [[Steve James (producer)|Steve James]] said "With so few people looking at any given film, it only takes one to dislike a film and its chances for making the short list are diminished greatly. So they've got to do something, I think, to make the process more sane for deciding the shortlist."<ref name="indiewire.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/article/michael-moore-best-documentary-oscar-will-be-chosen-by-the-full-academy|title=Michael Moore: Best Documentary Oscar Will Be Chosen By the Full Academy ‚Äì IndieWire|first=Indiewire|last=Team|website=www.indiewire.com}}</ref> Among other rule changes taking effect in 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/articles/639099-the-other-oscars-best-documentary-feature#/slide/1|title=The OTHER Oscars: Best Documentary Feature ‚Äì |website=CraveOnline|date=31 January 2014}}</ref> the Academy began requiring a documentary to have been reviewed by either ''The New York Times'' or ''Los Angeles Times'', and be commercially released for at least one week in both of those cities. Advocating for the rule change, Michael Moore said "When people get the award for best documentary and they go on stage and thank the Academy, it's not really the Academy, is it? It's 5% of the Academy."<ref name="indiewire.com" />

The awards process has also been criticized for emphasizing a documentary's subject matter over its style or quality. In 2009, ''Entertainment Weekly'''s Owen Gleiberman wrote about the documentary branch members' penchant for choosing "movies that the selection committee deemed good because they're good for you... a kind of self-defeating aesthetic of granola documentary correctness."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2009/11/20/oscar-documentary-scandal/|title=Oscar documentary scandal: The real reason that too many good movies got left out|date=20 November 2009|website=ew.com}}</ref>

In 2014, following the announcement of the shortlist of eligible feature documentary nominees, [[Sony Pictures Classics]] co-president Tom Bernard publicly criticized Academy documentary voters after they excluded SPC's ''[[Red Army (film)|Red Army]]'' from the shortlist. "It's a sign of some really old people in the documentary area of the Academy. There's a lot of people who are really up in their years. It's shocking to me that that film (''Red Army'') didn't get in," Bernard said.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sony-classics-tom-bernard-slams-754619|title=Sony Classics' Tom Bernard Slams Oscar Voters for Snubbing Russian Hockey Doc 'Red Army'|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}</ref> Additionally, in his reporting of the Oscar documentary shortlist exclusions that year, ''The Hollywood Reporter''‚Ä≤s'' ''Scott Feinberg reacted to ''Red Army'''s omission: "...no matter which 15 titles the doc branch selected, plenty of other great ones would be left on the outside. That is the case, most egregiously, with [[Gabe Polsky]]'s ''Red Army'' (Sony Classics), a masterful look at the role of sports in society and [[Russian-American relations]]".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscar-doc-shortlist-a-brutal-753358|title=Oscar Doc Shortlist: A Brutal Year to Have to Select Just 15 Finalists|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en}}</ref> (''[[Icarus (2017 film)|Icarus]]'', another documentary related to sports and Russian-American relations, later won the Oscar.)

In 2017, following the win of the eight-hour ''O.J.: Made in America'' in this category, the Academy announced that multi-part and limited series would be ineligible for the award in the future, even if they are not broadcast after their Oscar-qualifying release (as was ''O.J.: Made in America'').<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/oscars-new-rules-documentary-oj-made-in-america-barred-1202026406/ |title=Oscars: New Rules Bar Multi-Part Documentaries Like 'O.J.: Made in America' |first=Dave |last=McNary |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2017-04-07 |accessdate=2017-05-30}}</ref>
