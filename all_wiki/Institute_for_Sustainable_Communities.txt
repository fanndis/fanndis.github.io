==ISC's Impact== 
The founding mission of ISC is to help communities around the world address environmental, economic, and social challenges to build a better future shaped and shared by all.   

ISC has led community-driven projects across the globe. The organization's approach to addressing these challenges ensures solutions that emerge from within the communities they are working with, rather than being imposed from the outside. They combine technical expertise and leadership training with strategic investments in local organizations in order to create lasting change.
