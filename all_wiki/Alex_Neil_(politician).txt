==Political career==

===Early years===
After graduating with an [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]] (Hons) degree in 1973,<ref name=":0">{{Citation|title=Neil, Alexander, (born 22 Aug. 1951), Member (SNP) Airdrie and Shotts, Scottish Parliament, since 2011 (Central Scotland, 1999–2011)|date=2007-12-01|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.001.0001/ww-9780199540884-e-29277|work=Who's Who|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u29277|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref> Neil was appointed as the first-ever [[Research assistant|research officer]] for the [[Organisation of Scottish Labour|Scottish Executive Committee of the Labour Party]]. In 1976, Neil, along with [[Jim Sillars]] and [[John Robertson (Scottish Labour Party founder)|John Robertson]], left the Labour Party to form the breakaway group, the [[Scottish Labour Party (1976-1981)|Scottish Labour Party]] (SLP). Neil served as General Secretary of the SLP from 1976 to 1979. By 1979 the SLP had collapsed and Neil fell out of active politics until 1985 when he joined the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP).

===SNP===
Neil would go on to become the SNP's [[Publicity]] Director, and then in charge of the party's policy, as well as a candidate in the 1989 [[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]] [[1989 Glasgow Central by-election|by-election]] and candidate in the [[Kilmarnock and Loudoun (UK Parliament constituency)|Kilmarnock and Loudoun]] constituency in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] and [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general elections]].

===Member of the Scottish Parliament===
In [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999]] he was elected SNP regional list [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]] for [[Central Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Central Scotland]] in the first [[Scottish Parliament]].

The following year he stood unsuccessfully in the hard-fought [[2000 Scottish National Party leadership election|contest for the leadership of the SNP]] against [[John Swinney]]. Thereafter he was appointed chair of the Scottish Parliament's Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee, a role he kept on until 2003.

In [[2003 Scottish Parliament election|2003]] he was re-elected as SNP MSP for Central Scotland to the Scottish Parliament.

In July 2004, Neil announced that he would not be a candidate in the impending contest for the leadership of the SNP, despite the fact that he believed he had considerable support within the party. He said that the reason for his decision was that senior figures in the party (such as MSP [[Fergus Ewing]] and former SNP leader [[Alex Salmond]]) had made it clear publicly that they would not work with him as leader.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12500732.Neil_drops_out_of_SNP_leadership_race_with_attack_on_colleagues_who__apos_undermined_apos__him/ |title=Neil drops out of SNP leadership race with attack on colleagues who 'undermined' him |work=The Herald |date=5 July 2004 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}</ref>

In 2004 Neil was appointed chair of the Enterprise and Culture Committee. He was also a co-convenor of the Scottish Parliament's Cross-Party Group on the Scottish Economy.

Neil emerged as a leading supporter of former policewoman [[Shirley McKie]] as she bid to win compensation from the [[Scottish Government]] following her acquittal from perjury charges.

He was again re-elected as a regional MSP for Central Scotland in [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007]]. He sat on the European and External Relations Committee and the Finance Committee from 2007–2009, upon his promotion to Scottish Minister.

He voted for Brexit in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum on the UK's membership of the EU]], and is the only SNP MSP to publicly admit doing so.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37870167|title=SNP ex-minister Alex Neil voted for Brexit|date=4 November 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

In August 2020 he announced that he would be standing down as an MSP at the upcoming [[2021 Scottish Parliament election|2021 Holyrood election]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cochrane |first1=Angus |title=SNP veteran Alex Neil to stand down as MSP at 2021 Holyrood election |url=https://www.thenational.scot/news/18670081.snp-veteran-alex-neil-stand-msp-2021-holyrood-election/ |website=[[The National (Scotland)|The National]] |accessdate=23 August 2020 |language=en |date=23 August 2020}}</ref>

===Government Minister===
In the first reshuffle of the SNP Government since it took office in 2007, Neil was appointed as the [[Minister for Housing and Communities]] in February 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6665051.stm |title=Cabinet and ministers at-a-glance |work=BBC News |date=8 December 2009}}</ref> In 2011 Neil defeated [[Karen Whitefield]] in the Airdrie and Shotts constituency, gaining a majority of 2001, a 5.5% swing from Labour to SNP.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/election2011/constituency/html/36070.stm |publisher=BBC |title=Vote 2011: Airdrie & Shotts |date=6 May 2011}}</ref> He was promoted to the [[Scottish Cabinet]] on 19 May 2011 by [[Alex Salmond]] to become the new [[Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure and Capital Investment]] after the SNP's landslide win in the 2011 Scottish election.

He was moved from that post to the post of [[Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing]] in September 2012. A month into this post, in an interview with ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' Neil spoke about the possibility of abortion laws being made in Scotland rather than Westminster, saying that politicians would have to consider the medical evidence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/health-secretary-alex-neil-signals-abortion-law-change-after-independence-1-2564884 |title=Health Secretary Alex Neil signals abortion law ‘change after independence’ |first=Tom |last=Peterkin |work=[[Scotland on Sunday]] |date=7 October 2012 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}</ref>

In May 2014 Neil survived a vote of no confidence 57-67. Opposition MSPs had alleged he had acted improperly by cancelling changes to mental health provision when he took up his post as Health Secretary.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13161547.SNP_majority_helps_Neil_fight_off_cross_party_no_confidence_vote/ |title=SNP majority helps Neil fight off cross-party no confidence vote |work=Herald Scotland |date=21 May 2014 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}</ref> After [[Nicola Sturgeon]] became [[First Minister of Scotland]] in November 2014, Neil was appointed to the new post of [[Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice, Communities and Pensioners' Rights]]. He resigned from the Government on 18 May 2016.
