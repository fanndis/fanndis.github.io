'''''The Harvard Independent''''' is a weekly newspaper produced by undergraduate students at [[Harvard University]]. It is one of the leading hard-news media outlets on the Harvard undergraduate campus. It is the oldest weekly newspaper in Cambridge, Massachusetts and at any American university.

==Origin and history==
The ''Independent'' was founded in 1969 by students and alumni who felt the campus needed an alternative to ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]''. The Crimson at the time reflected the left-wing turn of student organizations throughout the nation in the 1960s, and the founders of the Independent felt politically alienated from Crimson editors.

As the decades passed, the weekly newspaper, released every Thursday and distributed both on the Internet and to [[Harvard College]] student dormitories, the format morphed to that of an [[alternative weekly]] rather than a standard newspaper, with illustrated covers and four main sections: News, Sports, Arts, and the Forum (Op-Ed) section. In addition, the Independent also has several themed issues each year, including the annual The Game issue for the Harvard-Yale game, the literary issue, and the Sex Issue, featuring the results of a campus-wide anonymous survey on sexual practices and opinions at Harvard.

The Independent no longer has any political affiliation.
