==Replacement==
On January 2, 2020, Virginia governor [[Ralph Northam]] (D) requested a bill to remove the statue from the U.S. Capitol building. The idea came from Reps. Jennifer Wexton and Donald McEachin. "These statutes aimed to rewrite Lee’s reputation from that of a cruel slave owner and Confederate General to portraying him as a kind man and reluctant war hero who selflessly served his home state of Virginia," Wexton and McEachin wrote in a letter to Northam. A statue of educator and orator [[Booker T. Washington]] or civil rights attorney [[Oliver Hill]] could replace the Lee statue.<ref>[https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/476580-virginia-governor-seeking-to-remove-robert-e-lee-statue-from-us-capitol Virginia governor seeking to remove Robert E.
