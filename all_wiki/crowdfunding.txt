'''Crowdfunding''' is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically via the Internet.<ref>Goran Calic, [http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-the-internet-3v/i1840.xml "Crowdfunding"], ''The SAGE Encyclopedia of the Internet'', 2018</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Definition of Crowdfunding|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/crowdfunding|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en}}</ref> Crowdfunding is a form of [[crowdsourcing]] and [[Alternative Finance|alternative finance]].

== History ==
[[File:Auguste Comte, Souscription 1850.jpg|thumb|A printed receipt 135 x 97 mm issued between 1850 and 1857 to support the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://positivists.org/blog/archives/5959 |title=Crowdsourcing Comte |author=Olaf Simons |publisher=positivists.org |date=2016-03-10 |access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=March 2016}}]]
Crowdfunding has a long history with several roots. Books have been crowdfunded for centuries: authors and publishers would advertise book projects in [[praenumeration]] or [[Subscription (finance)|subscription]] schemes. The book would be written and published if enough subscribers signaled their readiness to buy the book once it was out. The [[subscription business model]] is not exactly crowdfunding, since the actual flow of money only begins with the arrival of the product. The list of subscribers has, though, the power to create the necessary confidence among investors that is needed to risk the publication.<ref name=statue>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21932675|title=The Statue of Liberty and America's crowdfunding pioneer|work=[[BBC Online]]|access-date=April 28, 2013|date=April 24, 2013}}</ref>

[[War bonds]] are theoretically a form of crowdfunding military conflicts. London's mercantile community saved the [[Bank of England]] in the 1730s when customers demanded their pounds to be converted into gold - they supported the currency until confidence in the pound was restored, thus crowdfunded their own money. A clearer case of modern crowdfunding is [[Auguste Comte]]'s scheme to issue notes for the public support of his further work as a philosopher. The "Première Circulaire Annuelle adressée par l'auteur du ''Système de Philosophie Positive''" was published on 14 March 1850, and several of these notes, blank and with sums have survived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://positivists.org/blog/archives/5959 |title=Crowdfunding Comte |author=Olaf Simons |publisher=positivists.org |date=2016-03-11 |access-date=2016-03-11}}</ref> The [[cooperative movement]] of the 19th and 20th centuries is a broader precursor. It generated collective groups, such as community or interest-based groups, pooling subscribed funds to develop new concepts, products, and means of distribution and production, particularly in rural areas of Western Europe and North America. In 1885, when government sources failed to provide funding to build a monumental base for the [[Statue of Liberty]], a newspaper-led campaign attracted small donations from 160,000 donors.<ref name=statue/>

The phenomenon of crowdfunding is older than the term "crowdfunding". According to wordspy.com, the earliest recorded use of the word was in August 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/crowdfunding.asp | title= Crowdfunding's earliest citation }}</ref>

==Types==
The Crowdfunding Centre's May 2014 report identified two primary types of crowdfunding:
# Rewards crowdfunding: entrepreneurs presell a product or service to launch a business concept without incurring debt or sacrificing equity/shares.
# [[Equity crowdfunding]]: the backer receives shares of a company, usually in its early stages, in exchange for the money pledged.<ref name="Cat">{{cite web|title=Crowdfunding Generates More Than $60,000 an Hour (Infographic)|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234051|work=Entrepreneur|publisher=Entrepreneur Media, Inc|access-date=May 25, 2014|author=Catherine Clifford|date=May 19, 2014}}</ref>

===Reward-based===
Reward-based crowdfunding has been used for a wide range of purposes, including motion picture promotion,<ref>{{cite news |title=Crowd funding: An emerging trend in Bollywood |url=http://www.indiatimes.com/bollywood/crowd-funding-an-emerging-trend-in-bollywood-15652.html |access-date=August 12, 2012 |work=The Times Of India}}</ref> [[free software]] development, inventions development, scientific research,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.scienceexchange.com/2012/05/crowdfunding-as-the-future-of-science-funding/ |title=Crowdfunding as the future of science funding? &#124; The Science Exchange Blog |publisher=Blog.scienceexchange.com |date=May 27, 2012 |access-date=August 19, 2012}}</ref> and civic projects.<ref name="Open Citizenship Journal">{{cite journal |title=Crowdfunding and Civic Society in Europe: A Profitable Partnership? |journal=Open Citizenship |url=https://www.academia.edu/3415172 |access-date=April 29, 2013|last1=Hollow |first1=Matthew }}</ref>

Many characteristics of rewards-based crowdfunding, also called non-equity crowdfunding, have been identified by research studies. In rewards-based crowdfunding, funding does not rely on location. The distance between creators and investors on Sellaband was about 3,000 miles when the platform introduced royalty sharing. The funding for these projects is distributed unevenly, with a few projects accounting for the majority of overall funding. Additionally, funding increases as a project nears its goal, encouraging what is called "herding behavior". Research also shows that friends and family account for a large, or even majority, portion of early [[fundraising]]. This capital may encourage subsequent funders to invest in the project. While funding does not depend on location, observation shows that funding is largely tied to the locations of traditional financing options. In reward-based crowdfunding, funders are often too hopeful about project returns and must revise expectations when returns are not met.<ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/>

===Equity===
[[Equity crowdfunding]] is the collective effort of individuals to support efforts initiated by other people or organizations through the provision of finance in the form of equity.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ordanini | first1 = A. | last2 = Miceli | first2 = L. | last3 = Pizzetti | first3 = M. | last4 = Parasuraman | first4 = A. | title = Crowd-funding: Transforming customers into investors through innovative service platforms | doi = 10.1108/09564231111155079 | journal = Journal of Service Management | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 443 | year = 2011 }} (also available as [https://www.scribd.com/doc/59656556/Crowdfunding-Transforming-Customers-into-Investors-through-Innovative-Service-Platforms Scribd document])</ref> In the United States, legislation that is mentioned in the 2012 [[JOBS Act]] will allow for a wider pool of small investors with fewer restrictions following the implementation of the act.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Agrawal|first1=Ajay|last2=Catalini|first2=Christian|last3=Goldfarb|first3=Avi|date=2014-01-01|title=Some Simple Economics of Crowdfunding|journal=Innovation Policy and the Economy|volume=14|issue=1|pages=63–97|doi=10.1086/674021|issn=1531-3468|hdl=1721.1/108043|s2cid=16085029|hdl-access=free}}</ref> Unlike nonequity crowdfunding, equity crowdfunding contains heightened "information asymmetries". The creator must not only produce the product for which they are raising capital, but also create equity through the construction of a company.<ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/> Equity crowdfunding, unlike donation and rewards-based crowdfunding, involves the offer of securities which include the potential for a return on investment. Syndicates, which involve many investors following the strategy of a single lead investor, can be effective in reducing information asymmetry and in avoiding the outcome of market failure associated with equity crowdfunding.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Agrawal|first1=Ajay|last2=Catalini|first2=Christian|last3=Goldfarb|first3=Avi|date=2015-02-25|title=Are Syndicates the Killer App of Equity Crowdfunding?|ssrn=2569988|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2569988|s2cid=37659400}}</ref>

===Software value token===
Another kind of crowdfunding is to raise funds for a project where a digital or software-based value token is offered as a reward to funders which is known as [[Initial coin offering]] (abbreviated to ICO). Value tokens are endogenously created by particular<!-- not all open decentralized networks will have these value tokens; only some. --> open decentralized networks that are used to [[incentivize]] [[Peer-to-peer computing|client computers]] of the network to expend scarce computer resources on maintaining the protocol network. These value tokens may or may not exist at the time of the crowdsale, and may require substantial development effort and eventual software release before the token is live and establishes a market value.  Although funds may be raised simply for the value token itself, funds raised on [[blockchain (database)|blockchain]]-based crowdfunding can also represent [[Equity (finance)|equity]], [[bond (finance)|bonds]], or even "[[market maker|market-maker seats]] of [[governance]]" for the entity being funded.<ref name="tapscott201605">{{cite book|last1=Tapscott|first1=Don|title=The Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business, and the World|last2=Tapscott|first2=Alex|date=May 2016|isbn=978-0670069972|pages=82–83, 128, 181, 245–246|author-link=Don Tapscott}}<!--|accessdate=2016-05-31 --></ref><!-- Tapscott refers to this concept/type of crowdfund as a "blockchain IPO"; not yet sure if that should be mentioned in the article.

===Litigation===
Litigation crowdfunding allows plaintiffs or defendants to reach out to hundreds of their peers simultaneously in a semiprivate and confidential manner to obtain funding, either seeking donations or providing a reward in return for funding. It also allows investors to purchase a stake in a claim they have funded, which may allow them to get back more than their investment if the case succeeds (the reward is based on the compensation received by the litigant at the end of his or her case, known as a [[contingent fee]] in the United States, a success fee in the United Kingdom, or a ''pactum de quota litis'' in many civil law systems).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.invest4justice.com/how-to-succeed-in-crowdfunding-your-legal-claim/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121144155/https://www.invest4justice.com/how-to-succeed-in-crowdfunding-your-legal-claim/ |archive-date=November 21, 2015 }}</ref> [[LexShares]] is a platform that allows accredited investors to invest in lawsuits.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/litigation-funding-moves-into-mainstream-1470338402|title=Litigation Funding Moves Into Mainstream|last=Randazzo|first=Sara|date=2016-08-04|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2017-02-02}}</ref>

== Role ==
The inputs of the individuals in the crowd trigger the crowdfunding process and influence the ultimate value of the offerings or outcomes of the process. Each individual acts as an agent of the offering, selecting and promoting the projects in which they believe. They sometimes play a donor role oriented towards providing help on social projects. In some cases, they become shareholders and contribute to the development and growth of the offering. Individuals disseminate information about projects they support in their online communities, generating further support (promoters).

The motivation for consumer participation stems from the feeling of being at least partly responsible for the success of others people's initiatives (desire for patronage), striving to be a part of a communal social initiative (desire for social participation), and seeking a payoff from monetary contributions (desire for investment).<ref name="unibocconi"/> Additionally, individuals participate in crowdfunding to see new and innovative products before the public. Early access often allows funders to participate more directly in the development of the product. Crowdfunding is also particularly attractive to funders who are family and friends of a creator. It helps to mediate the terms of their financial agreement and manage each group's expectations for the project.<ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/>

An individual who takes part in crowdfunding initiatives tends to have several distinct traits: innovative orientation, which stimulates the desire to try new modes of interacting with firms and other consumers; social identification with the content, cause, or project selected for funding, which sparks the desire to be a part of the initiative; (monetary) exploitation, which motivates the individual to participate by expecting a payoff.<ref name="unibocconi"/> Crowdfunding platforms are motivated to generate income by drawing worthwhile projects and generous funders. These sites also seek widespread public attention for their projects and platform.<ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/>

Crowdfunding websites helped companies and individuals worldwide raise US$89 million from members of the public in 2010, $1.47 billion in 2011, and $2.66 billion in 2012 — $1.6 billion of the 2012 amount was raised in North America.<ref name="huffingtonpost.com_2013-09-07">[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/08/global-crowdfunding-rises-81-percent_n_3036368.html Global Crowdfunding Volumes Rise 81% In 2012], August 4, 2013, ''The Huffington Post'', Retrieved at September 7, 2013</ref>

Crowdfunding is expected to reach US$1 trillion in 2025.<ref name="f2015-10-29">[http://www.myprivatebanking.com/article/report-crowdfunding-and-wealth-management-2015/ The Rise of Crowdfunding] October 28, 2015, MyPrivateBanking Research</ref> A May 2014 report, released by the United Kingdom-based The Crowdfunding Centre and titled "The State of the Crowdfunding Nation", presented data showing that during March 2014, more than US$60,000 were raised on an hourly basis via global crowdfunding initiatives. Also during this period, 442 crowdfunding campaigns were launched globally on a daily basis.<ref name="Cat" />

{{Further|Comparison of crowdfunding services}}
In 2015, it was predicted that there would be over 2,000 crowdfunding sites to choose from in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=2,000 Global Crowdfunding Sites to Choose from by 2016|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-drake/2000-global-crowdfunding-_b_8365266.html|work=The Huffington Post|date=2015-10-23}}</ref>

Fundamental differences exist in the services provided by many crowdfunding platforms.<ref name="unibocconi"/> 

Curated crowdfunding platforms serve as "network orchestrators" by curating the offerings that are allowed on the platform. They create the necessary organizational systems and conditions for resource integration among other players to take place.<ref name="unibocconi"/> Relational mediators act as an intermediary between supply and demand. They replace traditional intermediaries (such as traditional record companies, venture capitalists). These platforms link new artists, designers, project initiators with committed supporters who believe in the persons behind the projects strongly enough to provide monetary support.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Growth engines focus on the strong inclusion of investors. They "disintermediate" by eliminating the activity of a service provider previously involved in the network. The platforms that use crowdfunding to seek stakes from a community of high net-worth private investors and match them directly with project initiators.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Significant campaigns==

===Crowdfunding for Statue of Liberty===
In the summer of 1885, crowdfunding diverted a crisis that threatened the completion of the Statue of Liberty. Construction of the statue’s [[pedestal]] stalled due to a lack of financing. Fundraising efforts for the project fell short of the necessary amount by more than a third. New York Governor [[Grover Cleveland]] refused to appropriate city funds toward the project, and Congress could not agree on a funding package.

Recognizing the social and symbolic significance of the statue, publisher [[Joseph Pulitzer]] came to the rescue by launching a five-month fundraising campaign in his newspaper ''[[New York World|The World]]''. The paper solicited contributions by publishing articles that appealed to the emotions of New Yorkers. Donations of all sizes poured in, ranging anywhere from $0.15 to $250. More than 160,000 people across America gave including businessmen, waiters, children, and politicians. The paper chronicled each donation, published letters from contributors on the front page, and kept a running tally of funds raised.

The campaign raised over $100,000 (roughly $2 million today) allowing the city to complete construction of the pedestal. Pulitzer and ''The World'' simultaneously saved the Statue of Liberty and gave birth to crowdfunding in American politics.

=== Early campaigns ===

===Real estate ===
Real estate crowdfunding is the online pooling of capital from investors to fund mortgages secured by real estate, such as "[[Flipping|fix and flip]]" redevelopment of distressed or abandoned properties, equity for commercial and residential projects, acquisition of pools of distressed mortgages, home buyer downpayments, and similar real estate related outlets. Investment, via specialized online platforms in the US, is generally completed under Title II of the [[JOBS Act]] and is limited to accredited investors.

===Intellectual property exposure===
One of the challenges of posting new ideas on crowdfunding sites is there may be little or no [[intellectual property]] (IP) protection provided by the sites themselves. Once an idea is posted, it can be copied. As Slava Rubin, founder of IndieGoGo, said: "We get asked that all the time, 'How do you protect me from someone stealing my idea?' We're not liable for any of that stuff."<ref>[http://www.inventorsdigest.com/archives/7037 Mike Drummond, "Making it Rain: Seeking Seed Money from the Crowd"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630225312/http://www.inventorsdigest.com/archives/7037 |date=June 30, 2013 }}, [[Inventors Digest]], August 2011</ref> Inventor advocates, such as Simon Brown, founder of the UK-based United Innovation Association, counsel that ideas can be protected on crowdfunding sites through early filing of [[patent applications]], use of [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] protection as well as a new form of idea protection supported by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] called [[Creative Barcode]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Simon Brown |url=http://www.ipworld.com/ipwo/doc/view.htm?id=270623&sectionID=features&searchCode=SEC |title=Simon Brown, "Follow the Crowd", Intellectual Property Magazine, July 2011 |publisher=Ipworld.com |access-date=August 19, 2012}}</ref>

=== Science ===
A number of platforms have also emerged that specialize in the crowdfunding of scientific projects, such as [[experiment.com]], and The Open Source Science Project.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gorbis|first1=Marina|title=The Nature of the Future: Dispatches from the Socialstructed World|date=2013|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-1-4516-4118-9|pages=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8HOOMDPuCQC}}</ref> In the scientific community, these new options for research funding are seen ambivalently. Advocates of crowdfunding for science emphasize that it allows early-career scientists to apply for their own projects early on, that it forces scientists to communicate clearly and comprehensively to a broader public, that it may alleviate problems of the established funding systems which are seen to fund conventional, mainstream projects, and that it gives the public a say in science funding.<ref>{{cite web|author=Neel V. Patel |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/04/crowdfunded-science-legit-science/ |title=Neel V. Patel, "Crowdfunded Science is here", Wired Magazine, April 24, 2015 |access-date=October 4, 2016}}</ref> In turn, critics are worried about quality control on crowdfunding platforms. If non-scientists were allowed to make funding decisions, it would be more likely that "panda bear science" is funded, i.e. research with broad appeal but lacking scientific substance.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nayanah Siva |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61661-5/abstract |title=Nayanah Siva, "Crowdfunding medical research picks up the pace", The Lancet, September 20, 2014 |access-date=October 4, 2016}}</ref>

Initial studies found that crowdfunding is used within science, mostly by young researchers to fund small parts of their projects, and with high success rates. At the same time, funding success seems to be strongly influenced by non-scientific factors like humor, visualizations, or the ease and security of payment.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mike S. Schaefer|display-authors=et al |title= Selling Science 2.0 |journal=Public Understanding of Science |year=2016 |doi=10.1177/0963662516668771 |pmid=27647666 |volume=27 |issue=5|pages=496–514 |pmc=6041758 }}</ref>

=== Journalism ===
In order to fund online and print publications, journalists are enlisting the help of crowdfunding. Crowdfunding allows for small start-ups and individual journalists to fund their work without the institutional help of major public broadcasters. Stories are publicly pitched using crowdfunding platforms such as [[Kickstarter]], [[Indiegogo]], or [[Spot.us]]. The funds collected from crowdsourcing may be put toward travel expenses or purchasing equipment. Crowdfunding in journalism may also be viewed as a way to allow audiences to participate in news production and in creating a [[participatory culture]].<ref name="Hunter">{{cite journal|date=February 2015|title=Crowdfunding independent and freelance journalism: Negotiating journalistic norms of autonomy and objectivity|journal=New Media & Society|volume=17|issue=2|pages=272–288|doi=10.1177/1461444814558915|last1=Hunter|first1=Andrea|s2cid=21039809}}</ref> Though deciding which stories are published is a role that traditionally belongs to editors at more established publications, crowdfunding can give the public an opportunity to provide input in deciding which stories are reported. This is done by funding certain reporters and their pitches. Donating can be seen as an act that "bonds" reporters and their readers. This is because readers are expressing interest for their work, which can be "personally motivating" or "gratifying" for reporters.<ref name="Aitamuro">{{cite journal|date=August 2011|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=5|issue=4|pages=429–445|doi=10.1080/17512786.2010.551018|last1=Aitamurto|first1=Tanja|title=The Impact of Crowdfunding on Journalism|s2cid=54194660}}</ref>

[[Spot.us]], which was closed in February 2015, was a crowdfunding platform that was specifically meant for journalism.<ref name="Hunter" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicinsightnetwork.org/2015/02/11/spot-us-is-going-away-but-its-legacy-inspires-new-chapters-of-crowdfunding-playbook/|title=Spot.us is going away, but its legacy inspires new chapters of crowdfunding playbook|website=Public Insight Network|access-date=2017-04-20}}</ref> The website allowed for readers, individual donors, registered [[Spot.us]] reporters, or news organizations to fund or donate talent toward a pitch of their choosing. While funders are not normally involved in editorial control, [[Spot.us]] allowed for donors or "community members" to become involved with the co-creation of a story. This gave them the ability to edit articles, submit photographs, or share leads and information.<ref name="Aitamuro" /> According to an analysis by [[Public Insight Network]], [[Spot.us]] was not sustainable for various reasons. Many contributors were not returning donors and often, projects were funded by family and friends. The overall market for crowdfunding journalism may also be a factor; donations for journalism projects accounted for .13 percent of the $2.8 billion that was raised in 2013.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicinsightnetwork.org/2015/02/11/spot-us-is-going-away-but-its-legacy-inspires-new-chapters-of-crowdfunding-playbook/|title=Spot.us is going away, but its legacy inspires new chapters of crowdfunding playbook}}</ref>

Larger crowdfunding platforms such as [[Indiegogo]] or [[Kickstarter]], both of which are not journalism-specific, may garner more success for projects. This is because these large-scale platforms can allow journalists to reach new audiences. In 2017, 2.3 million out of [[Kickstarter]]'s 7.9 million users had donated toward more than one project.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Traditionally, journalists are not involved in advertising and marketing. Crowdfunding means that journalists are attracting funders while trying to remain independent, which may pose a conflict. Therefore, being directly involved with financial aspects can call [[journalistic integrity]] and [[journalistic objectivity]] into question. This is also due to the fact that journalists may feel some pressure or "a sense of responsibility" toward funders who support a particular project.<ref name="Hunter" /> Crowdfunding can also allow for a blurred line between professional and non-professional journalism because if enough interest is generated, anyone may have their work published.<ref name="Jian">{{cite journal|last1=Jian|first1=Lian|last2=Usher|first2=Nikki|title=Crowd-Funded Journalism|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|date=January 2014|volume=19|issue=2|pages=155–170|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12051|doi-access=free}}</ref> Crowdfunding enables freelancer journalists to travel to the sites to find the new sources.<ref name="Hunter" />

=== International development ===
There is some hope that crowdfunding has potential as a tool open for use by groups of people traditionally more marginalized.  The World Bank published a report titled "Crowdfunding's Potential for the Developing World" which states that "While crowdfunding is still largely a developed world phenomenon, with the support of governments and development organizations it could become a useful tool in the developing world as well. Substantial reservoirs of entrepreneurial talent, activity, and capital lay dormant in many emerging economies...Crowdfunding and crowdfund investing have several important roles to play in the developing world's entrepreneurial and venture finance ecosystem."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=World|date=2013|title=Crowdfunding's Potential for the Developing World|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/17626|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Legal developments ===
As the popularity of crowdfunding expanded, the SEC, state governments, and Congress responded by enacting and refining many capital-raising exemptions to allow easier access to alternative funding sources. Initially, the Securities Act of 1933 banned companies from soliciting capital from the general public for private offerings. However, "President Obama signed the Jumpstart Our Small Businesses Act ("JOBS Act") into law on April 5, 2012, which removed the ban on general solicitation activities for issuers qualifying under a new exemption called 'Rule 506(c).'" A company can now broadly solicit and generally advertise an offering and still be compliant with the exemption's requirements if:
* The investors in the offering are all accredited investors; and
* The company takes reasonable steps to verify that the investors are accredited investors, which could include reviewing documentation, such as W-2s, tax returns, bank and brokerage statements, credit reports and the like.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answers-rule506htm.html|title=SEC.gov {{!}} Rule 506 of Regulation D|website=www.sec.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref>
Another change was the amendment of SEC Rule 147. Section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act allows for unlimited capital raising from investors in a single state through an intrastate exemption. However, the SEC created Rule 147 with a number of requirements to ensure compliance. For example, the intrastate solicitation was allowed, but a single out-of-state offer could destroy the exemption. Additionally, the issuer was required to be incorporated and do business in the same state of the intrastate offering. With the expansion of interstate business activities because of the internet, it became difficult for businesses to comply with the exemption. Therefore, on October 26, 2016 the SEC adopted Rule 147(a) which removed many of the restrictions to modernize the Rules. For example, companies would have to do business and have its principal place of business in the state where the offering is sold, and not necessarily where ''offered'' per the prior rule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/secg/intrastate-offering-exemptions-compliance-guide-041917.htm|title= Intrastate Offering Exemptions:A Small Entity Compliance Guide for Issuers [1]|website=www.sec.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-01}}</ref>

==Benefits and risks==

===Benefits for the creator===
Crowdfunding campaigns provide producers with a number of benefits, beyond the strict financial gains.<ref>{{cite web|title=Crowdfunding in a Canadian Context|url=http://nordicity.com/reports/CMF-Crowdfunding-Study.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118231657/http://nordicity.com/reports/CMF-Crowdfunding-Study.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 18, 2012|work=Canada Media Fund|access-date=February 12, 2013}}</ref> The following are non financial benefits of crowdfunding.
* Profile – a compelling project can raise a producer's profile and provide a boost to their reputation.
* Marketing – project initiators can show there are an audience and market for their project. In the case of an unsuccessful campaign, it provides good market feedback.
* Audience engagement – crowdfunding creates a forum where project initiators can engage with their audiences. An audience can engage in the production process by the following progress through updates from the creators and sharing feedback via comment features on the project's crowdfunding page.
* Feedback – offering pre-release access to content or the opportunity to beta-test content to project backers as a part of the funding incentives provides the project initiators with instant access to good market testing feedback.

There are also financial benefits to the creator. For one, crowdfunding allows creators to attain low-cost capital. Traditionally, a creator would need to look at "personal savings, home equity loans, personal credit cards, friends and family members, angel investors, and [[venture capitalists]]." With crowdfunding, creators can find funders from around the world, sell both their product and equity, and benefit from increased information flow. Additionally, crowdfunding that supports pre-buying allows creators to obtain early feedback on the product.<ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/> Another potential positive effect is the propensity of groups to "produce an accurate aggregate prediction" about market outcomes as identified by the author [[James Surowiecki]] in his book ''[[The Wisdom of Crowds]]'', thereby placing financial backing behind ventures likely to succeed.

Proponents also identify a potential outcome of crowdfunding as an exponential increase in available venture capital. One report claims that if every American family gave one percent of their investable assets to crowdfunding, $300 billion (a 10X increase) would come into venture capital.<ref name= Gigaom >{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/2012/05/08/fred-wilson-what-crowdfunding-means-for-the-vc-business/ |title= Gigaom: What crowdfunding means for the VC business| access-date=October 15, 2012}}</ref> Proponents also cite that a benefit for companies receiving crowdfunding support is that they retain control of their operations, as voting rights are not conveyed along with ownership when crowdfunding. As part of his response to the Amanda Palmer Kickstarter controversy, Albini expressed his supportive views of crowdfunding for musicians, explaining: "I've said many times that I think they're part of the new way bands and their audience interact and they can be a fantastic resource, enabling bands to do things essentially in cooperation with their audience." Albini described the concept of crowdfunding as "pretty amazing."<ref name="Steve">{{cite web|url=http://www.electricalaudio.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=60267&p=1545867#p1545867|title=Re: amanda "$1.2m" palmer wants you to play with her for free|author=Steve Albini|date=September 13, 2012|work=Electrical Audio|publisher=Electrical Audio|format=Forum post|access-date=May 19, 2014}}</ref>

===Risks and barriers for the creator===
Crowdfunding also comes with a number of potential risks or barriers.<ref name="CMF">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/crowdfunding|title=Oxford Dictionary Definition of Crowdfunding|access-date=July 23, 2014}}</ref> For the creator, as well as the investor, studies show that crowdfunding contains "high levels of risk, uncertainty, and information asymmetry."<ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/>
* Reputation – failure to meet campaign goals or to generate interest results in a public failure. Reaching financial goals and successfully gathering substantial public support but being unable to deliver on a project for some reason can severely negatively impact one's reputation.
* Intellectual property (IP) protection – many Interactive Digital Media developers and content producers are reluctant to publicly announce the details of a project before production due to concerns about idea theft and protecting their IP from plagiarism.<ref name=CMF /> Creators who engage in crowdfunding are required to release their product to the public in early stages of funding and development, exposing themselves to the risk of copy by competitors.<ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/>
* Donor exhaustion – there is a risk that if the same network of supporters is reached out to multiple times, that network will eventually cease to supply necessary support.
* Public fear of abuse – concern among supporters that without a regulatory framework, the likelihood of a scam or an abuse of funds is high. The concern may become a barrier to public engagement.
* Lack of participation - It is seen that some stories are more likely to get picked up than others based on the story. It is easy to get support if you "just tell a story."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2018-02-25/australians-crowdfunding-cancer-care-symptom-not-solution/9475070|title=The hidden costs of crowdfunding medical care|first=Ariel|last=Bogle|date=February 25, 2018}}</ref>

For crowdfunding of equity stock purchases, there is some research in social psychology that indicates that, like in all investments, people don't always do their due diligence to determine if it is a sound investment before investing, which leads to making investment decisions based on emotion rather than financial logic.<ref>{{cite web|last=Isenberg |first=Daniel |url=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/04/the_road_to_crowdfunding_hell.html |title=The Road to Crowdfunding Hell – Daniel Isenberg – Harvard Business Review |publisher=Blogs.hbr.org |date=April 23, 2012 |access-date=August 19, 2012}}</ref> By using crowdfunding, creators also forgo potential support and value that a single angel investor or venture capitalist might offer. Likewise, crowdfunding requires that creators manage their investors. This can be time-consuming and financially burdensome as the number of investors in the crowd rises.<ref name="Agrawal, Ajay 2014"/> Crowdfunding draws a crowd: investors and other interested observers who follow the progress, or lack of progress, of a project. Sometimes it proves easier to raise the money for a project than to make the project a success. Managing communications with many possibly disappointed investors and supporters can be a substantial, and potentially diverting, task.<ref name=NYT91712>{{cite news|title=Success of Crowdfunding Puts Pressure on Entrepreneurs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/technology/success-of-crowdfunding-puts-pressure-on-entrepreneurs.html|access-date=September 18, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 17, 2012|author=Jenna Wortham}}</ref>

Some of the most popular fundraising drives are for commercial companies that use the process to reach customers and at the same time market their products and services. This favors companies like microbreweries and specialist restaurants – in effect creating a "club" of people who are customers as well as investors. In the US in 2015, new rules from the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] to regulate equity crowdfunding will mean that larger businesses with more than 500 investors and more than $25 million in assets will have to file reports like a public company. The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' commented: "It is all the pain of an IPO without the benefits of the IPO."<ref>{{cite news|first=Christopher |last=Mims |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-startup-crowdfunding-isnt-all-its-cracked-up-to-be-1449464460|title=Tech Startup Crowdfunding Isn't All It's Cracked Up to Be |work= [[Wall Street Journal]]date= 7 December 2015}}</ref> These two trends may mean crowdfunding is most suited to small consumer-facing companies rather than tech start-ups.

=== Benefits for the investor ===
There are several ways in which a well-regulated crowdfunding platform may provide the possibility of attractive returns for investors:
* Crowdfunding reduces costs – The platforms reduce search costs and transaction costs, which allows higher participation in the market. Many individual investors would otherwise have a hard time investing in early-stage companies because of the difficulty of identifying a company directly and the high costs of joining an Angel Group or doing it through a professional venture capital firm.
* Current early-stage investing is not efficient – Venture capital firms often neglect the consumer sector and focus mainly on high-tech companies. Crowdfunding opens up some of these neglected markets to individual investors. Crowdfunding doesn't make sense in every industry, but for some, like retail and consumer, it does.
* Value of new investors – Investors can add value to companies when they act as brand advocates and they can even be used as a [[focus group]]. Crowdfunding allows individual investors to be a part of the company they invest in.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/470631-3-reasons-crowdfunding-is-good-for-investors|title=3 Reasons Crowdfunding Is Good For Investors|last=Caldbeck|first=Ryan|date=2012-04-01|newspaper=Seeking Alpha|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>

=== Risks for the investor ===
On crowdfunding platforms, the problem of [[information asymmetry]] is exacerbated due to the reduced ability of the investor to conduct due diligence.<ref name=":1" /> Early-stage investing is typically localized, as the costs of conducting due diligence before making investment decisions and the costs of monitoring after investing both rise with distance. However, this trend is not observed on crowdfunding platforms - these platforms are not geographically constrained and bring in investors from near and far.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Agrawal|first1=Ajay|last2=Catalini|first2=Christian|last3=Goldfarb|first3=Avi|date=2015-06-01|title=Crowdfunding: Geography, Social Networks, and the Timing of Investment Decisions|journal=Journal of Economics & Management Strategy|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=253–274|doi=10.1111/jems.12093|s2cid=154926205|issn=1530-9134|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/99464/1/Catalini-Christian.pdf}}</ref> On non-equity or reward-based platforms, investors try to mitigate this risk by using the amount of capital raised as a signal of performance or quality. On equity-based platforms, [[Syndicate#Crowdfunding|crowdfunding syndicates]] reduce information asymmetry through dual channels – through portfolio diversification and better due diligence as in the case of offline early-stage investing, but also by allowing ''lead investors'' with more information and better networks to lead ''crowds'' of backers to make investment decisions.<ref name=":1" /><ref>Kang L, Jiang Q, Tan C-H. Remarkable Advocates: An Investigation of Geographic Distance and Social Capital for Crowdfunding. Information & Management. 2017;54(3):336-348. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.im.2016.09.001</ref>

===Issues in medical crowdfunding===

The rise of crowdfunding for medical expenses is considered, in large part, a symptom of an inadequate and failing healthcare system in countries such as the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sisler |first1=J. |title=Crowdfunding for medical expenses |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |date=9 January 2012 |volume=184 |issue=2 |pages=E123–E124 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.109-4084|pmid=22231688 |pmc=3273528 }}</ref><ref name=ber-pawi>{{cite journal |last1=Berliner |first1=Lauren S. |last2=Kenworthy |first2=Nora J. |title=Producing a worthy illness: Personal crowdfunding amidst financial crisis |journal=Social Science & Medicine |date=August 2017 |volume=187 |pages=233–242 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.02.008|pmid=28274601 }}</ref> Healthcare through crowdfunding relies on perceived deservingness and worth, which reproduces unequal outcomes in access.<ref name=ber-pawi/>

Rob Solomon, the CEO of [[GoFundMe]], has commented on this: "The system is terrible. It needs to be rethought and retooled. Politicians are failing us. Health care companies are failing us. Those are realities. I don't want to mince words here. We are facing a huge potential tragedy. We provide relief for a lot of people. But there are people who are not getting relief from us or from the institutions that are supposed to be there. We shouldn’t be the solution to a complex set of systemic problems."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Jeffrey |title=Life And Debt: Stories From Inside America's GoFundMe Health Care System |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gofundme-health-care-system_n_5ced9785e4b0ae6710584b27 |website=HuffPost |orig-year=10 June 2019|date=19 June 2019}}</ref>

There are ethical issues in medical crowdfunding. There is a loss of patient privacy, as crowdfunding campaigns that disclose extensive personal information are generally more financially successful.<ref name=dr18/> The oversight regarding the veracity of claims is generally limited.<ref name=dr18>{{cite journal |last1=Dressler |first1=Gabrielle |last2=Kelly |first2=Sarah A |title=Ethical implications of medical crowdfunding: the case of Charlie Gard |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |date=July 2018 |volume=44 |issue=7 |pages=453–457 |doi=10.1136/medethics-2017-104717|pmid=29728452 |s2cid=19118282 }}</ref><ref name=yo17/> For instance, physicians are obliged to uphold the ethics of the medical profession, such as patient confidentiality, but this runs in conflict with dishonest crowdfunding efforts.<ref name=yo17>{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Michael J. |last2=Scheinberg |first2=Ethan |title=The Rise of Crowdfunding for Medical Care |journal=JAMA |date=25 April 2017 |volume=317 |issue=16 |pages=1623–1624 |doi=10.1001/jama.2017.3078|pmid=28334321 }}</ref> Medical  crowdfunding perpetuates inequalities—associated with variables such as gender, class, and race—in access to healthcare.<ref name=ber-pawi/><ref name=dr18/> For example, the most successful campaigns raise funds for patients who are well connected in large social networks and are able to navigate the technological landscape.<ref name=dr18/> Finally, the use of medical crowdfunding might reduce the impetus to reform failing infrastructures to healthcare.<ref name=dr18/>
