==History==
{{Main|History of Nokia}} <!-- Please place a relevant epitome of history here, the previous history section included too many products that aren't a part of Nokia anymore in too much detail, this page should only contain a simple summation of its history -->

===1865–1967=== <!-- Here will be a small epitome of its history prior to 2014 and the original creation of the company -->
[[File:Nokia Toilet paper.JPG|thumb|Rolls of toilet paper produced by Nokia in the 1960s, [[Vapriikki Museum Centre]], Tampere]]

Nokia's history dates to 1865, when [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finnish-Swede]] [[Mining engineering|mining engineer]] [[Fredrik Idestam]] established a [[pulp mill]] near the town of [[Tampere]], Finland (then in the [[Russian Empire]]). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of [[Nokia, Finland|Nokia]], offering better [[hydropower]] resources. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend [[Leo Mechelin]], formed a shared company from it and called it ''Nokia [[Aktiebolag|Ab]]'' (in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''Nokia Company'' being the English equivalent), after the site of the second pulp mill.

Idestam retired in 1896, making Mechelin the company's chairman. Mechelin expanded into [[electricity generation]] by 1902 which Idestam had opposed. In 1904 [[Suomen Gummitehdas]] (''Finnish Rubber Works''), a [[rubber]] business founded by [[Eduard Polón]], established a factory near the town of Nokia and used its name.

In 1922, Nokia Ab entered into a partnership with Finnish Rubber Works and [[Kaapelitehdas]] (''the Cable Factory''), all now jointly under the leadership of Polón. Finnish Rubber Works company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply, and the cable company soon did too.

Nokia at the time also made [[respirator]]s for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gasmasklexikon.com/Page/Start01.htm|title=Start01|website=Gasmasklexikon.com|access-date=23 November 2016}}</ref>

===1967–1990===
[[File:Patteriston komentopaikka Hämeenlinna 4.JPG|thumb|LV 317M military radio in the Hämeenlinna artillery museum]]

In 1967, the three companies – Nokia, Kaapelitehdas and Finnish Rubber Works – merged and created a new Nokia Corporation, restructured into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for [[Finnish Defence Forces|Finland's defence forces]] (''Puolustusvoimat''), such as the [[Sanomalaite M/90]] communicator in 1983, and the [[M61 gas mask]] first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making [[professional mobile radio]]s, [[telephone switch]]es, [[capacitors]] and [[chemicals]].

After Finland's trade agreement with the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic [[telephone exchange]]s to [[robotics]] among others; by the late 1970s the [[Soviet Union]] became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield high profits. Nokia also co-operated on scientific technology with the Soviet Union. The U.S. government became increasingly suspicious of that co-operation after the end of the [[Cold War]] [[détente]] in the early 1980s. Nokia imported many US-made components and used them for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, [[Richard Perle]], Nokia had a secret co-operation with [[The Pentagon]] that allowed the U.S. to keep track of technology developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/us_threatened_to_block_finnish_arms_deal_over_high-tech_exports_in_1980s/5710542|title=U.S. Threatened to Block Finnish Arms Deal Over High-Tech Exports in 1980's}}</ref> This was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.

In 1977, [[Kari Kairamo]] became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time, Finland was becoming what has been called "Nordic Japan". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies including television maker [[Salora (Finnish company)|Salora]] in 1984, followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker [[Luxor AB]] in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind [[Philips]] and [[Thomson SA|Thomson]]). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.

In 1987, Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's [[Standard Elektrik Lorenz]] (SEL), which included its "Schaub-Lorenz" and "Graetz" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate [[International Telephone & Telegraph]] (ITT), and after the acquisition products were sold under the "ITT Nokia" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE), the predecessor of [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]], in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

On 1 April 1988, Nokia bought the computer division of [[Ericsson]]'s Information Systems,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/21/business/company-news-nokia-oy-buys-stake-in-ericsson.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Nokia Oy Buys Stake in Ericsson|last=Reuters|date=21 January 1988|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 August 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer [[Saab Group|Saab]] called [[Datasaab]]. Ericsson Information Systems made [[Alfaskop]] terminals, [[typewriter]]s, [[minicomputer]]s and Ericsson-branded [[IBM compatible PC]]s. The merger with Nokia's Information Systems division—which since 1981 had a line of personal computers called [[MikroMikko]]—resulted in the name Nokia Data.

Nokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the [[Nordic Mobile Telephone]] (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international [[roaming]]. In 1982, Mobira launched the [[Mobira Senator]] car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]]'s gadgets: improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions, Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. CEO Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.

In 1987, [[Kaapelitehdas]] discontinued production of cables at its [[Helsinki]] factory after 44 years, effectively shutting down the sub-company.

===1990–2010===
[[File:Jorma Ollila 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jorma Ollila]], who oversaw the rise of Nokia in the mobile phone market as CEO from 1992 to 2006]]

Following [[Simo Vuorilehto]]'s appointment as CEO, a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. [[Nokian Tyres]] (''Nokian Renkaat''), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to [[UK]]-based [[International Computers Limited]] (ICL), the precursor of [[Fujitsu Siemens]]. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sank as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its [[Early 1990s depression in Finland|worst recession in living memory]], and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse]] of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.

Vuorilehto quit in January 1992 and was replaced by [[Jorma Ollila]], who had been the head of the mobile phone business from 1990 and advised against selling that division. Ollila decided to turn Nokia into a '[[Telecommunication|telecom]]-oriented' company, and he eventually got rid of divisions like the power business. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years. Nokia's operating profit went from negative in 1991 to $1 billion in 1995 and almost $4 billion by 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/05/01/278948/index.htm|title=Nokia's Secret Code Perhaps the least hierarchical big company in the world, Nokia has been winning big in wireless. But its Finnish recipe for innovation is about to be put to the test. – May 1, 2000|website=Archive.fortune.com}}</ref>

Nokia's first fully portable mobile phone after the Mobira Senator was the [[Mobira Cityman 900]] in 1987. Nokia assisted in the development of the [[GSM]] mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with [[Siemens]], the predecessor to [[Nokia Siemens Network]]. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister [[Harri Holkeri]] on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900&nbsp;MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by [[Radiolinja]]. In November 1992, the [[Nokia 1011]] launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1997/10/17/nokias-pioneering-gsm-research-and-development-to-be-awarded-by-eduard-rhein-foundation|title=Nokia´s Pioneering GSM Research and Development to be Awarded by Eduard Rhein Foundation |publisher=Nokia}}</ref>

Salora Oy as a Nokia subsidiary ended in 1989 when the division was merged into Nokia-Mobira Oy. The brand continued to be used for televisions until 1995.

On 12 June 1996, Nokia announced the sale of its [[television]] business to Canada/Hong Kong-based [[Semi-Tech Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1996/06/12/nokia-announces-heads-of-agreement-to-sell-its-remaining-television-business|title=Nokia Announces Heads of Agreement to Sell Its Remaining Television Business  |publisher=Nokia}}</ref> The television manufacturing plant in Germany closed down in September 1996. The sale included a factory in [[Turku]], and the rights to use the Nokia, [[Finlux]], [[Luxor AB|Luxor]], [[Salora Oy|Salora]], [[Schaub-Lorenz]] and Oceanic brands until the end of 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1996/07/17/nokia-announces-final-sale-of-its-television-manufacturing-business|title=Nokia Announces Final Sale of its Television Manufacturing Business |publisher=Nokia}}</ref> Some of these brands were later sold to other companies.

In 1998, Nokia co-founded [[Symbian Ltd.]] led by [[Psion (company)|Psion]] to create a new operating system for [[PDA]]s and smart mobile phones as a successor of [[EPOC32]]. They released the [[Nokia 9210 Communicator]] running [[Symbian OS]] in 2001 and later that year created the Symbian [[S60 (software platform)|Series 60]] platform, later introducing it with their first [[camera phone]], the [[Nokia 7650]].

Nokia was one of the pioneers of [[mobile gaming]] due to the popularity of ''[[Snake (video game)|Snake]]'', which came pre-loaded on many products.

==Controversies==
===NSN's provision of intercept capability to Iran===
In 2008, [[Nokia Siemens Networks]], a joint venture between Nokia and [[Siemens|Siemens AG]], reportedly provided [[Iran]]'s monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8112550.stm|title=Hi-tech helps Iranian monitoring|last=Cellan-Jones|first=Rory|date=22 June 2009|work=BBC News|access-date=14 July 2009}}</ref> The technology reportedly allowed Iran to use [[deep packet inspection]] to read and change the content of emails, social media, and online phone calls. The technology "enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/irans-web-spying-aided-western-technology|title=Iran’s Web Spying Aided By Western Technology |publisher=YaleGlobal Online |access-date=22 May 2017}}</ref>

During the [[2009 Iranian presidential election protests|post-election protests in Iran in June 2009]], Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, which experts suspected was due to use of deep packet inspection.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124562668777335653 |title=Iran's Web Spying Aided By Western Technology|last=Rhoads|first=Christopher|author2=Chao, Loretta |date=22 June 2009|work=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc.|pages=A1|access-date=14 July 2009}}</ref>

In July 2009, Nokia began to experience a [[boycott]] of their products and services in [[Iran]]. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning [[SMS|SMS messaging]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/14/nokia-boycott-iran-election-protests|title=Iranian consumers boycott Nokia for 'collaboration'|last=Kamali Dehghan|first=Saeed|date=14 July 2009|work=The Guardian |access-date=27 July 2009 | location=London}}</ref>

Nokia Siemens Networks asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a "lawful intercept capability solely for monitoring of local voice calls" and that it "has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship, or Internet filtering capability to Iran".<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.nokiasiemensnetworks.com/global/Press/Press+releases/news-archive/Provision+of+Lawful+Intercept+capability+in+Iran.htm |title=Provision of Lawful Intercept capability in Iran |date=22 June 2009 |publisher=Nokia Siemens Networks |access-date=14 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625174434/http://www.nokiasiemensnetworks.com/global/Press/Press+releases/news-archive/Provision+of+Lawful+Intercept+capability+in+Iran.htm |archive-date=25 June 2009 }}</ref>

===Lex Nokia===
In 2009, Nokia heavily supported a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees' electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/06/finland_nokia_snooping/|title='Lex Nokia' company snoop law passes in Finland|last=Ozimek|first=John|date=6 March 2009|website=The Register|access-date=27 July 2009}}</ref> Nokia denied rumors that the company had considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic [[surveillance]] were not changed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/35783.php|title=Nokia Denies Threat to Leave Finland|date=1 February 2009|publisher=cellular-news|access-date=27 July 2009}}</ref> The Finnish media dubbed the law ''Lex Nokia'' because it was implemented as a result of Nokia's pressure.

The law was enacted, but with strict requirements for implementation of its provisions. No company had used its provisions prior to 25 February 2013, when the Office of Data Protection Ombudsman confirmed that city of [[Hämeenlinna]] had recently given the required notice.<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/talous/Lex+Nokian+käytöstä+ilmoitettiin+ensimmäistä+kertaa/a1361762941046 Lex Nokian käytöstä ilmoitettiin ensimmäistä kertaa – Lex Nokia – Talous – Helsingin Sanomat]</ref>

===Nokia–Apple patent dispute===
In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against [[Apple Inc.]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Delaware|U.S. District Court of Delaware]] claiming that Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.<ref name="Nokia-Apple">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE60H05R20100118?type=marketsNews|title=SCENARIOS-What lies ahead in Nokia vs Apple legal battle|last=Virki|first=Tarmo|date=18 January 2010|work=Reuters|access-date=25 January 2010}}</ref> Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple's general counsel, [[Bruce Sewell]] went a step further by stating, "Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours." This resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the [[United States International Trade Commission|U.S. International Trade Commission]] (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in "virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theandroid.in/nokias-new-patent-suit-against-apple/|title=The war of the Smartphones: Nokia's new patent suit against Apple|date=6 January 2010|work=Snartphone Reviews|access-date=25 January 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709014240/http://www.theandroid.in/nokias-new-patent-suit-against-apple/|archive-date=9 July 2015}}</ref> Nokia went on to ask the court to ban all U.S. imports of the Apple products, including the [[iPhone]], [[Macintosh]] and [[iPod]]. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010.<ref name="Nokia-Apple"/>

In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/personal-tech/smart-phones/230600172|title=Nokia's Patent Settlement With Apple Won't Help Much|date=14 June 2011 |access-date=29 June 2011}}</ref> The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/14/apple-nokia-patent-lawsuit-settlement_n_876499.html|title=Apple Settles With Nokia in Patent Lawsuit|date=14 June 2011|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=29 June 2011|first=Catharine|last=Smith}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-14/nokia-apple-payments-to-nokia-settle-all-litigation.html|title=Nokia Wins Apple Patent-License Deal Cash, Settles Lawsuits|date=14 June 2011|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|access-date=29 June 2011|first1=Diana|last1=ben-Aaron|first2=Kati|last2=Pohjanpalo}}</ref>

===Alleged tax evasion in India===
Nokia's Indian subsidiary was charged in January 2013 with non-payment of Indian [[Tax Deducted at Source]] and transgressing [[transfer pricing]] norms in India.<ref>{{cite news|title=Income Tax department asks Nokia to pay Rs 13,000 crore|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/Income-Tax-department-asks-Nokia-to-pay-Rs-13000-crore/articleshow/18268748.cms|newspaper=Economic Times|access-date=31 January 2013|date=31 January 2013}}<br />{{cite news|title=Nokia tax case: IT officials grill Price Waterhouse|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/industry-and-economy/info-tech/nokia-tax-case-it-officials-grill-price-waterhouse/article4312124.ece|newspaper=Business Line|access-date=31 January 2013|author=T. E.

=== Nokia 7 Plus data breach ===
In March 2019, news broke that the company's [[Nokia 7 Plus]] phones were allegedly sending personal user data to [[China]] over several months. According to investigators, the gadget sent unencrypted data packages including geographical location, [[SIM card]] number and the phone's serial number to an unidentified Chinese server every time that "the phone was turned on, the screen activated or unlocked."<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Norske telefoner sendte personopplysninger til Kina|url=https://nrkbeta.no/2019/03/21/norske-telefoner-sendte-personopplysninger-til-kina/|access-date=2020-09-18|website=NRKbeta}}</ref> The data was sufficient to follow the movements and actions of the phone in real time.<ref name=":1" />

Nokia brand owner [[HMD Global]] denied any such transfers had taken place, stating that it was instead the result of an error in the packing process of the phone's software.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ranosa|first=Ted|date=2019-03-25|title=Nokia Says It Mistakenly Collected And Sent User Data To China|url=https://www.techtimes.com/articles/240231/20190325/nokia-says-it-mistakenly-collected-and-sent-user-data-to-china.htm|access-date=2020-09-18|website=Tech Times|language=en}}</ref> The Finnish Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman launched an investigation into the matter on the assumption "that personal data has been transferred."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Finland investigating Nokia for alleged GDPR violations|url=https://www.techspot.com/news/79308-finland-investigating-nokia-alleged-gdpr-violations.html|access-date=2020-09-18|website=TechSpot|language=en-US}}</ref>
