It was released as a single with "[[The Works (Queen album)#"I Go Crazy"|I Go Crazy]]" by Brian May as the B-side. It was included on the album ''[[The Works (Queen album)|The Works]]''. The song is also featured on the band's compilation albums ''[[Greatest Hits II (Queen album)|Greatest Hits II]]'' and ''[[Classic Queen]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title= Classic Queen by Queen |publisher= [[MTV]].

The single was a worldwide success for the band, reaching number one in 19 countries, number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and the [[Kent Music Report|Australian Kent Music Report]] and number 16 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="BL">{{cite book|first= Barry |last= Lazell |title= Rock movers & shakers |publisher= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Publications, Inc.]] |year= 1989 |page= 404 |isbn= 978-0-8230-7608-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Queen Biography for 1984 |publisher= QueenZone.com |url= http://www.queenzone.com/biography/queen-biography-for-1984.aspx |accessdate= 24 July 2013}}</ref> The band performed the song at every concert from 1984 to their last concert with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] in 1986, including their performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985.<ref name="BBC"/><ref name="PS">{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Stanford |title= Queen: their finest moment at Live Aid |newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/8785536/Queen-their-finest-moment-at-Live-Aid.html |date= 24 September 2011 |accessdate= 24 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Queen live on tour: The Works 1985 |publisher= Queen Concerts |accessdate= 24 July 2013 |url= http://www.queenconcerts.com/live/queen/works1985.html}}</ref><ref name="MT">{{cite web|title= Queen live on tour: Magic tour |url= http://www.queenconcerts.com/live/queen/magic.html |publisher= Queen Concerts |accessdate= 24 July 2013}}</ref>

The [[music video]] for the song uses footage from the 1927 [[silent film|silent]] [[science fiction]] film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. It received heavy rotation on music channels and was nominated for an [[1984 MTV Video Music Awards#Best Art Direction in a Video|MTV Video Music Award]] in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|first= Jeff |last= Giles |title= That Time Classic Rock Cleaned Up at the First-Ever MTV Video Music Awards |website= Ultimate Classic Rock |url= http://ultimateclassicrock.com/classic-rock-mtv-video-music-awards/ |accessdate= 26 May 2018}}</ref>

==Meaning==
"Radio Ga Ga" was released in 1984. It was a commentary on television overtaking [[Radio broadcasting|radio's]] popularity and how one would listen to radio in the past for a favourite comedy, drama, or science fiction programme. It also addressed the advent of the music video and [[MTV]], which was then competing with radio as an important medium for promoting records. At the [[1984 MTV Video Music Awards]] the video for "Radio Ga Ga" would receive a Best Art Direction nomination.<ref>{{cite web|title= Rock On The Net: 1984 MTV Video Music Awards |url= http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1984/mtvvmas.htm |website= Rock on the Net |accessdate= 24 July 2013}}</ref> Roger Taylor was quoted:

{{quote|That's part of what the song's about, really. The fact that they [music videos] seem to be taking over almost from the aural side, the visual side seems to be almost more important.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUbA3AgzPUQ |title= Roger Taylor & John Deacon – 1984 Breakfast Time Interview |publisher= [[YouTube]] |accessdate= 22 November 2013}}</ref>}}

The song makes reference to two important radio events of the 20th century; [[Orson Welles]]' 1938 broadcast of [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'' in the lyric "through wars of worlds/invaded by Mars", and [[Winston Churchill]]'s 18 June 1940 "[[This was their finest hour]]" speech from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], in the lyric "You've yet to have your finest hour".<ref>{{cite book|first= Todd |last= Avery |title= Radio Modernism: Literature, Ethics, and the BBC 1922-1938 |publisher= [[Ashgate Publishing]] |year= 2006 |page= 137 |isbn= 978-0-7546-5517-6}}</ref>

==Recording==
[[Image:The Plant - Sausalito - front door 2.jpg|thumb|right|188px|Queen and producer Mack recorded the song at [[Record Plant]] Studios, Los Angeles through August and early September 1983]]

The inspiration for this song came when Roger Taylor heard his son utter the words "radio ca-ca" while listening to a bad song on the radio while they were in Los Angeles.<ref>Roger Taylor speaking in the documentary ''Queen – Days of Our Lives''</ref> After hearing the phrase, Taylor began writing the song when he locked himself in a room with a [[Roland Jupiter-8]] and a [[drum machine]] ([[Linn LM-1]]). He thought it would fit his solo album, but when the band heard it, [[John Deacon]] wrote a [[bassline]] and [[Freddie Mercury]] reconstructed the track, thinking it could be a big hit. Taylor then took a skiing holiday and let Mercury polish the lyrics, harmony, and arrangements of the song. Recording sessions began at [[Record Plant]] Studios in Los Angeles in August 1983 – the band's only time recording in North America.<ref>{{cite book|first= Georg |last= Purvis |year= 2007 |title= Queen: Complete Works |publisher= Reynolds & Hearn |page= 236}}</ref> It included Canadian session keyboardist [[Fred Mandel]]. Mandel programmed the Jupiter's arpeggiated synth-bass parts. The recording features prominent use of the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] VP330+ [[vocoder]]. The bassline was produced by a [[Roland Jupiter-8]], using the built-in [[Synthesizer#Arpeggiator|arpeggiator]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Instruments on Queen and solo tours |url= http://www.queenconcerts.com/instruments/1985-works.html |publisher= Queen Concerts |accessdate= 24 July 2013}}</ref>

==Video==
[[Image:Shepperton Studios.jpg|thumb|right|188px|[[Shepperton Studios]], London, where the video was shot by [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]] in November 1983]]
[[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]]'s [[music video]] for the song features scenes from [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 [[German Expressionism|German expressionist]] [[science fiction]] film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' and was filmed at Carlton TV Studios and [[Shepperton Studios]], London, between 23/24 November 1983 and January 1984.<ref name="PV">{{cite web|title= Queen Promo Videos |url= http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/videos/promo-videos.htm |publisher= Ultimatequeen.co.uk |accessdate= 24 July 2013}}</ref> It features the band in a car flying over the [[Metropolis (1927 film)#Plot|title city]] and later performing the song in front of the city's working class, interspersed with a family in their dining room listening to the radio while wearing gas masks. Freddie Mercury's solo song "[[Love Kills (Freddie Mercury song)|Love Kills]]" was used in [[Giorgio Moroder]]'s [[Metropolis (1927 film)#Restorations|restored version]] of the film and in exchange Queen were granted the rights to use footage from it in their "Radio Ga Ga" video. However, Queen had to buy performance rights to the film from the [[Communism|communist]] [[East Germany|East German]] government, which was the copyright holder at the time.<ref>{{cite web|first1= Greg |last1= Brooks |first2= Gary |last2= Taylor |title= The Works – Album Details |url= http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/discography/works/ |publisher= Queenonline.com |accessdate= 24 July 2013}}</ref> At the end of the music video, the words "Thanks To Metropolis" appear. The video also features footage from earlier Queen promo videos.<ref name="PV"/>

==Live versions==

Queen finished their sets before the encores on [[The Works Tour]] with "Radio Ga Ga" and Mercury would normally sing "you had your time" in a lower octave and modify the deliveries of "you had the power, you've yet to have your finest hour" while Roger Taylor sang the pre-chorus in the high octave. Live versions from the 1984/85 tour were recorded and filmed for the concert films Queen ''[[Rock in Rio]]'' 1985 and ''[[We Are the Champions: Final Live in Japan|Final Live in Japan]]'' 1985.<ref>{{cite book|first= Georg |last= Purvis |title= Queen: Complete Works |year= 2007 |publisher= Reynolds & Hearn |page= 321 |isbn= 978-1-90528-733-8}}</ref> As heard on bootleg recordings, Deacon can be heard providing backing vocals to the song; it is one of the very few occasions he sang in concert.

Queen played a shorter, up-tempo version of "Radio Ga Ga" during the [[Live Aid]] concert on 13 July 1985 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], where Queen's "show-stealing performance" had 72,000 people clapping in unison.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|title= Queen win greatest live gig poll |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4420308.stm |publisher= [[BBC News Online]] |accessdate= 24 July 2013 |date= 9 November 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= Ryan Minchin, dir.|title= Queen Voted Best Gig-Live Aid |year= 2005 |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob5NpdkH5Dw |publisher= [[YouTube]] |accessdate= 24 July 2013}}</ref> It was the second song the band performed at Live Aid after opening with "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]".<ref name="PS"/><ref>{{cite web|title= Queen live on tour: Festivals, parties, TV |url= http://www.queenconcerts.com/live/queen/other.html |publisher= Queen Concerts |accessdate= 24 July 2013}}</ref> "Radio Ga Ga" became a live favourite thanks largely to the audience participation potential of the clapping sequence prompted by the rhythm of the chorus (copied from the video). Mercury sang all high notes in this version. The song was played for the [[Magic Tour (Queen)|Magic Tour]] a year later, including twice more at Wembley Stadium; it was recorded for the live album ''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'', VHS Video and DVD on 12 July 1986, the second night in the venue.<ref name="MT"/>

[[Paul Young]] performed the song with Queen at [[the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]] again at Wembley Stadium on 20 April 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/videos/the-freddie-mercury-tribute-concert-10th-anniversary-reissue.htm#radio |title= The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert |publisher= Ultimatequeen.co.uk |accessdate= 24 July 2013}}</ref> At the "[[Party at the Palace]]" concert, celebrating Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee in 2002, "Radio Ga Ga" opened up Queen's set with Roger Taylor on vocals and [[Phil Collins]] on the drums.<ref>{{cite web|title= Queen Miscellaneous Live Song Lyrics |accessdate= 24 July 2013 |publisher= Ultimatequeen.co.uk |url= http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/songs/miscellaneous-live.htm#radiopp}}</ref>

This song was played on the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour]] in 2005–2006 and sung by Roger Taylor and [[Paul Rodgers]]. It was recorded officially at the [[Motorpoint Arena Sheffield|Hallam FM Arena]] in Sheffield on 5 May 2005. The result, ''[[Return of the Champions]]'', was released on CD and DVD on 19 September 2005 and 17 October 2005. It was also played on the [[Rock the Cosmos Tour]] during late 2008, this time with only Rodgers on lead vocals. The concert album ''[[Live in Ukraine]]'' came as a result of this tour, yet the song is not available on the CD or DVD versions released 15 June 2009. This performance of "Radio Ga Ga" is only available as a digital download from iTunes. It was again played on the [[Queen + Adam Lambert]] Tour with Lambert on lead vocals.

==Cover versions==
* The song was covered in 2004 by [[Electric Six]]. The band released the song as a single against their wishes under pressure from their label at the time, although the song had been in their repertoire during the band's early Wildbunch days. The video depicts Electric Six frontman, Dick Valentine, as the ghost of [[Freddie Mercury]] dancing near his own grave. It was widely misinterpreted that Valentine (as Mercury) was dancing on his grave. He explains on his website's video section "Though some have claimed this video portrays me dancing on Freddie Mercury's grave, actually it's more like we are resurrecting Mr. Mercury for the duration of the song and his grave is the logical starting point."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://electricsix.com/ |title= Electric Six – Music + Videos |accessdate= 24 July 2013}}</ref>
