'''Jerzy Karol Buzek''' {{IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Jerzy Buzek.ogg|'|j|e|rz|y|-|'|b|u|z|e|k}} (born 3 July 1940) is a [[Polish people|Polish]] [[politician]] and [[Member of the European Parliament]] from [[Poland]]. He has served as [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland|Prime Minister of Poland]] from 1997 to 2001, since being elected to the [[European Parliament]] in 2004, he has served as [[President of the European Parliament]] between 2009 and 2012.<ref name="BBCElectionPres"/> He is married to Ludgarda Buzek<ref>{{cite web|last=Buzek|first=Ludgarda|title=BIP (Biuletyn Informacji Publicznej)|url=http://bip.slaskie.pl/index.php?grupa=8&identpodzial=49|accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref> and is the father of Polish actress [[Agata Buzek]].

== Early years ==
Jerzy Karol Buzek was born to a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] family on 3 July 1940 in [[Smilovice (Frýdek-Místek District)|Smilovice]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (under the [[Nazi Germany|National Socialist German]] occupation).<ref>The Smilovice (German: Smilowitz, Polish: Śmiłowice) village lies in the region historically known as [[Austrian Silesia]], more precisely the [[Zaolzie]] region. This territory was until 1918 part of [[Austria-Hungary]] ([[Cisleithania|Austrian part]]), then from November 1918 part of Poland, then from 1920 part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. After the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938 Czechoslovakia was forced to transfer the Zaolzie region to Poland, which, after the 1939 German invasion of Poland, was annexed by Germany. After World War II it became again a part of Czechoslovakia and, since 1993, part of the Czech Republic. Buzek hails from the [[Polish minority in Zaolzie]]. At the time of his birth, it was officially named Smilowitz and was occupied by Germany as part of [[Landkreis Teschen]].</ref> He was born into the prominent Buzek family, which participated in Polish politics in the [[Second Polish Republic]] during the [[interbellum]]. The family was part of the [[Polish minority in Zaolzie|Polish community in Zaolzie]].<ref name=zaolzie>{{cite news | first = Włodzimierz | last = Nowak | url = http://wyborcza.pl/1,75248,6792766,Nad_Betlejem__nad_Rola_kometa__Zaolzianska_saga_rodu.html | title = Nad Betlejem, nad Rolą kometa. Zaolziańska saga rodu Buzków | date = 6 July 2009 | work=[[Gazeta Wyborcza]] | accessdate =14 July 2009}}</ref> Buzek's father was an engineer. After the [[Second World War]], his family moved to [[Chorzów]]. He is a [[Lutheran]].

== Professional career ==
In 1963 Jerzy Buzek graduated from the Mechanics-and-Energy Division of the [[Silesian University of Technology]], specialising in [[chemical engineering]]. He became a scientist in the Chemical Engineering Institute of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]. Since 1997 he has been a professor of technical science. He is also an honorary doctor of the universities in [[Seoul]] and [[Dortmund]] among others.<ref>{{cite web|title=JERZY BUZEK|url=http://www.eppgroup.eu/mep/Jerzy-BUZEK|publisher=EPP Group in the EP|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref>

From 1997 to 2001, Buzek was a coalition [[Prime Minister of Poland]].

In 1998 he became the first laureate of the Grzegorz Palka Award<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ligakrajowa.org.pl/nagroda_grzegorza_palki/1/offset=32/Nagroda-im-G-Palki.html |title=NAGRODA IM. G. PALKI |access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref> and was nominated ''European of the Year'' by the European Union Business Chambers Forum.

In 1998 he was named 'Person of the Year' by the influential Polish political weekly ''[[Wprost]]''. He won the award for a second time in 2009. On receiving the award again, as President of the European Parliament, he stressed that he was the first winner to be honoured for his work beyond the borders of Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/kat,1342,title,Jerzy-Buzek-Czlowiekiem-Roku-tygodnika-Wprost,wid,11872962,wiadomosc_prasa.html?ticaid=1c0db |title=Jerzy Buzek Człowiekiem Roku tygodnika "Wprost" – Wiadomości – WP.PL |publisher=Wiadomosci.wp.pl |accessdate=4 June 2011}}</ref>

He was the first Prime Minister of the 3rd Republic of Poland to serve a full term.

After losing the parliamentary elections in 2001, he stepped back from political life and focused more on his scientific work, becoming the prorector of [[Akademia Polonijna]] in [[Częstochowa]] and professor in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of the [[Opole University of Technology]] in [[Opole]].

His return to political life in 2004 saw him gain the largest popular vote in Poland as the member for [[Katowice]] to the [[European Parliament]] standing for the [[Civic Platform]].

Whilst [[President of the European Parliament]], on 30 March 2011, he was awarded an honorary fellowship of the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]] at a meeting of the [[European Federation of Chemical Engineering]] (EFCE) in [[Brussels]], Belgium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcetoday.com/latest%20news/2011/march/icheme%20honours%20european%20president.aspx |title=Sorry |publisher=Tcetoday.com |accessdate=4 June 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

== Political career ==
In the 1980s, Buzek was an activist of the [[anti-communist]] movements, including the legal (1980–1981 and since 1989) and underground (1981–1989) [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity trade union]] and political movement in [[People's Republic of Poland|communist Poland]]. He was an active organiser of the trade union's regional and national underground authorities. He was also the chairman of the four national general meetings (1st, 4th, 5th and 6th) when the Solidarity movement was allowed to participate in the political process again.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/former_ep_presidents/president-buzek/en/the_president/biography.html |title=Biography of the President of the European Parliament |access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>

Jerzy Buzek was a member of the [[Solidarity Electoral Action]] (AWS) and co-author of the AWS's economic program. After the [[1997 Polish parliamentary election|1997 elections]] he was elected to the [[Sejm]], the lower house of the Polish Parliament, and was soon appointed [[Prime Minister of Poland]]. In 1999 he became the chairman of the [[AWS Social Movement]] (Ruch Społeczny AWS) and in 2001 he became the Chairman of the Solidarity Electoral Action coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.europarl.europa.eu/former_ep_presidents/president-buzek/en/the_president/biography.html |title=Biography of the President of the European Parliament |access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>

=== Jerzy Buzek's government ===
Between the years 1997–2001 he was the Prime Minister of Poland, first of the right-centrist AWS–[[Freedom Union (Poland)|Freedom Union]] coalition government until 2001, and then of the rightist AWS minority government. His cabinet's major achievements were four significant political and economic reforms: a new local government and administration division of Poland, reform of the pension system, reform of the educational system, and reform of the medical care system.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDx0Ak4xnOQC&q=jerzy+buzek+educational+pension+reform&pg=PA144 |title=Transition by Mario I.

Buzek resigned as the chairman of AWS Social Movement, and was replaced by [[Mieczysław Janowski]].

=== Polish Member of the European Parliament ===
On 13 June 2004, in the [[2004 European Parliament election in Poland|European Parliament election, 2004]], Jerzy Buzek was elected a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) from the [[Silesian (European Parliament constituency)|Silesian Voivodeship]], basing his candidacy only on the popularity of his name and on direct contact with the voters. He received a record number of votes, 173,389 (22.14% of the total votes in the region). His current party affiliation is with the [[Civic Platform]], which is a member of the [[European People's Party]].

In the 2004–2009 European Parliament, he was a member of the [[Committee on Industry, Research and Energy]], an alternate member of the [[Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety]], a member of the Delegation to the EU–[[Ukraine]] Parliamentary Cooperation Committee, and an alternate delegate for the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America. He served as rapporteur on the EU's 7th Framework Programme for Research and Development, a multibillion-euro spending programme for the years 2007–2013.

On 7 June 2009, in the [[2009 European Parliament election in Poland|European Parliament election, 2009]], Buzek was re-elected as a Member of the [[European Parliament]] from the [[Silesian Voivodeship]] constituency. Just as in the previous election, Buzek received a record number of votes in Poland: 393,117 (over 42% of the total votes in the district). On 12 September 2018, he voted in favor of approving the controversial [[Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+PV+20180912+RES-RCV+DOC+PDF+V0//EN|title=Result of roll-call votes|website=europarl.europa.eu|format=PDF|accessdate=14 September 2018}}</ref>

=== President of the European Parliament ===

On 14 July 2009, Buzek was elected [[President of the European Parliament]] with 555 votes of the 644 votes cast, the largest majority ever,<ref>{{cite web |author=cs |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/view/en/the_president/biography.html |title=Jerzy Buzek – Biography of the President of the European Parliament : Jerzy Buzek |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=4 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527151015/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/view/en/the_president/biography.html |archivedate=27 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> becoming the first person from the former [[Eastern Bloc]] and the first former Prime Minister since [[Pierre Pflimlin]] to gain that position.<ref name="BBCElectionPres">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8148729.stm|title=Euro parliament elects new leader |date=14 July 2009|work=BBC News  |accessdate=14 July 2009}}</ref> He succeeded the German [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democrat]] MEP, [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]].<ref name="BBCElectionPres"/> He pledged to make human rights and the promotion of the Eastern partnership two of his priorities during his term of office, which will last two and a half years until, due to a political deal, Social Democrat MEP [[Martin Schulz]] will take over.<ref name="BBCElectionPres"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2011}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090714-703860.html |title=UPDATE: EU Parliament Elects Ex-Polish PM Buzek As President * Article |last=Henson |first=Carolyn |date=14 July 2009 |work=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=14 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719080729/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090714-703860.html |archivedate=19 July 2009 }}</ref>

In his inaugural address in Strasbourg, Buzek stated that among the greatest challenges faced by the European parliament were the economic crisis, European solidarity, human rights and reform within the Parliament itself.<ref>Buzek, Jerzy: "Inaugural speech by Jerzy Buzek following his election as President of the European Parliament", EP Press Release, 14 July 2009: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/en/press/speeches/sp-2009/sp-2009-July/speeches-2009-July-1.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Retrieved: 2011-12-06</ref> Buzek also stated he would be committed to reform of the European economy, tackling rising unemployment, energy security and climate change, strengthening European solidarity and integration and promoting equal opportunities for women. However, Buzek noted that the [[Lisbon Treaty]] would be a prerequisite to any change "(so that the Union can be) well-organised and effective".<ref>Buzek, Jerzy. "Inaugural speech by Jerzy Buzek following his election as President of the European Parliament", 14 July 2009 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/en/press/speeches/sp-2009/sp-2009-July/speeches-2009-July-1.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

On 8 December 2009 Buzek was awarded by the Ministerpräsident of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Dr. [[Jürgen Rüttgers]], the annual "Staatspreis award". The prize was awarded in honor of his lifetime achievements and highlighted the European Parliament as a "motor of integration." Affirming his commitment to the Eastern Partnership and "those who do not have the possibility to participate in our European integration project", Buzek announced that the prize money would be donated to the [[European Humanities University]] (EHU), A Belarusian university in exile in Vilnius.<ref>Buzek, Jerzy: "President Buzek to receive prestigious prize from North Rhine-Westphalia – prize money to be donated to Belarusian University in exile", EP press release, 7 December 2009: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/de-en/press/press_release/2009/2009-November/press_release-2009-November-33.html;jsessionid=65C948AAA96808C44D5CB45A18E2F8C5, Retrieved: 2011-12-14</ref>

The [[Lisbon Treaty]], which came into force on 1 December 2009 shortly after Buzek assumed office, brought a conclusion to nearly a decade of internal discussions and greatly boosted the democratic powers of the European Parliament. From very early on Buzek has been a vocal supporter of the treaty as part of a wider push for greater political integration in Europe.<ref>Buzek, Jerzy: "President Jerzy Buzek's speech at commemorative event marking the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon", 1 Dec 2009, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/en/press/speeches/sp-2009/sp-2009-November/speeches-2009-November-7.html, Retrieved: 2011-12-06</ref> The rise in legislative powers under the treaty in fact represents almost a doubling in power.<ref name="europarl.europa.eu">[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/0042423726/Parliament-and-the-Lisbon-Treaty.html European Parliament & The Lisbon Treaty] Retrieved: 2011-12-06.</ref> Since its introduction Parliament has equal rights with the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] over 40 new fields within the "co-decision" procedure, such as agriculture, energy security, immigration, justice and home affairs, health and structural funds.<ref name="europarl.europa.eu"/>

In late 2011 Buzek's presidency also endorsed the '[[Sixpack (European Union law)|Sixpack]]' legislation on economic governance to tackle the growing Eurozone crisis. This was a follow-up on the earlier [[Stability and Growth Pact]] and the [[Euro Plus Pact]] intended as a means of optimising macroeconomic surveillance in Europe and avoiding crises in the eurozone in the future.<ref>eurotribune.eu, 2011-09-28: "The European Parliament adopts "six-pack" economic governance legislative package", http://www.eurotribune.eu/index.default.php/?p=20642, Retrieved: 2011-12-09</ref> Welcoming the parliament's adoption of the legislation on 28 October 2011, Buzek stated: "The adoption of the six-pack by the whole European Parliament is good news for the European Union. We have a new economic rule-book. We have developed a powerful and resistant armour against any future crises. With the adoption of the six-pack, the EU significantly strengthens its budget discipline and moves towards a true economic governance. We can not turn the clock back, but the package will ensure that Member States budgets will be credible."<ref>[https://archive.is/20120729105059/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/en/press/press_release/2011/2011-September/press_release-2011-September-21.html Buzek, Jerzy: "Six-pack on economic governance adopted"] EP Press Release (Retrieved: 2011-12-09).</ref>

One of Buzek's major challenges as EP president was dealing with the allegations of corruption, illegal lobbying and mismanagement of public funds of which several members of the European Parliament have been accused in the wake of a cash-for-amendments scandal. On 7 July 2011, the [[Conference of Presidents]] approved the first ever code of conduct for MEPs and it was officially endorsed by the parliament on 1 December 2011.<ref>Pop, Valentina: "MEPs hope to restore public trust with ethics code", http://euobserver.com/18/114475, Retrieved 7 December 2011</ref> The code sets out rules and principles that MEPs should follow in their dealings with outside parties in order to avoid conflicts of interest. "Increased powers of the European Parliament must be accompanied by an increased transparency and accountability on behalf of its members" Buzek has said of the code.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120906142359/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/en/press/press_release/2011/2011-November/press_release-2011-November-26.html Buzek, Jerzy: "Press Release – Buzek welcomes adoption of Code of Conduct for MEPs"] Retrieved 7 December 2011.</ref> According to the code, MEPs have to provide clear declarations of their paid activities outside parliament, as well as the salary they receive. They also have to declare all other activities which might constitute a conflict of interest. The code contains an explicit ban on MEPs receiving payments or other rewards in exchange for influencing parliamentary decisions. It also sets out clear rules on the acceptance of gifts and on the issue of former MEPs working as [[Lobbying|lobbyists]].<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20111201IPR32927/html/New-code-of-conduct-for-MEPs-approved "New code of conduct for MEPs approved"] Retrieved 7 December 2011.</ref>
