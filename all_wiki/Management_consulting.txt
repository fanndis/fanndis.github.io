{{short description|Practice of helping organizations to improve their performance}}
'''Management consulting''' is the practice of helping [[organization]]s to improve their [[performance management|performance]]. Organizations may draw upon the services of management [[consultants]] for a number of reasons, including gaining external (and presumably objective) advice and access to consultants' specialized expertise.

As a result of their exposure to, and relationships with numerous organizations, consulting firms are typically aware of industry "[[best practice]]s". However, the specific nature of situations under consideration may limit the ability or appropriateness of transferring such practices from one organization to another.

Consultancies may provide organizational [[change management|change-management]] assistance, development of [[coaching]] skills, [[process analysis]], [[technology]] implementation, [[strategy]] development, or operational improvement services.  Management consultants often bring their own proprietary [[methodology|methodologies]] or frameworks to guide the identification of problems, and to serve as the basis for recommendations with a view to more effective or [[efficiency (economics)|efficient]] ways of performing work tasks.

== History ==
Management consulting grew with the rise of [[management]], as a unique field of study.  One of the first management consulting firms was [[Arthur D. Little]] Inc., founded in 1886 as a partnership, and later incorporated in 1909.<ref name=Little>{{cite web|title=Scatter Acorns That Oaks May Grow|url=http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/adlittle/history.html|publisher=MIT Institute Archives & Special Collections|access-date=9 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312034626/http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/adlittle/history.html|archive-date=12 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Though Arthur D. Little later became a general management consultancy, it originally specialised in technical research.

As Arthur D. Little focused on technical research for the first few years, the first management consultancy was started by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], who in 1893 opened an independent consulting practice in Philadelphia. His business card read "Consulting Engineer – Systematizing Shop Management and Manufacturing Costs a Specialty". By inventing Scientific Management, also known as Taylor's method, Frederick Winslow Taylor invented the first method of organizing work, spawning the careers of many more management consultants. One of Taylor's early collaborators, [[Morris Llewellyn Cooke]], for example, opened his own management consultancy in 1905. Taylor's method was used worldwide until industry switched to a method invented by [[W. Edwards Deming]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The initial period of growth in the consulting industry was triggered by the [[Glass–Steagall legislation|Glass–Steagall Banking Act]] in the 1930s, and was driven by demand for advice on finance, strategy, and organization.<ref>Kipping, M. 2002. "Trapped in their wave: the evolution of management consultancies," in T. Clark and R. Fincham (eds.). ''Critical Consulting: New Perspectives on the Management Advice Industry''. Oxford: Blackwell, 28–49.</ref> From the 1950s onwards consultancies not only expanded their activities considerably in the United States but also opened offices in Europe and later in Asia and South America. After World War II, a number of new management consulting firms were formed, bringing a rigorous analytical approach to the study of management and strategy. The postwar years also saw the application of [[cybernetics]] principles to management through the work of [[Stafford Beer]].

The industry experienced significant growth in the 1980s and 1990s, gaining considerable importance in relation to national [[gross domestic product]]. In 1980 there were only five consulting firms with more than 1,000 consultants worldwide, whereas by the 1990s there were more than thirty firms of this size.<ref>Canback, S. 1998a. ''Transaction Cost Theory and Management Consulting: Why do Management Consultants Exist?'', Working Paper 9810002. Henley Management College, Henley-on-Thames.</ref>

A period of significant growth in the early 1980s was driven by demand for strategy and organization consultancies. The wave of growth in the 1990s was driven by both strategy and information technology advice. In the second half of the 1980s, the big accounting firms entered the IT consulting segment. The then Big Eight, now [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Four]], accounting firms ([[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]; [[KPMG]]; [[Ernst & Young]]; [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu]]) had always offered advice in addition to their traditional services, but after the late 1980s these activities became increasingly important in relation to the maturing market of accounting and [[auditing]]. By the mid-1990s these firms had outgrown those service providers focusing on corporate strategy and organization. While three of the Big Four legally divided the different service lines after the Enron scandals and the ensuing breakdown of Arthur Andersen, they are now back in the consulting business. In 2000, Andersen Consulting broke off from [[Arthur Andersen]] and announced their new name: [[Accenture]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newsroom.accenture.com/subjects/accenture-corporate/andersen-consulting-announces-new-name-accenture-effective-010101.htm|title=Andersen Consulting Announces New Name — Accenture — Effective 01.01.01 {{!}} Accenture Newsroom|website=newsroom.accenture.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref> The name change was effective starting January 1, 2001 and [[Accenture]] is currently the largest consulting firms in the world in employee headcount. They are publicly traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]] with ticker ACN.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/acn?ltr=1|title=ACN : Summary for Accenture plc Class A Ordinary - Yahoo Finance|website=finance.yahoo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref>

The industry stagnated in 2001 before recovering after 2003 and then enjoying a period of sustained double-digit annual revenue growth until the financial crash of 2008/9. With Financial Services and Government being two of the largest spenders on consulting services, the financial crash and the resulting public sector austerity drives hit consulting revenues hard. In some markets such as the UK there was even a recession in the consulting industry, something which had never previously happened and has not happened since. There has been a gradual recovery in the consulting industry's growth rate in the intervening years, with a current trend towards a clearer segmentation of management consulting firms. In recent years, management consulting firms actively recruit top graduates from [[Ivy League]] universities, [[Rhodes Scholars]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y78i5nkBWxgC&q=mckinsey+rhodes+scholar&pg=PA299 |title=Rhodes Scholars, Oxford, and the Creation of an American Elite – Thomas J. Schaeper, Kathleen Schaeper – Google Books |date=2010-01-15|access-date=2013-06-14|isbn=978-0-85745-369-3|last1=Schaeper |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Schaeper |first2=Kathleen }}</ref> and students from top MBA programs.

In more recent times, traditional management consulting firms have had to face increasing challenges from disruptive [[Freelance marketplace|online marketplaces]] that are aiming to cater to the increasing number of freelance management consulting professionals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2013/10/consulting-on-the-cusp-of-disruption|title=Consulting on the Cusp of Disruption|website=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2016-03-15}}</ref>

== Function ==
The functions of consulting services are commonly broken down into eight task categories.<ref>Turner, A. N. 1982. "Consulting is more than giving advice," ''Harvard Business Review'' 60/5: 120-9.</ref> Consultants can function as bridges for information and knowledge, and that external consultants can provide these bridging services more economically than client firms themselves.<ref>Bessant, J., and H. Rush 1995. "Building bridges for innovation: the role of consultants in technology transfer," ''Research Policy'' 24: 97-114.</ref> Consultants can be engaged proactively, without significant external enforcement, and reactively, with external pressure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Adizes|first1=Ichak|last2=Cudanov|first2=Mladen|last3=Rodic|first3=Dusanka|date=2017|title=Timing of Proactive Organizational Consulting: Difference between Organizational Perception and Behaviour|url=https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/169067/1/aej-v19-i44-p232.pdf|journal=Amfiteatru Economic|volume=19|issue=44|pages=232–248|via=ECONSTOR}}</ref> Proactive consultant engagement is engaged mainly with aim to find hidden weak spots and improve performance, while the reactive consultant engagement is mostly aimed at solving problems identified by external stakeholders.

[[Marvin Bower]], McKinsey's long-term director, has mentioned the benefits of a consultant's externality, that they have varied experience outside the client company.<ref>Bower, M. 1982. ''The Will to Manage''. New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref>

Consultants have specialised skills on tasks that would involve high internal co-ordination costs for clients, such as organization-wide changes or the implementation of information technology. In addition, because of [[economies of scale]], their focus and experience in gathering information worldwide and across industries renders their information search less costly than for clients.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bessant|first1=John|last2=Rush|first2=Howard|date=January 1995|title=Building bridges for innovation: the role of consultants in technology transfer|journal=Research Policy|volume=24|issue=1|pages=97–114|doi=10.1016/0048-7333(93)00751-e|issn=0048-7333}}</ref>

=== Trends ===
In 2013, an article in ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' discussed the prevalent trends within the consulting industry to evolve. The authors noted that with knowledge being democratized and information becoming more and more accessible to anyone, the role of management consultants is rapidly changing. Moreover, with more online platforms that connect business executives to relevant consultants, the role of the traditional 'firm' is being questioned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2013/10/consulting-on-the-cusp-of-disruption/|title=Consulting on the Cusp of Disruption|website=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2016-03-02}}</ref> 
== Government consultants ==

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, the use of external management consultants within government has sometimes been contentious due to perceptions of variable value for money.  From 1997 to 2006, for instance, the UK government reportedly spent £20 billion on management consultants,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|title=The Times & The Sunday Times|website=thetimes.co.uk|access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref> raising questions in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] as to the returns upon such investment.<ref name="Gov">{{cite news | title=Central government's | url =https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmpubacc/309/309.pdf | work =[[British House of Commons]] | access-date = 2007-10-19 }}</ref>

The UK has also experimented with providing longer-term use of management consultancy techniques provided internally, particularly to the high-demand consultancy arenas of local government and the [[National Health Service]]; the [[Local Government Association]]'s Improvement and Development Agency and the public health [[national support team]]s; both generated positive feedback at cost levels considered a fraction of what external commercial consultancy input would have incurred.

=== Europe ===
European Standard [[EN 16114|EN 16114:2011]] "Management consultancy services".{{Clarify|reason=|date=March 2020}}

=== Romania ===
In 2011, the Romanian management consulting industry began to re-initiate growth after a period of economic stagnation. At the end of 2010, a majority of Romania’s management consultancies had experienced declining profits and by the end of 2011 about 70% of them had noted shrinking bottom lines. 2010 and 2011 represented an important test for many Romanian consulting firms according to a European Federation of Management Consultancies Associations (FEACO) study.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feaco.org/sites/default/files/Feaco%20Survey%202010-2011.pdf|title=FEACO Survey 2010-2011 }}</ref>

In 2015, Romanian management consulting had a turnover of 350 Mln. € and an export of 10% of the overall turnover, 75% within the EU and 25% outside. The local leader of the Romanian management consulting market is Ensight Management Consulting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.zf.ro/zf-news/10-000-de-angajati-produc-venituri-de-380-de-milioane-de-euro-pe-an-pentru-firmele-de-consultanta-in-management-10887524/|title=10.000 de angajaţi produc venituri de 380 de milioane de euro pe an pentru firmele de consultanţă în management - Ziarul Financiar|website=m.zf.ro|access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feaco.org/sites/default/files/sitepagefiles/Feaco%20Survey%202014-2015_0.pdf|title=FEACO 2014-2015 survey}}</ref>

===Australia===

In 1988, the newly elected [[Nick Greiner|Greiner State Government]] commissioned a report into the [[State Rail Authority]] by [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The resulting report recommended up to 8,000 job losses, including the withdrawal of staff from 94 country railway stations, withdrawing services on the [[Main Western railway line|Nyngan- Bourke line]], [[Bombala railway line|Queanbeyan – Cooma line]] and [[Main Northern railway line|Glen Innes- Wallangarra line]], the discontinuation of several country passenger services (the ''Canberra XPT'', the ''Silver City Comet'' to [[Broken Hill]] and various diesel locomotive hauled services) and the removal of sleeper trains from services to [[Brisbane]] and [[Melbourne]]. The report also recommended the removal of all country passenger services and small freight operations, but the government did not consider this to be politically feasible.<ref>Moore, M Lagan, B. ''SRA takes axe to 8000 jobs''. [[Sydney Morning Herald]], July 14, 1989.</ref> The SRA was divided into business units – [[CityRail]], responsible for urban railways; [[CountryLink]], responsible for country passenger services; FreightRail, responsible for freight services; and Rail Estate, responsible for rail property.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand the government has historically had a greater role in providing some infrastructure and services than in some other countries.  Contributing reasons included insufficient scale in the private sector, smaller capital markets and historic political support for government service provision.  Current infrastructure investment plans are open to a range of public/private partnerships.<ref>The 30 Year New Zealand Infrastructure Plan 2015, National Infrastructure Unit, The Treasury, New Zealand Government.</ref>  New Zealand governments hire in expertise to complement the advice of professional public servants.  While management consultants contribute to policy and to strategy development, the Government tends to use management consultants for strategic review and for strategy execution.  There is a distinction<ref>Page 12, RFP All of Government Consultancy Services 28 October 2014 New Zealand Government</ref> between management consultants (who generally provide advice and fixed deliverables, often for a fixed fee) and professional contractors (who work for an hourly or daily rate providing specialist services).  Official figures from 2007 to 2009 show annual expenditure of about NZ$150 to NZ$180 Million by the [[New Zealand Government]] on consultants, but this may be understated.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ssc.govt.nz/sites/all/files/cab-paper-review-of-cap-core-govt-administration-2.pdf |title=para 16 |access-date=2014-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190127013610/http://www.ssc.govt.nz/sites/all/files/cab-paper-review-of-cap-core-govt-administration-2.pdf |archive-date=2019-01-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{qn|date=October 2015}}  While multinational consultancy firms provide advice on major projects and in specialist areas, the majority of management consultants providing advice to the New Zealand government operate as sole practitioners or as members of small consultancy practices. The range of services provided is large, covering change management, strategic review, project and programme management, procurement, organizational design, etc.

== Nonprofit consultants ==
Some for-profit consulting firms, including [[McKinsey & Company|McKinsey]] and [[Boston Consulting Group|BCG]], offer consulting services to nonprofits at subsidized rates as a form of [[corporate social responsibility]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Other for-profit firms have spun off nonprofit consulting organizations, eg. [[Bain & Company|Bain]] creating [[Bridgespan Group|Bridgespan]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/giving/11BRIDGE.html|title=A Nonprofit Consultant Offers Free Strategic Advice Online|last=Krauss|first=Alan|date=2008-11-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-03|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Many firms outside of the big three offer management consulting services to nonprofits, philanthropies, and mission-driven organizations. Some, but not all, are nonprofits themselves.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/special-report/2006/02/25/virtues-intermediaries|title=Virtue's intermediaries|date=2006-02-25|work=The Economist|access-date=2020-01-03|issn=0013-0613}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/wealth-manager/2011/04/13/helping-make-clients-philanthropy-count/|title=Helping Make Clients' Philanthropy Count|last=Dagher|first=Veronica|date=2011-04-13|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>

== Criticism ==

Management consultants are sometimes criticized for the overuse of [[buzzword]]s, reliance on and propagation of [[management fad]]s, and a failure to develop plans that are executable by the client.  As stated above management consulting is an unregulated profession so anyone or any company can style themselves as management consultants.  A number of critical books about management consulting argue that the mismatch between management consulting advice and the ability of executives to actually create the change suggested results in substantial damages to existing businesses. In his book, ''Flawed Advice and the Management Trap'', [[Chris Argyris]] believes that much of the advice given today has real merit. However, a close examination shows that most advice given today contains gaps and inconsistencies that may prevent positive outcomes in the future.<ref>Argyris, Chris. Flawed Advice and the Management Trap. New York: Oxford University Press, USA, 2000. Print.</ref>

[[Ichak Adizes]] and coauthors also criticize timing of consultant services. Client organizations, which is usually lacking knowledge it wants to obtain from the consultant, cannot correctly estimate right timing for engagement of consultants. Consultants are usually engaged too late, when problem is visible at the organizational iceberg tip, so proactive checkup, like regular medical checkup, is recommended.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Adizes|first1=Ichak Kalderon|last2=Rodic|first2=Dusanka|last3=Cudanov|first3=Mladen|date=2017-09-21|title=Estimating consultant engagement in the corporate lifecycle: study of the bias in South Eastern Europe|url=http://management.fon.bg.ac.rs/index.php/mng/article/view/155|journal=Management: Journal of Sustainable Business and Management Solutions in Emerging Economies|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=1–12|doi=10.7595/management.fon.2017.0015|issn=2406-0658|doi-access=free}}</ref> On the other side, this opens additional danger for abuse from disreputable practitioners.

More disreputable consulting firms are sometimes accused of delivering empty promises despite high fees, and also with "stating the obvious" or lacking the experience upon which to base their advice. These consultants bring few innovations, instead offering generic and "prepackaged" strategies and plans that are irrelevant to the client's particular issue. They may fail to prioritize their responsibilities, placing their own firm's interests before those of the clients.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.articleworld.org/index.php/Management_consulting |title=Management Consulting'?|website=ArticleWorld}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2020}}

Further criticisms include: disassembly of the business (by [[layoff|firing]] employees) in a drive to [[cost cutting|cut costs]], only providing analysis reports, junior consultants charging senior rates, reselling similar reports to multiple clients as "custom work", lack of innovation, overbilling for days not worked, speed at the cost of quality, unresponsive large firms and lack of (small) client focus, lack of clarity of [[deliverables]] in contracts, not customizing specific research report criteria and secrecy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-the-management-consultancy-scam-2057127.html|title=Johann Hari: The management consultancy scam|date=20 August 2010|website=independent.co.uk|access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref>

== International standards ==
[[ISO]] published the international standard [[ISO 20700]] ''Guidelines for Management Consultancy Services'' on June 1, 2017.
This document represents the first international standard for the management consultancy industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/63501.html|title=ISO 20700:2017 - Guidelines for management consultancy services|website=www.iso.org|access-date=14 April 2018}}</ref>

An international qualification for a management consulting practitioner is [[Certified Management Consultant]] (CMC).
