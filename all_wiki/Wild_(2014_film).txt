==Plot==
In June 1995, despite a lack of hiking experience, recent divorcée [[Cheryl Strayed]] ([[Reese Witherspoon]]) leaves [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], to hike {{convert|1100|mi}} of the {{convert|2650|mi|adj=on}} [[Pacific Crest Trail]] on a journey of self-discovery and healing. During the hike, Strayed reflects in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] on her childhood in Minnesota and memories of her mother, Bobbi Grey ([[Laura Dern]]). Bobbi's death from cancer sent Cheryl into a deep depression that she tried to numb with [[heroin]] and [[anonymous sex]], which eventually destroyed her marriage to her husband Paul ([[Thomas Sadoski]]). After finding out she was pregnant, Strayed got an [[abortion]] and resolved to hike the trail to redeem herself.

Strayed begins her trek in the [[Mojave Desert]] in [[Southern California]] with her backpack. On the first night, she discovers she has brought the wrong type of gas for her stove and is therefore unable to cook food. After a few more days, Strayed meets Frank ([[W. Earl Brown]]), a farmer and construction worker who takes her in for the night and with his wife offers her a home-cooked meal and a warm shower.

Strayed meets a hiker named Greg ([[Kevin Rankin (actor)|Kevin Rankin]]) who agrees to meet her at [[Kennedy Meadows, California]]. Upon arrival, she meets a camper named Ed ([[Cliff DeYoung]]) who helps Strayed strategically lighten her overweight backpack and convinces her to replace her undersized hiking boots with a new pair, to be delivered to a future stop on the trail. Strayed continues her hike into the [[Sierra Nevada]] despite Greg's warnings of deep snowfall. After removing a boot to remove a loose toenail, the boot accidentally falls down an inaccessibly deep slope, forcing her to continue the journey wearing sandals reinforced with duct tape.

Strayed's best friend Aimee ([[Gaby Hoffmann]]) sends her provisions to stops along the trail, including letters that congratulate her on her progress.  Strayed also receives letters from her ex-husband Paul along the way.

On the morning of Day 58, Strayed is out of water and desperately licks the dew off her tent. Dehydrated and near exhaustion, she [[siphon]]s water from a muddy puddle. While she waits for her water to disinfect, two hunters approach, one making suggestive remarks that leave Strayed feeling threatened and vulnerable. This causes her to quickly leave and run away.

Strayed makes her way out of California and arrives in [[Ashland, Oregon]], where she meets a man named Jonathan ([[Michiel Huisman]]), with whom she attends a tribute concert to [[Jerry Garcia]] and later spends the night. Days later, Strayed arrives at [[Mount Hood National Forest]] and encounters a friendly group of young hikers who share their experiences. The hikers recognize her from the signatures she's been leaving in the hiker's record books along the PCT.  Strayed frequently leaves quotes or poems that are meaningful to her along her journey.

One rainy day, Strayed finds a [[llama]] that escaped from a young boy hiking with his grandmother (Anne Gee Byrd). Strayed chats with the boy, who asks her about her parents. After she mentions her mother's death, the boy sings "[[Red River Valley (song)|Red River Valley]]" to Strayed, saying it is a song his mother used to sing to him. After the boy and his grandmother carry on down the trail, Strayed breaks down and cries.

On September 15, after hiking for 94 days, Strayed reaches the [[Bridge of the Gods (modern structure)|Bridge of the Gods]] on the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington, ending her journey. At various points along the trail, including at the end of the bridge, Strayed encounters a red fox, which she interprets as carrying the spirit of her mother watching over her. She reflects that, four years in the future, she will remarry at a spot in view of the bridge, five years after that have a son and one year after that have a daughter named Bobbi, after Strayed's mother.

<blockquote>By far, this is the hardest movie I've ever made in my life. I didn't hike a thousand miles, of course, but it was a different kind of physical rigor. I'd run up a hill with a 45-pound backpack on, and they'd say, 'Wait, that backpack doesn't look heavy enough. Put this 65-pound backpack on and run up the hill nine or ten times.' We literally didn't stop shooting in those remote locations—we wouldn't break for lunch, we'd just eat snacks. No bathroom breaks. It was crazy, but it was so wonderful. It was complete immersion, and I've never felt closer to a crew. We literally pulled each other up the mountains and carried each others' equipment.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/08/how-wild-saved-a-reese-witherspoon.html |title=How Getting Wild Saved a 'Lost' Reese Witherspoon |last=Buchanan |first=Kyle |date=August 27, 2014 |publisher=[[vulture.com|Vulture]] |access-date=August 29, 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

[[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Witherspoon, who appears in nearly every frame of the film, portrayed Strayed "with grit, wit and unblinking honesty."<ref name=NYTimes20141202/> Scott added that the "most audacious" element of the film was its respect for the "free-associative, memory-driven narrative" in Strayed's written memoir, asserting that the film exhibits a "thrilling disregard" for conventions of commercial cinematic storytelling to demonstrate that images and emotions can carry meaning more effectively than "neatly packaged scenes or carefully scripted character arcs."<ref name="NYTimes20141202">{{Cite news |last=Scott, A.

[[File:Laura Dern Deauville 2017.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Dern received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.]]
Stephen Farber of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised Witherspoon and Dern's performances, as well as Vallée, saying he "has crafted a vivid wilderness adventure film that is also a powerful story of family anguish and survival" and Hornby for adapting "the book with finesse."<ref name="THRFestivalReview">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/wild-telluride-review-729047 |title='Wild': Telluride Review |last=Farber |first=Stephen |date=August 29, 2014 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=August 29, 2014}}</ref>

Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "It's no surprise that the versatile Vallée, who recently directed two [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning performances in ''[[Dallas Buyers Club]]'', has elicited from Witherspoon an intensely committed turn that, in its blend of grit, vulnerability, physical bravery and emotional immediacy, represents easily her most affecting and substantial work in the nine years since ''[[Walk the Line]]''...
