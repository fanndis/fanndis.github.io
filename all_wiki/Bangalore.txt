The city's history dates back to around 890 AD, in a stone inscription found at the [[Nageshvara Temple, Begur|Nageshwara Temple]] in [[Begur, Bangalore]]. The Begur inscription is written in Halegannada (ancient Kannada), mentions 'Bengaluru Kalaga' (battle of Bengaluru). It was a significant turning point in the history of Bangalore as it bears the earliest reference to the name 'Bengaluru'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/1000-year-old-inscription-stone-bears-earliest-reference-to-Bengaluru/articleshow/17446311.cms|title=1000-year old inscription stone bears earliest reference to Bengaluru &#124; Bengaluru News - Times of India|website=The Times of India}}</ref> In 1537&nbsp;CE, [[Kempe Gowda I|Kempé Gowdā]]&nbsp;– a feudal ruler under the [[Vijayanagara Empire]]&nbsp;– established a [[Bengaluru Pete|mud fort]] considered to be the foundation of modern Bengaluru and its oldest areas, or ''petes'', which exist to the present day.
After the fall of Vijayanagar empire in 16th century, the [[Mughals]] sold Bangalore to [[Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar]] (1673–1704), the then ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] for three lakh rupees.<ref name="ekoji">

</ref> When [[Hyder Ali|Haider Ali]] seized control of the Kingdom of Mysore, the administration of Bangalore passed into his hands. It was captured by the [[British East India Company]] after victory in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] (1799), who returned administrative control of the city to the [[Maharaja of Mysore]]. The old city developed in the dominions of the [[Maharaja of Mysore]] and was made capital of the [[Princely State of Mysore]], which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the [[British Raj]]. In 1809, the British shifted their [[Bangalore Cantonment|cantonment]] to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew up around it, which was governed as part of [[British India]]. Following [[independence of India|India's independence]] in 1947, Bangalore became the capital of [[Mysore State]], and remained capital when the new Indian state of [[Karnataka]] was formed in 1956. The two urban settlements of Bangalore&nbsp;– city and cantonment&nbsp;– which had developed as independent entities merged into a single urban centre in 1949. The existing [[Kannada]] name, ''Bengalūru'', was declared the [[official name]] of the city in 2006.

Bangalore is widely regarded as the "[[Silicon Valley]] of India" (or "IT capital of India") because of its role as the nation's leading [[information technology]] (IT) exporter.<ref name="cnn-Dec2012">

== Etymology ==

The name "Bangalore" represents an [[anglicised]] version of the [[Kannada language]] name and its original name, "Bengalūru" [[ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು]] {{IPA-kn|ˈbeŋɡəɭuːru || Bengaluru-Kannada-Pronunciation.ogg}}. It is the name of a village near Kodigehalli in Bangalore city today and was used by Kempegowda to christen the city as Bangalore at the time of its foundation. The earliest reference to the name "Bengalūru" was found in a ninth-century [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] stone inscription on a "''vīra gallu''{{-"}} ({{lang|kn|ವೀರಗಲ್ಲು}}) (literally, "[[hero stone]]", a rock edict extolling the virtues of a warrior). In this inscription found in [[Begur, Bangalore|Begur]], "Bengalūrū" is referred to as a place in which a battle was fought in 890&nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]]. It states that the place was part of the [[Western Ganga Dynasty|Ganga Kingdom]] until 1004 and was known as "''Bengaval-uru''", the "City of Guards" in [[Halegannada]] (Old Kannada).<ref name="OtherNames">

An [[apocryphal]] story recounts that the twelfth century [[Hoysala]] king [[Veera Ballala II]], while on a hunting expedition, lost his way in the forest. Tired and hungry, he came across a poor old woman who served him boiled beans. The grateful king named the place "benda-kaal-uru" (literally, "town of boiled beans"), which eventually evolved into "Bengalūru".<ref name="OtherNames" /><ref name="Bendakaaluru">{{cite web

Modern Bangalore was begun in 1537&nbsp;by a [[vassal]] of the Vijayanagara Empire, [[Kempe Gowda I]], who aligned with the Vijayanagara empire to campaign against Gangaraja (whom he defeated and expelled to Kanchi), and who built [[Bengaluru Pete|a mud-brick fort]] for the people at the site that would become the central part of modern Bangalore. Kempe Gowda was restricted by rules made by Achuta Deva Raya, who feared the potential power of Kempe Gowda and did not allow a formidable stone fort. Kempe Gowda referred to the new town as his "gandubhūmi" or "Land of Heroes".<ref name="gandubhoomi">{{cite news

Kempe Gowda I's successor, Kempe Gowda II, built four towers that marked Bangalore's boundary. During the Vijayanagara rule, many saints and poets referred to Bangalore as "Devarāyanagara" and "Kalyānapura" or "Kalyānapuri" ("Auspicious City").<ref name="bglrHist2">{{Cite thesis

After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565&nbsp;in the [[Battle of Talikota]], Bangalore's rule changed hands several times. Kempe Gowda declared independence, then in 1638, a large [[Adil Shahi]] Bijapur army led by Ranadulla Khan and accompanied by his second in command [[Shahaji|Shāhji Bhōnslé]] defeated Kempe Gowda III,<ref name="bglrHist2" /> and Bangalore was given to Shāhji as a ''[[jagir]]'' (feudal estate). In 1687, the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] general Kasim Khan, under orders from [[Aurangzeb]], defeated [[Ekoji I]], son of Shāhji, and sold Bangalore to [[Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar]] (1673–1704), the then ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] for three lakh rupees.<ref name="ekoji" /> After the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II in 1759, [[Hyder Ali]], Commander-in-Chief of the Mysore Army, proclaimed himself the ''de facto'' ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore. Hyder Ali is credited with building the Delhi and Mysore gates at the northern and southern ends of the city in 1760.<ref name="tt6">{{harvnb|Pinto|Srivastava|2008|p=6|Ref=TalkoftheTown}}</ref> The kingdom later passed to Hyder Ali's son [[Tipu Sultan]]. Hyder and Tipu contributed towards the beautification of the city by building [[Lal Bagh]] Botanical Gardens in 1760. Under them, Bangalore developed into a commercial and military centre of strategic importance.<ref name="bglrHist2" />

The Bangalore fort was captured by the British armies under [[Lord Cornwallis]] on 21&nbsp;March&nbsp;1791 during the [[Third Anglo-Mysore War]] and formed a centre for British resistance against Tipu Sultan.<ref name="Mil_Engr_In_India_Vol_1">{{cite book

Other information technology companies followed suit and by the end of the 20th&nbsp;century, Bangalore had established itself as the ''[[Silicon Valley]] of India''.<ref name="bglrHist2" /> Today, Bangalore is India's third most populous city.

In the 16th century, Kempe Gowda I constructed many lakes to meet the town's water requirements. The Kempambudhi Kere, since overrun by modern development, was prominent among those lakes.

Bangalore has a handful of freshwater lakes and [[water tank]]s, the largest of which are Madivala tank, [[Hebbal]] lake, [[Ulsoor]] lake, Yediyur Lake and [[Sankey Tank]]. Groundwater occurs in [[silt]]y to [[sand]]y layers of the [[alluvial]] sediments.

Bangalore's rapid growth has created several problems relating to traffic congestion and infrastructural obsolescence that the Bangalore Mahanagara Palike has found challenging to address. The unplanned nature of growth in the city resulted in massive traffic [[gridlock]]s that the municipality attempted to ease by constructing a [[flyover (overpass)|flyover]] system and by imposing one-way traffic systems. Some of the flyovers and one-ways mitigated the traffic situation moderately but were unable to adequately address the disproportionate growth of city traffic.<ref name="urban">

[[Kannada literature]] appears to have flourished in Bangalore even before Kempe Gowda laid the foundations of the city. During the 18th&nbsp;and&nbsp;19th&nbsp;centuries, Kannada literature was enriched by the ''[[Vachanas]]'' (a form of rhythmic writing) composed by the heads of the [[Veerashaiva]] [[Matha]]s (monastery) in Bangalore. As a cosmopolitan city, Bangalore has also encouraged the growth of Telugu, Urdu, and English literatures. The headquarters of the [[Kannada Sahitya Parishat]], a nonprofit organisation that promotes the Kannada language, is located in Bangalore.<ref>
