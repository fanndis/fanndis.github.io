'''Snapchat''' is an American [[multimedia]] [[messaging app]] developed by [[Snap Inc.]], originally Snapchat Inc. One of the principal features of Snapchat is that pictures and messages are usually only available for a short time before they become inaccessible to their recipients. The app has evolved from originally focusing on person-to-person photo sharing to presently featuring users' "Stories" of 24 hours of chronological content, along with "Discover," letting brands show ad-supported short-form content. It also allows users to keep photos in the "my eyes only" which lets them keep their photos in a password-protected space. It has also reportedly incorporated limited use of end-to-end encryption, with plans to broaden its use in the future.

Snapchat was created by [[Evan Spiegel]], [[Bobby Murphy (businessman)|Bobby Murphy]], and Reggie Brown,<ref name="settlement"/> former students at [[Stanford University]]. It has become known for representing a new, mobile-first direction for [[social media]], and places significant emphasis on users interacting with virtual stickers and [[augmented reality]] objects. As of March 2020, Snapchat had 229 million daily active users.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://investor.snap.com/news-releases/2020/04-21-2020-210949737|title=Snap Inc.

== History ==
{{For timeline|Timeline of Snapchat}}

=== Prototype ===
According to documents and [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] statements, Reggie Brown brought the idea for a disappearing pictures application to [[Evan Spiegel]] because Spiegel had prior business experience. Brown and Spiegel then pulled in [[Bobby Murphy (businessman)|Bobby Murphy]], who had experience [[Computer program|coding]]. The three worked closely together for several months and launched Snapchat as "Picaboo" on the [[iOS]] operating system on July 8, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Edwards |title=The alleged betrayal described in these photos, texts, and emails cost Snapchat $158 million |url=http://nordic.businessinsider.com/snapchat-founders-lawsuit-internal-photos-texts-emails-2017-2 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=February 3, 2017 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Billy |last=Gallagher |title=Snapchat's Spiegel Admits Brown "Came Up With The Idea For Disappearing Picture Messages" In New Court Documents |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/new-snapchat-docs/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 1, 2013 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref> Reggie Brown was ousted from the company months after it was launched.<ref>{{Cite news| author = Masunaga, Samantha | date = March 1, 2017 | title = What Happened to Ousted Snapchat Founder Reggie Brown?

The app was relaunched as Snapchat in September 2011, and the team focused on usability and technical aspects, rather than branding efforts.<ref name="Forbes, touch" /> One exception was the decision to keep a mascot designed by Brown, "Ghostface Chillah," named after [[Ghostface Killah]] of the hip-hop group [[Wu-Tang Clan]].<ref name="Forbes, touch" />

On May 8, 2012, Reggie Brown sent an email to Evan Spiegel during their senior year at Stanford, in which he offered to re-negotiate his equitable share regarding ownership of the company. Lawyers for Snapchat responded by insisting that he had never had any creative connection to the product. The attorneys also accused Brown of committing [[fraud]] against Spiegel and Murphy by falsely claiming to be a product inventor. On behalf of their clients, the law firm concluded that [[Snap Inc.#Controversy|Reggie Brown]] had made no contributions of value or worth, and was therefore entitled to a share of nothing.<ref>Original document, [http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/725391-151160912-snapchat-reggie-brown-declaration.html "151160912 Snapchat Reggie Brown Declaration"], ''Sam Biddle Documentcloud'', July 10, 2013.

In their first [[blog]] post, dated May 9, 2012, [[CEO]] Evan Spiegel described the company's mission: "Snapchat isn’t about capturing the traditional [[Kodak]] moment. It’s about communicating with the full range of human emotion — not just what appears to be pretty or perfect."<ref name="let's chat">{{cite web |first=Evan |last=Spiegel |authorlink=Evan Spiegel |title=Let's chat. |url=https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/lets-chat/ |website=Snap News |publisher=[[Snap Inc.]] |date=May 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref> He presented Snapchat as the solution to stresses caused by the longevity of personal information on social media, evidenced by "emergency detagging of [[Facebook]] photos before job interviews and [[photo manipulation|photoshopping]] blemishes out of candid shots before they hit the internet.<ref name="let's chat"/>

In November 2020, Snapchat announced it would pay a total of $1 million a day to users who post viral videos.

Snapchat is primarily used for creating multimedia messages referred to as "snaps"; snaps can consist of a photo or a short video, and can be edited to include filters and effects, text captions, and drawings.<ref name="pocketlint-7tips">{{cite web|title=7 Snapchat tips and tricks you probably had no clue about|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/132491-7-snapchat-tips-and-tricks-you-probably-had-no-clue-about|website=Pocket-lint|accessdate=December 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Snapchat Hands-on: Send Photos Set to Self-Destruct|url=http://blog.laptopmag.com/hands-on-with-snapchat-send-photos-set-to-self-destruct|work=Laptop|publisher=TechMedia Network|accessdate=September 15, 2013|author=Alba, Davey |date=May 16, 2012}}</ref> Snaps can be directed privately to selected contacts, or to a semi-public "Story" or a public "Story" called "Our Story."<ref name="tc-stories"/> The ability to send video snaps was added as a feature option in December 2012.

Private message photo snaps can be viewed for a user-specified length of time (1 to 10 seconds as determined by the sender) before they become inaccessible.

In November 2014, Snapchat introduced "Snapcash," a feature that lets users send and receive money to each other through private messaging. The payments system is powered by [[Square, Inc.|Square]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Kurt |last=Wagner |title=Snapchat to Let You Send Money to Friends, Thanks to Square |url=https://www.recode.net/2014/11/17/11632930/snapchat-to-let-you-send-money-to-friends-thanks-to-square |website=[[Recode]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 17, 2014 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Snapchat Now Lets You Send Money To Friends Through Snapcash Deal With Square Cash |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/17/snapcash/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=November 17, 2014 |accessdate=April 27, 2017}}</ref>

In July 2016, Snapchat introduced a new, optional feature known as "Memories." Memories allow snaps and story posts to be saved into a private storage area, where they can be viewed alongside other photos stored on the device, as well as edited and published as snaps, story posts, or messages. When shared with a user's current story, the memory would have a white frame and timestamp to indicate its age. Content in the Memories storage area can be searched by date or using a local [[object recognition]] system. Snaps accessible within Memories can additionally be placed into a "My Eyes Only" area that is locked with a [[Personal identification number]] (PIN). Snapchat has stated that the Memories feature was inspired by the practice of manually scrolling through photos on a phone to show them to others.<ref>{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Snapchat introduces Memories: a searchable, shareable archive of your snaps |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/6/12102294/snapchat-memories-private-snap-archive |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=July 6, 2016 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref> In April 2017, the white border around old memories was removed.

In July 2017, Snapchat started allowing users to add links to snaps, enabling them to direct viewers to specific websites; the feature was only available for brands previously. Additionally, the update added more creative tools: A "Backdrop" feature lets users cut out a specific object from their photo and apply colorful patterns to it in order to bring greater emphasis to that object, and "Voice Filters" enable users to remix the sounds of their voices in the snap. Voice Filters was previously available as part of the feature enabling augmented reality lenses, with the new update adding a dedicated speaker icon to remix the audio in any snap.<ref>{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Snapchat lets you add links, voice filters and backdrops to Snaps |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/snapchat-links-backdrops-voice-filters/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 5, 2017 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Shannon |last=Liao |title=Snapchat's latest update lets you send links to friends |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15923834/snapchat-link-sending-update-paperclip-voice-filters-backdrops |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=July 5, 2017 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}</ref>

==== Filters, lenses, and stickers ====
Snaps can be personalized with various forms of visual effects and [[Sticker (messaging)|stickers]].  Geofilters are graphical overlays available if the user is [[Geo-fence|within a certain geographical location]], such as a city, event, or destination. Users can design and create their own geofilters for personal events at a fee of $10–15 USD per hour.

Snapchat also launched integration with Twitch, including an in-stream [[Software widget|widget]] for Snapcodes, the ability to offer lenses to stream viewers and as an incentive to channel subscribers. Several video game-themed lenses were also launched at this time, including ones themed around ''[[League of Legends]]'', ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', and ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/26/twitch-snap-camera-snapchat-augmented-reality-filters/|title=Twitch streamers are getting Snap's AR selfie filters|work=Engadget|access-date=November 6, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/18026688/snap-camera-snapchat-lenses-twitch-youtube-skype|title=Snapchat brings its camera to the desktop to add filters to your streaming videos|work=The Verge|access-date=November 6, 2018}}</ref>

In August 2020, Snapchat collaborated with 4 TikTok influencers to launch Augmented Reality (AR) lenses to create a more interactive experience with users. The lenses now incorporate geo-locational mapping techniques to incorporate digital overlays onto real world surfaces. These lenses track 18 joints across the body to identify body movements, and generate effects around the body of the user.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Carman|first=Ashley|date=2020-08-13|title=Snapchat now has lenses specifically to be used in viral TikTok dance challenges|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21365330/snapchat-augmented-reality-lens-tiktok-dance-dixie-damelio|access-date=2020-09-01|website=The Verge|language=en}}</ref> [[Advertising]] is now also utilizing AR lenses that make users a part of the advert. Coca Cola, Pepsi and Taco Bell are just a select few of the brands now utilizing the tech on Snapchat.

==== Friend emojis ====
Friend emojis can be customisable, however there are default emojis [see list below]. Snapscore, which states the amount of snaps you've sent and received is recorded and is visible to your friends. If you tap your own score it shows the ratio of sent and received snaps, the amount of snaps you have sent is on the right and the amount of snaps you have received is on the left, these numbers combined are your Snapchat score. There are multiple synonyms for Snapchat score such as Snapchat points, Snapscore, Snap points and Snap Number.<ref>{{Cite web|title=This is how you increase Snap score {{!}} What is Snapchat score?|url=https://snapchatscore.net/content/11-how-to-increase-snap-score-and-what-is-snapchat-score|access-date=2020-10-06|website=snapchatscore.net}}</ref>

In June 2014, the story feature was expanded to incorporate "Our Stories," which was then changed to "Live Stories" about a year later. The feature allows users on-location at specific events (such as [[music festival]]s or sporting events) to contribute snaps to a curated story advertised to all users, showcasing a single event from multiple perspectives and viewpoints. These curated snaps provided by the app's contributors and selected for the "Live" section could also be more localized, but Snapchat eventually scaled back the more personal imaging streams in order to emphasize public events.<ref>{{cite web |first=Carl |last=Franzen |title=Snapchat lets you watch and create group videos of live events with 'Our Story' |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/29/6084221/snapchat-our-story-collective-snaps-from-live-events |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=August 29, 2014 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.snapchat.com/post/89064817345/introducing-our-story|title=Snapchat – Introducing Our Story|work=Snapchat Blog|accessdate=May 16, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522175232/http://blog.snapchat.com/post/89064817345/introducing-our-story|archivedate=May 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/snapchat-new-years-times-square/|title=Your Snapchat photo could wind up in Times Square tonight|work=The Daily Dot|accessdate=May 16, 2015}}</ref><ref name="recode-storiesmoney">{{cite web |first=Kurt |last=Wagner |title=Snapchat Is Making Some Pretty Serious Money From Live Stories |url=https://www.recode.net/2015/6/17/11563634/snapchats-making-some-pretty-serious-money-from-live-stories |website=[[Recode]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 17, 2015 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=P.

In May 2017, Snapchat introduced "Custom Stories," letting users collaboratively make stories combining their captures.<ref>{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Snapchat introduces custom stories for capturing group moments with friends |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/23/15677712/snapchat-custom-stories-launch |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 23, 2017 |accessdate=May 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Darrell |last=Etherington |title=Snapchat now lets you create custom stories for groups of friends and family |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/23/snapchat-now-lets-you-create-custom-stories-for-groups-of-friends-and-family/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=May 23, 2017 |accessdate=May 23, 2017}}</ref>

In June 2017, "Snap Map" was introduced, which allows users to optionally share their location with friends. A map display, accessible from the viewfinder, can be used to locate stories based on location data, supporting the use of Bitmoji as place markers. Entering a "Ghost Mode" hides the user from the map.<ref>{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Snapchat launches location-sharing feature Snap Map |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/snap-map/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 21, 2017 |accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Snapchat's new Snap Map lets you share your location with friends |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/21/15846358/snapchat-snap-map-location-sharing-feature-announced |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 21, 2017 |accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref> The function is based on the app Zenly, which was acquired by Snap Inc. prior to its launch.<ref>{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Snapchat acquires social map app Zenly for $250M to $350M |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/snapchat-buys-zenly/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 21, 2017 |accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref> The map data is supplied from [[OpenStreetMap]] and [[Mapbox]], while satellite imagery comes from [[DigitalGlobe]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://streetfightmag.com/2017/07/10/snapchat-expands-its-foray-into-local-with-snap-map/ |title=Snapchat Expands Its Foray Into Local with Snap Map |author=Rollison, Damian |work=Street Fight |date=July 10, 2017 |accessdate=September 22, 2017}}</ref>

==== Original video content ====
''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported in May 2017 that [[Snap Inc.]], the company developing Snapchat, had signed deals with [[NBCUniversal]], [[A&E Networks]], [[BBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[Metro–Goldwyn–Mayer]] and other content producers to develop original shows for viewing through Snapchat's "Stories" format. According to the report, Snap hoped to have several new shows available on a daily basis, with each show lasting between three and five minutes, and the company has sent out detailed reports to its partners on how to produce content for Snapchat. Over 2017 and 2018, Snap and partners launched several shows.<ref>{{cite web |first=Shalini |last=Ramachandran |title=Media Companies Line Up to Make Shows for Snap TV |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/media-companies-line-up-to-make-shows-for-snap-tv-1493890205 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]  |date=May 4, 2017 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Fingas |title=Snap signs major network deals for Snapchat TV shows |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/05/04/snap-signs-major-network-deals-for-snapchat-tv-shows |website=AppleInsider |date=May 4, 2017 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Mitchel |last=Broussard |title=Snapchat Plans Original TV Shows Lasting 3-5 Minutes Each, Partners Include ABC, HGTV, and More |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/04/snapchat-original-tv-shows/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=May 4, 2017 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}</ref>

=== Messaging ===
[[File:Snap on smartphone.jpg|thumb|right|Example Snapchat "snap" on a smartphone.]]
In contrast to other messaging apps, Spiegel described Snapchat's messaging functions as being "conversational," rather than "transactional," as they sought to replicate the conversations he engaged in with friends. Spiegel stated that he did not experience conversational interactions while using the products of competitors like [[iMessage]].<ref name="verge-snapchatchat" />

Rather than a traditional online notification, a blue pulsing "here" button is displayed within the sender's chat window if the recipient is currently viewing their own chat window. When this button is held down, a video chat function is immediately launched.<ref name="verge-snapchatchat" /> By default, messages disappear after they are read, and a notification is sent to the recipient only when they start to type.<ref name="verge-snapchatchat" /> Users can also use messages to reply to snaps that are part of a story.<ref>{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Snapchat introduces a 'lens store' to adorn your selfies with 99-cent filters |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/13/9700312/snapchat-lens-store |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 13, 2015 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref> The video chat feature uses technology from AddLive—a real-time communications provider that Snapchat acquired prior to the feature's launch.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ellis |last=Hamburger |title=Snapchat made a secret acquisition to power its new video chat |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/2/5676196/snapchat-acquires-addlive-video-chat |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref> In regards to the "Here" indicator, Spiegel explained that "the accepted notion of an online indicator that every chat service has is really a negative indicator. It means 'my friend is available and doesn't want to talk to you,' versus this idea in Snapchat where 'my friend is here and is giving you their full attention.'" Spiegel further claimed that the Here video function prevents the awkwardness that can arise from apps that use typing indicators because, with text communication, conversations lose their fluidity as each user tries to avoid typing at the same time.<ref name="verge-snapchatchat">{{cite web |first=Ellis |last=Hamburger |title=Real talk: the new Snapchat brilliantly mixes video and texting |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/1/5670260/real-talk-the-new-snapchat-makes-texting-fun-again-video-calls |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 1, 2014 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref>

On March 29, 2016, Snapchat launched a major revision of the messaging functionality known as "Chat 2.0," adding stickers, easier access to audio and video conferencing, the ability to leave audio or video "notes," and the ability to share recent camera photos. The implementation of these features are meant to allow users to easily shift between text, audio, and video chat as needed while retaining an equal level of functionality.<ref>{{cite web |first=Casey |last=Newton |title=Snapchat redesigns chat to add stickers, audio, and video notes |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/29/11321150/snapchat-chat-redesign-stickers-audio-video-notes |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=March 29, 2016 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref> In June 2018, Snapchat added the feature of deleting a sent message (including; audio, video, and text) before it is read.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17449906/snapchat-delete-unopened-sent-messages-spectacles-amazon|title=Snapchat now lets you delete unopened sent messages|work=The Verge|access-date=June 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://9to5mac.com/2018/06/11/snapchat-delete-sent-messages-spectacles-amazon/|title=Snapchat update lets you delete sent messages, Spectacles hit Amazon․com|date=June 11, 2018|work=9to5Mac|access-date=June 12, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> A feature introduced in August 2018 allows users to send Musical GIFs, TuneMojis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-musical-gifs-tunemoji-2018-8|title=You can now send musical GIFs to Snapchat|work=Business Insider|access-date=August 27, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/snapchat-tunemoji-music-gifs-a3918361.html|title=You can now send music GIFs in Snapchat with TuneMoji|work=Evening Standard|access-date=August 27, 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

=== Encryption ===
In January 2018, SnapChat introduced the use of end-to-end encryption in the application but only for snaps (pictures and video), according to a Snapchat security engineer presenting at the January 2019 Real World Crypto Conference.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/01/09/snapchat-adds-end-to-end-encryption-protect-users-messages/|title=Snapchat adds end-to-end encryption to protect users' messages |website=The Telegraph |date=January 10, 2019 |access-date=June 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://rwc.iacr.org/2019/slides/snap.pdf |title=Catch Me if You Can: An Account Based End-to-end Encryption for 1/1 Snaps |website=International Association for Cryptologic Research |date=January 2019 |access-date=June 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xePC0Tyeuc&feature=youtu.be&t=5484 |title=Real World Crypto 2019 - Day 1 - Session 1 - Morning - part 1 |website=YouTube |date=January 9, 2019 |access-date=June 4, 2020}}</ref> As of the January 2019 conference SnapChat had plans to introduce end-to-end encryption for text messages and group chats in the future.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalinformationworld.com/2019/01/snapchat-end-to-end-encryption-users-media-messages.html|title=Finally: Snapchat comes up with end-to-end encryption to secure users conversations and data |website=Digital Information World |date=January 11, 2019 |access-date=June 4, 2020}}</ref>

== Business and multimedia ==
===Demographics===
From its earliest days, Snapchat's main demographic has consisted of the [[Generation Z]] age group. On the app store, the age classification is 12+.<ref name="digiday-demographics">{{cite web|url=http://digiday.com/platforms/snapchat-pitching-brands-agencies/|title=Pitch deck: How Snapchat is selling itself to marketers – Digiday|work=[[Digiday]]|accessdate=May 16, 2015}}</ref> In 2014, researchers from the [[University of Washington]] and [[Seattle Pacific University]] designed a user survey to help understand how and why the application was being used. The researchers originally hypothesized that due to the ephemeral nature of Snapchat messages, its use would be predominantly for privacy-sensitive content including the much talked about potential use for sexual content and [[sexting]].<ref name="Roesner">{{cite journal|last1=Roesner| first1=Franziska|first2=Brian T|last2=Gill|first3=Tadayoshi|last3=Kohno |title=Sex, Lies, or Kittens? Investigating the Use of Snapchat's Self-Destructing Messages|journal=Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference| series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|date=2014| volume=8437| pages=64–76|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-45472-5_5| isbn=978-3-662-45471-8|url=https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yoshi/papers/snapchat-FC2014.pdf}}</ref> However, it appears that Snapchat is used for a variety of creative purposes that are not necessarily privacy-related at all.<ref name="Roesner" /> In the study, only 1.6% of respondents reported using Snapchat primarily for sexting, although 14.2% admitted to having sent sexual content via Snapchat at some point.<ref name="Roesner" /> These findings suggest that users do not seem to utilize Snapchat for sensitive content. Rather, the primary use for Snapchat was found to be for comedic content such as "stupid faces" with 59.8% of respondents reporting this use most commonly.<ref name="Roesner" /> The researchers also determined how Snapchat users do not use the application and what types of content they are not willing to send. They found that the majority of users are not willing to send content classified as sexting (74.8% of respondents), photos of documents (85.0% of respondents), messages containing legally questionable content (86.6% of respondents), or content considered mean or insulting (93.7% of respondents).<ref name="Roesner" />

The study results also suggested that Snapchat's success is not due to its security properties, but because the users found the application to be fun. The researchers found that users seem to be well-aware (79.4% of respondents) that recovering snaps is possible and a majority of users (52.8% of respondents) report that this does not affect their behavior and use of Snapchat.<ref name="Roesner" /> Many users (52.8% of respondents) were found to use an arbitrary timeout length on snaps regardless of the content type or recipient. The remaining respondents were found to adjust their snaps' timeout depending on the content or the recipient.<ref name="Roesner" /> Reasons for adjusting the time length of snaps included the level of trust and relationship with the recipient, the time needed to comprehend the snap, and avoiding [[screenshot]]s.<ref name="Roesner" />

===Communication===
Snapchat has often been seen to represent a new direction in social media, with its users craving a more in-the-moment way of sharing and communicating via technology. With less emphasis on the accumulation of an ongoing status involving the presence of permanent material, Snapchat put the focus on the ephemeral nature of fleeting encounters.<ref>Casey Johnston, [http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/snapchat-instagram-stories-and-the-internet-of-forgetting "Snachat, Instagram Stories, And The Internet Of Forgetting"], ''TheNewYorker'', August 5, 2016. Retrieved August 6, 2016.</ref>
Building on this distinction by launching as a mobile-first company, Snapchat, in the midst of the app revolution and the growing presence of cellular communication, didn't have to make the transition to mobile in the way other competing social media networks had to do. Evan Spiegel himself described Snapchat as primarily a camera company.<ref>Ben Basche, [https://medium.freecodecamp.com/ghost-in-the-machine-snapchat-isnt-mobile-first-it-s-something-else-entirely-4f6c265152a2#.sqvrq1k2w "Ghost in the machine: Snapchat isn’t mobile-first — it’s something else entirely"], ''ibtimes.com'', July 28, 2016.

Retrieved August 6, 2016.</ref> Nevertheless, the growing mobile app moved to offer distinct publication, media, and news content within its Discover channel, as well as with its overall style of presentation. With Snapchat, a clear and identifiable line was drawn between brand content and user-based messaging and sharing, once again distinguishing the popular app from other social media networks, which typically have blended and blurred their different varieties of content.<ref>Matthew Hussey, [https://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/05/04/story-snapchats-confusing-discover-feed/ "Snapchat’s Discover channel is quietly ruining the social network"], ''thenextweb.com'', May 8, 2016.

===Monetization===
Snapchat's developing features embody a deliberate strategy of [[monetization]].

Snapchat announced its then-upcoming advertising efforts on October 17, 2014, when it acknowledged its need for a revenue stream.<ref>{{cite web |first=Garett |last=Sloane |title=Snapchat Says Ads Are Coming This Weekend: 'We Need the Money' |url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/snapchat-says-ads-are-coming-weekend-we-need-money-160857/ |website=[[Adweek]] |publisher=Beringer Capital |date=October 17, 2014 |accessdate=June 20, 2017}}</ref> The company stated that it wanted to evaluate "if we can deliver an experience that's fun and informative, the way ads used to be, before they got creepy and targeted."<ref>{{cite web |first=Stuart |last=Dredge |title=Snapchat messaging app gets its first ad... and it's very creepy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/20/snapchat-messaging-app-ad-creepy-ouija |website=[[The Guardian]]  |date=October 20, 2014 |accessdate=June 20, 2017}}</ref> Snapchat's first paid advertisement, in the form of a 20-second movie trailer for the horror film ''[[Ouija (2014 film)|Ouija]]'', was shown to users on October 19, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |first=Karissa |last=Bell |title=Snapchat Freaks Out Users With First Ad for 'Ouija' |url=http://mashable.com/2014/10/18/snapchat-ouija-ad/ |website=[[Mashable]] |date=October 19, 2014 |accessdate=June 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Marc |last=Graser |title=Snapchat Scares Up Advertising Business with 'Ouija' |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/snapchat-scares-up-advertising-business-with-ouija-1201334130/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |date=October 19, 2014 |accessdate=June 20, 2017}}</ref>

In January 2015, Snapchat began making a shift from focusing on growth to monetization. The company launched its "Discover" feature, which allowed for paid advertising by presenting short-form content from publishers. Its initial launch partners included CNN, Comedy Central, ESPN and Food Network, among others.<ref name="Chowdhry 2015"/><ref name="Los Angeles Times"/><ref>{{cite web |first=Alyson |last=Shontell |title=Advertisers are supposedly paying insanely high rates to get their ads on Snapchat |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/snapchat-discover-ad-rates-2015-3 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=March 12, 2015 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref> In June 2015, Snapchat announced that it would allow advertisers to purchase sponsored geofilters for snaps; an early customer of the offering was [[McDonald's]], who paid for a branded geofilter covering its restaurant locations in the United States.<ref name="tc-sponsoredfilters">{{cite web |first=Fitz |last=Tepper |title=Snapchat Turns Geofilters Into An Ad Unit |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/16/snapchat-begins-charging-for-sponsored-geofilters/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 16, 2015 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref> Snapchat made a push to earn ad revenue from its "Live Stories" feature in 2015, after initially launching the feature in 2014. Ad placements can be sold within a live story, or a story can be pitched by a sponsor. Live stories are estimated to reach an average of 20 million viewers in a 24-hour span.<ref name="recode-storiesmoney" />

=== Campaigns ===
In September 2015, the service entered into a partnership with the [[National Football League]] to present live stories from selected games (including a Sunday game, and marquee games such as [[Monday Night Football]] and [[Thursday Night Football]]), with both parties contributing content and handling ad sales.<ref name="recode-storiesmoney" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2015/9/17/11618660/snapchat-inks-nfl-deal-to-bring-football-into-its-live-stories|title=Snapchat Inks NFL Deal to Bring Football Into Its Live Stories|last=Wagner|first=Kurt|date=September 17, 2015|website=[[Recode]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref> The 2015 Internet Trends Report by Mary Meeker highlighted the significant growth of [[vertical video]] viewing.

In April 2016, [[NBC Olympics]] announced that it had reached a deal with Snapchat to allow stories from the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] to be featured on Snapchat in the United States. The content would include a behind-the-scenes Discover channel curated by [[BuzzFeed]] (a company which [[NBCUniversal]] has funded), and stories featuring a combination of footage from NBC, athletes, and attendees. NBC sold advertising and entered into revenue sharing agreements. This marked the first time NBC allowed Olympics footage to be featured on third-party property.<ref name="bloomberg-nbcriosc">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-29/snapchat-scores-unprecedented-deal-with-nbc-to-showcase-olympics|title=Snapchat Scores Unique Deal With NBC to Showcase Olympics|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=April 30, 2016}}</ref> In May 2016, as part of a campaign to promote ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', [[20th Century Fox]] paid for the entire array of lenses to be replaced by those based on characters from the ''[[X-Men]]'' series and films for a single day.<ref>{{cite web |first=Lauren |last=Johnson |title=20th Century Fox Buys First Snapchat Lens Takeover Ad |url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/twentieth-century-fox-buys-first-snapchat-lens-takeover-ad-171639/ |website=[[Adweek]] |publisher=Beringer Capital |date=May 23, 2016 |accessdate=June 20, 2017}}</ref> In July 2016, it was reported that Snapchat had submitted a [[patent]] application for the process of using an object recognition system to deliver sponsored filters based on objects seen in a camera view.<ref>{{cite web |first=James |last=Vincent |title=Snapchat applies for patent to serve ads by recognizing objects in your snaps |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/18/12211292/snapchat-object-recognition-advertising |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=July 18, 2016 |accessdate=April 10, 2017}}</ref> Later that year, in September 2016, Snapchat released its first hardware product, called the Spectacles.

=== Development platform ===

In June 2018, Snapchat announced a new third-party development platform known as Snap Kit: a suite of components that allows partners to provide third-party integrations with aspects of the service. "Login Kit" is a [[social login]] platform that utilizes Snapchat accounts. It was promoted as being more privacy-conscious than competing equivalents, as services are only able to receive the user's display name (and, optionally, a Bitmoji avatar) and are subject to a 90-day inactivity timeout, preventing them from being able to collect any further personal information or [[social graph]]s through their authorization. "Creative Kit" allows apps to generate their own stickers to overlay into Snapchat posts. "Story Kit" can be used to embed and aggregate publicly posted stories (with for example, [[Bandsintown]] using Story Kit to aggregate stories posted by musicians), while "Bitmoji Kit" allows Bitmoji stickers to be integrated into third-party apps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2018/06/14/snapchat-snap-kit/|title=Snapchat launches privacy-safe Snap Kit, the un-Facebook platform|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref>

===Snap Originals===
In a response to industry competition, Snapchat diversified their content by launching Snap Originals, which is episodic content. The series include both scripted content and documentaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/10/snapchat-originals/|title=Snapchat becomes the mobile HBO with 12 daily scripted Original shows/|last=Constine, Josh|date=October 10, 2018|website=TechCrunch|language=en-US|access-date=February 29, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXAXGSK8xJrwLJg7b3VO_RQ/featured|title=Snap Originals channel|website=Youtube|language=en-US|access-date=February 29, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://snaporiginals.snapchat.com|website=SnapChat|language=en-US|access-date=February 29, 2020}}</ref>

In June 2020, Snapchat announced the creation of its first-ever “shoppable” original show: “The Drop,” focused on “exclusive streetwear collabs” from celebrities and designers. Each episode of “The Drop” will explore the relationship between the designer and celebrity collaborator. Viewers will learn about the item for sale and how it came together as well as what time that day the item will go up for sale. Later that day, at the aforementioned time, the episode will be updated with more content that includes a “swipe up to buy” call to action.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=2020-06-23|title=Snapchat Announces First Shoppable Show, 'The Drop,' to Sell Limited-Edition Streetwear|url=https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/snapchat-the-drop-shoppable-show-peter-naylor-newfronts-1234644788/|access-date=2020-06-24|website=Variety|language=en}}</ref>

=== Federal Trade Commission ===
In 2014, Snapchat settled a complaint made by the [[Federal Trade Commission|Federal Trade Commission (FTC)]]. The government agency alleged that the company had exaggerated to the public the degree to which mobile app images and photos could actually be made to disappear. Under the terms of the agreement, Snapchat was not fined, but the app service agreed to have its claims and policies monitored by an independent party for a period of 20 years. The FTC concluded that Snapchat was prohibited from "misrepresenting the extent to which it maintains the privacy, security, or confidentiality of users' information."<ref>Andrea Peterson, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/05/08/snapchat-agrees-to-settle-ftc-charges-that-it-deceived-users/ "Snapchat agrees to settle FTC charges that it deceived users"], ''The Washington Post'', May 8, 2014. Retrieved August 16, 2016.</ref>

Following the agreement, Snapchat updated its privacy page to state that the company "can't guarantee that messages will be deleted within a specific timeframe." <ref name="snapchatprivacy">{{cite web|title=Snapchat Privacy Policy|url=http://www.snapchat.com/privacy|accessdate=February 22, 2015}}</ref> Even after Snapchat deletes message data from their servers, that same data may remain in backup for a certain period of time.<ref name="snapchatprivacy" /> In a public blog post, the service warned that "If you've ever tried to recover lost data after accidentally deleting a drive or maybe watched an episode of ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'', you might know that with the right forensic tools, it's sometimes possible to retrieve data after it has been deleted."<ref>{{cite web|title=How Snaps Are Stored And Deleted|url=http://blog.snapchat.com/post/50060403002/how-snaps-are-stored-and-deleted|work=Snapchat Blog|publisher=Snapchat|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=May 9, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708202131/http://blog.snapchat.com/post/50060403002/how-snaps-are-stored-and-deleted|archivedate=July 8, 2013}}</ref>

===Lens incidents===
In September 2015, an 18-year-old was using a Snapchat feature called "Lens" to record the speed she was driving her [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] [[C230]] when she crashed into a [[Mitsubishi]] [[Mitsubishi Outlander|Outlander]] in [[Hampton, Georgia]]. The {{convert|107|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} crash injured both drivers. The driver of the Outlander spent five weeks in [[intensive care]] while he was treated for severe [[traumatic brain injury]]. In April 2016, the Outlander driver sued both Snapchat and the user of Snapchat, alleging that Snapchat knew its application was being used in unlawful speed contests, yet did nothing to prevent such use so is negligent.<ref>{{cite news |title=Snapchat at 107 M.P.H.?

=== "Poor Country" remark ===
According to former Snapchat employee Anthony Pompliano in a lawsuit filed against Snap Inc.,&nbsp;Spiegel made a statement in 2015 that Snapchat is "only for rich people" and that he does not "want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain."<ref>{{cite web |first=Gene |last=Maddaus |title=Snapchat CEO Said 'This App Is Only for Rich People,' Ex-Employee Alleges |url=https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/snapchat-evan-spiegel-only-for-rich-people-anthony-pompliano-1202028526/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |date=April 11, 2017 |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}</ref> The incident sparked a [[Twitter#Trending topics|Twitter trend]] called "#UninstallSnapchat," in which Indian users uninstalled the app,<ref>{{cite web |first=Emma |last=Hinchcliffe |title=#UninstallSnapchat is taking off in India after an allegedly terrible comment from Snap's CEO |url=http://mashable.com/2017/04/15/uninstall-snapchat-india/ |website=[[Mashable]] |date=April 15, 2017 |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}</ref> and caused backlash against the company in terms of low "one-star" ratings for the app in the [[Google Play]] store and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Snapchat's App Rating Takes A Massive Hit On Play Store Thanks To 'Poor Indians', Spokesperson Issues Clarification |url=http://www.indiatimes.com/technology/apps/snapchat-s-app-rating-takes-a-massive-hit-on-play-store-thanks-to-poor-indians-spokesperson-issues-clarification-275743.html |website=[[The Times of India]] |publisher=[[The Times Group]] |date=April 16, 2017 |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}</ref><ref name="guardian-star"/> Snapchat's shares fell by 1.5%.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Noel |last1=Randewich |first2=David |last2=Ingram |title=Snap stock falls as alleged CEO comments rile some on social media |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-snap-stocks-idUSKBN17J1I5 |website=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |date=April 17, 2017 |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}</ref> In response to the allegation, Snapchat called Pompliano's claim "ridiculous," and elaborated that "Obviously Snapchat is for everyone.

=== Pompliano Lawsuit ===
In January 2017, former employee Anthony Pompliano filed a state lawsuit accusing Snapchat of doctoring growth metrics with the intention of deceiving investors. Pompliano said that CEO Evan Spiegel was dismissive of his concerns and that Pompliano was fired shortly thereafter. The judge dropped Pompliano’s claims that Snapchat violated the Dodd-Frank and Consumer Protection Acts in retaliation against him, citing an arbitration clause in his contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/snapchat-judge-pompliano-arbitration-1202750638/|title=Judge Shuts Down Snapchat Whistleblower's Lawsuit|last=Maddaus|first=Gene|date=2018-04-11|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> However, Snap Inc. faced blowback over a lack of disclosure regarding the contents of the lawsuit, resulting in plunging stock prices, several class-action lawsuits, and Federal investigations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/snaps-board-facing-blowback-not-disclosing-whistleblower-lawsuit-ipo-1202985|title=Snap's Board Facing Blowback for Not Disclosing Whistle-Blower Lawsuit in IPO|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>

==="Snap Map" privacy concerns===
The June 2017 release of "Snap Map," a feature that broadcasts the user's location on a map, was met with concerns over privacy and safety. The feature, through an opt-in, delivers a message asking if the user would like to show their position on the map, but reportedly doesn't explain the ramifications of doing so, including that the app updates the user's position on the map each time the app is opened and not just when actively capturing snaps, potentially assisting stalkers. The map can be zoomed in to feature detailed geographical information, such as street addresses.<ref name="verge-snap-map">{{cite web |first=Dani |last=Deahl |title=Snapchat's newest feature is also its biggest privacy threat |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/23/15864552/snapchat-snap-map-privacy-threat |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 23, 2017 |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that police forces had issued child safety warnings,<ref>{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Field |title=Police issue child safety warning over Snapchat maps update that reveals users' locations |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/06/23/police-issue-child-safety-warning-snapchat-maps-update-reveals/ |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]]  |date=June 23, 2017 |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}</ref> while other media publications wrote that safety concerns were also raised for teenagers and adults unaware of the feature's actual behavior.<ref name="verge-snap-map" /><ref>{{cite web |first=Olivia |last=Salon |title=Snapchat's new map feature raises fears of stalking and bullying |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/23/snapchat-maps-privacy-safety-concerns |website=[[The Guardian]]  |date=June 23, 2017 |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}</ref> In a statement to ''[[The Verge]]'', a Snapchat spokesperson said that "The safety of our community is very important to us and we want to make sure that all Snapchatters, parents, and educators have accurate information about how the Snap Map works".<ref name="verge-snap-map" />
Users have the ability to operate in "Ghost Mode," or select the friends that they wish to share their location with. Although there has been an increase in advertising on Snapchat, Snapchat has stated that they do not plan on running ads on Snap Map stories.

===Body image concerns===
The increased use of body and facial reshaping applications such as Snapchat and [[Facetune]] has been identified as a potential cause of [[body dysmorphic disorder]]. In August 2018, researchers from the [[Boston Medical Center]] wrote in a ''[[JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery]]'' essay that a phenomenon they called 'Snapchat dysmorphia' had been identified, where people request surgery to look like the edited version of themselves as they appear through Snapchat Filters.<ref>{{cite web |last1=MEDICAL CENTER |first1=BOSTON |title=A new reality for beauty standards: How selfies and filters affect body image |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-08/bmc-anr080118.php |website=eurekalert |publisher=the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) |accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>

In particular, the suit alleges that "because of the ways Snapchat is and has been designed, constructed, marketed, and maintained, [the woman's assailants] were able to send these nonconsensual, pornographic photographs and videos of [her] with little to no threat of law enforcement verifying that they did so."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Billman |first1=Jeffrey C. |title=Woman Whose Sexual-Assault Story Helped Change N.C.
