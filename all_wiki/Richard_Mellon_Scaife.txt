'''Richard Mellon Scaife''' ({{IPAc-en|s|k|eɪ|f}}; July 3, 1932&nbsp;– July 4, 2014) was an American billionaire, a principal heir to the [[Mellon family|Mellon]] banking, oil, and [[aluminum]] fortune, and the owner and publisher of the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]''. In 2005, Scaife was number 238 on the [[Forbes 400]], with a personal fortune of $1.2 billion.  By 2013, Scaife had dropped to number 371 on the listing, with a personal fortune of $1.4 billion.

During his life, Scaife was known for his financial support of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] public policy organizations over the past four decades. He provided support for conservative and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] causes in the United States, mostly through the private, nonprofit foundations he controlled: the [[Scaife Foundations#Sarah Scaife Foundation|Sarah Scaife Foundation]], [[Scaife Foundations#Carthage Foundation|Carthage Foundation]], and [[Scaife Foundations#Allegheny Foundation|Allegheny Foundation]], and until 2001, the [[Scaife Foundations#Scaife Family Foundatio|Scaife Family Foundation]], now controlled by son David.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaife121798.htm|title=Scaife Denies Ties to 'Conspiracy', Starr|work=Special Report: Clinton Accused|author=Robert G.

==Early life==
Scaife was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], to Alan Magee Scaife, the head of an affluent Pittsburgh family, and [[Sarah Mellon|Sarah Cordelia Mellon]], who was a member of the influential [[Mellon family]], one of the most powerful families in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/obituaries/2005/01/27/Obituary-Cordelia-Scaife-May-Reclusive-Mellon-heiress-known-for-her-generosity/stories/200501270185|title=Obituary: Cordelia Scaife May / Reclusive Mellon heiress known for her generosity|publisher=|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}</ref> Sarah was the niece of former United States Secretary of the Treasury [[Andrew W. Mellon]]. She and her brother, financier [[Richard King Mellon|R.K. Mellon]], were heirs to the Mellon fortune that included [[Mellon Financial|Mellon Bank]] and major stakes in [[Gulf Oil]] and [[Alcoa]] aluminum.

Scaife attended high school at [[Deerfield Academy]] in [[Deerfield, Massachusetts]] where he almost didn't graduate after getting caught drinking off campus at the age of 14.<ref name=DARKMONEY>{{cite book |last=Mayer |first=Jane |date= January 24, 2017|title=[[Dark Money (book)|Dark Money]] |url= |location= |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)| Anchor Books]] |page= 82 |isbn=978-0-307-94790-1 |authorlink=Jane Mayer }}</ref> He was expelled from [[Yale University]] in the aftermath of a drunken party in which he launched an empty beer keg down a flight of stairs, injuring a classmate. Yale gave him the opportunity to repeat his freshman year, but he continued to skip class and flunked out. With the help of his father, who was chairman of the board of trustees, he attended the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and graduated with a bachelor's degree in [[English language|English]] in 1957.<ref name="Karen Rothmyer: Citizen Scaife">{{cite book|editor=Herbert F. Vetter|title=Speak Out Against the New Right|url=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/speakout|date=2004-10-09|publisher=Harvard Square Library|isbn=1-58736-357-7|chapter=Karen Rothmyer: Citizen Scaife|chapterurl=http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/speakout/scaife.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050425101414/http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/speakout/|archivedate=April 25, 2005|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=McKibben |first=Bill |date=March 10, 2016 |title=The Koch Brothers' New Brand |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/03/10/koch-brothers-new-brand/ |magazine=The New York Review of Books |location=New York, NY |publisher=New York Review Books (NYRB) |access-date=February 19, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=DARKMONEY/>

Scaife inherited positions on several corporate boards in 1958 when his father Alan died unexpectedly. However, his family had become estranged from his uncle, R. K. Scaife, who retained control of the companies. His mother encouraged him to get involved in the family's philanthropic foundations, and he did so. (See [[#Management of the Scaife family foundations|management of Scaife family foundations]].) He inherited much of the Mellon fortune when his mother died in 1965. <ref name=washpostfoundations/>

A portion of the fortune was placed in trust funds and the rest in foundations.<ref name=washpostfoundations/> The trusts expired in 1985 and, per tax law, the foundations must give away 5% of their assets per year. Disbursements from each foundation are done through boards of directors.<ref name=washpostfoundations>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifedough050299.htm |newspaper=The Washington Post|title=Scaife's Foundations|author=The Washington Post Staff|date=May 9, 1999|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>

In 1973, he became estranged from his sister [[Cordelia Scaife May|Cordelia]] and he took control of many of the family foundations while Cordelia supported her own charities, including [[Planned Parenthood]] and the [[National Aviary]] in Pittsburgh. Shortly before her death, the siblings reconciled, and he eulogized her in January 2005,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05027/448744.stm|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|title=Obituary: Cordelia Scaife May/Reclusive Mellon heiress known for her generosity|first1=Johnna A.|last1=Pro|first2=Marylynne|last2=Pitz|date=January 27, 2005}}</ref> lauding Cordelia for devoting her life and resources to "worthwhile causes".<ref>[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/trib/regional/s_297308.html Philanthropist Cordelia Scaife May dies at 76] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219051641/http://pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/trib/regional/s_297308.html |date=February 19, 2006 }}, pittsburghlive.com; accessed August 3, 2014.</ref>

==Business==

===Purchase of the ''Tribune-Review''===
In 1970, Scaife purchased a small market newspaper, then known as the ''Tribune-Review''. The paper was based in [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Greensburg]], the county seat and center of [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]], located about 30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. For a number of years, the paper was published and distributed only in the Westmoreland area.<ref name="pittsburghlive.com">[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/specialreports/10year/s_104854.html "Another voice in town"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722030033/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/specialreports/10year/s_104854.html |date=July 22, 2009 }}, pittsburghlive.com; accessed August 3, 2014.</ref>

Scaife made headlines in the fall of 1973 when a ''Tribune-Review'' reporter was fired for making the remark "one down and one to go" during the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] era when Vice President [[Spiro T. Agnew]] resigned over corruption charges dating back to his days as [[governor of Maryland]]. In the controversy that followed nearly half the paper's 24 person newsroom staff resigned.  In 1992, the two main newspapers in Pittsburgh were embroiled in a lengthy labor dispute that ultimately led the larger paper, the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'', to cease operations, and for the remaining paper, the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', to suspend publication for nearly six months until the ''Post-Gazette'' acquired the ''Press'' late that year.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DB1531F933A05752C1A964958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fS%2fStrikes|newspaper=The New York Times|title=The Media Business; Press Unions Support Sale|date=November 30, 1992|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

During this time, Scaife expanded operations of his newspaper into Pittsburgh.  He essentially created a newspaper from the ground up and named it the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'' while maintaining the Greensburg operation separately. He moved the Pittsburgh headquarters to the D. L. Clark building on Martindale Street on Pittsburgh's North Side.

===Leadership and media interests===
The ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review'' continues to challenge the ''Post-Gazette'' in the Pittsburgh media market. Twelve years after Scaife's newspaper began publishing, the ''Post-Gazette'' reported major financial losses, and the unions representing its employees agreed to wage concessions to keep it afloat. Unlike Scaife, the owners of the Post-Gazette, the Block family, were unwilling to sustain major losses year after year. According to the Scaife divorce papers, Richard Scaife has consistently spent between $20 and $30 million per year to cover the ''Tribune-Review'''s losses.<ref name="post-gazette.com">{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07266/819835-85.stm|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|title=Scaife demands documents from Post-Gazette|first=Steve|last=Twedt|date=September 23, 2007}}</ref> According to the [[Alliance for Audited Media|Audit Bureau of Circulation]], the Tribune-Review has a combined 221,000 regional circulation, about 7,000 subscribers fewer than its competitor.

In 2005, the ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review'' announced that operations of its suburban editions would be consolidated, with "staff reductions" in the newsrooms, business, and circulation departments.<ref>[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/business/s_295006.html "Tribune-Review to reorganize papers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404123743/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/business/s_295006.html |date=April 4, 2005 }}, ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review''; accessed August 13, 2014.</ref> Two managers were laid off immediately along with several other staff members later in 2005.

With Scaife as publisher, the small circulation newspaper was the chief packager of editorials and news columns claiming that then United States President [[Bill Clinton]] or his wife, then First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] were responsible for the death of Deputy White House counsel [[Vince Foster]]. Scaife paid freelancer [[Christopher Ruddy]] to write about the Foster case for the ''Tribune-Review'' and other right-leaning media.<ref>[http://www.newsmax.com/pundits/ruddy.shtml?CFID=10964423&CFTOKEN=74004037 Newsmax.com coverage of Vince Foster death]; accessed August 13, 2014.</ref> Special Prosecutor [[Ken Starr]], appointed to investigate Clinton, concluded Foster had, in fact, committed suicide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3613/is_199603/ai_n8746583|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050409182303/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3613/is_199603/ai_n8746583|url-status=dead|archive-date=2005-04-09|title=The Vince Foster factory|work=Columbia Journalism Review}} </ref>

In 2004, Scaife was reported to own 7.2 percent of [[Newsmax Media]], a news-based Web site with conservative political content founded by Ruddy in 1998.<ref>Poe, Richard. ''Hillary's Secret War: The Clinton Conspiracy to Muzzle Internet Journalists''. Thomas Nelson, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7852-6013-7}}</ref> In 2009, Scaife reportedly controlled 42% of NewsMax, with Ruddy the 58% majority owner, CEO and editor.<ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/rush-limbaugh-matt-drudge-trail/story.aspx?guid={883092D6-6945-482D-B099-F9580F893FB2}&dist=TNMostRead "Chris Ruddy: Conservatives' great online ally: He's a bigger Internet star than Rush Limbaugh"], Commentary by Jon Friedman, ''MarketWatch'', March 13, 2009; retrieved August 13, 2014.</ref>

Scaife owned a majority interest in Pittsburgh-based all-news radio station [[KQV]].

From 1977 to 1989 Scaife owned the ''[[Sacramento Union]]'' newspaper in the state capital of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Richard Mellon Scaife, billionaire who once owned Sacramento Union, dies |url=https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/obituaries/article2602948.html |accessdate=3 February 2019 |date=5 July 2014}}</ref>

===Support for Richard Nixon===
As early as 1968, Scaife was actively involved at the highest levels of the Nixon campaign.  He was appointed to lead the United Citizens for Nixon-Agnew during the fall of 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal68-1282669&PHPSESSID=4pimm8s73o9i5sjnh97inqed46|title=CQ Almanac Online Edition|website=library.cqpress.com|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}</ref>

Scaife gained notoriety for evading weak [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign finance laws]] to donate US$990,000 to the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President|1972 re-election]] [[1972 United States presidential election|campaign]] of U.S. President [[Richard M. Nixon]]. Scaife was not charged with a crime, but about $45,000 went to a fund linked to the [[Watergate scandal]]. Scaife later said he was repulsed by the scandal and refused to speak with Nixon after 1973. Following [[Robert Duggan]]'s suicide and then Watergate, he shifted his political giving from politicians' campaigns to [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] research groups, legal defense funds, and publications.<ref name=Kaiser1999>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifemain050399b.htm|title=Money, Family Name Shaped Scaife.

===Opposition to Bill Clinton===
Scaife's publications were substantially involved in coverage against then-President [[Bill Clinton]]:
* Scaife was the major backer of ''[[The American Spectator]]'', whose [[Arkansas Project]] set out to find facts about Clinton and in which [[Paula Jones]]' accusations of [[sexual harassment]] against Clinton were first widely publicized.
* On April 15, 1998, ''The New York Times'' revealed that Scaife had spent nearly $2 million on the project.<ref>Neil A. Lewis.[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30F16FF3D580C768DDDAD0894D0494D81 Almost $2 Million Spent in Magazine's Anti-Clinton Project, but on What?]. New York Times. April 15, 1998</ref>
* In a 1999 series of articles on Scaife and foundations that support conservative causes, ''The Washington Post'' named a close Scaife associate, Richard Larry, and not Scaife himself as the man who drove the Arkansas Project,<ref name=Kaiser1999/><ref name=washpost050299>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifemain050299.htm|title=Scaife: Funding Father of the Right|author=Robert G. Kaiser|author2=Ira Chinoy |page=A1|work=The Washington Post|date=May 2, 1999|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref> while also acknowledging that Scaife was still the project's lead financier.<ref name=Kaiser1999/><ref name=washpost050299 /> The question of how political intellectualism was centered in the subject or in his key aides, such as Richard Larry, R. Daniel McMichael, or others, remains an open question.<ref>Mayer, Jane. (2016). Dark money: the hidden history of the billionaires behind the rise of the radical right. New York: Doubleday. p. 83. {{ISBN|978-0-385-53559-5}}.</ref>

The project not only accused Clinton of financial and sexual indiscretions (some later verified, others not), but also gave root to [[Conspiracy theory#Conspiracism|conspiracist]] notions that the Clintons collaborated with the CIA to run a drug smuggling operation out of the town of [[Mena, Arkansas]] and that Clinton had arranged for the murder of [[White House]] aide [[Vince Foster]] as part of a coverup of the [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater scandal]]. The possibility that money from the project had been given to former Clinton associate [[David Hale (Whitewater)|David Hale]], a witness in the Whitewater investigation, led to the appointment of Michael J. Shaheen as a special investigator. Shaheen [[subpoena]]ed Scaife, who testified before a federal [[grand jury]] in the matter.

In the fall of 2007, however, Ruddy published a positive interview with former President Clinton on [[Newsmax.com]], followed by a positive cover story in the magazine. ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted with reference to the event that politics had made "[[wikt:Strange bedfellows|strange bedfellows]]".<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bill Clinton Gives Interview to Former Foe|first=Patrick|last=Healy|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/bill-clinton-gives-interview-to-former-foe|work=The Caucus. The Politics and Government Blog of the Times|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=2007-11-01|accessdate=2010-09-14}}</ref>

''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that Ruddy praised Clinton for his Foundation's global work, and explained that the interview, as well as a private lunch he and Scaife had had with Clinton, which Ruddy says was orchestrated by [[Ed Koch]], were due to his shared view, with Scaife that Clinton was doing important work representing the U.S. globally while America was the target of criticism. He also said that he and Scaife had never suggested Clinton was involved in Foster's death, nor had they spread allegations about Clinton's sex scandals, although their work may have encouraged others.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/69545|title=So Happy Together.

Despite his political opposition to Clinton, the two men forged a friendship after Clinton left office. They became so close that Clinton spoke at a private memorial service for Scaife on August 2, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vogel|first1=Kenneth|title=Bill Clinton eulogizes Richard Mellon Scaife: Nemesis, then friend|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/bill-clinton-richard-mellon-scaife-eulogy-109670.html?hp=f1|website=www.politico.com|publisher=Politico|accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref>

===Political donations===
According to campaignmoney.com, from 1999 through 2006, Scaife, under the name "R. Scaife", made ten contributions of over $200 to political campaigns, for a total of $19,000. Under the name "R.M. Scaife", he made four donations totaling $22,000. Under the name "Richard Scaife", he made 23 donations over this period which totaled $142,904. Besides donations to the [[Republican National Committee]] and various political campaigns such as Santorum 2000 and the Santorum Victory Committee for [[Rick Santorum]], he has also supported [[political action committee]]s such as the Pro-Growth Action Team, the Free Congress PAC (formerly: Committee For the Survival Of a Free Congress), and the [[Club for Growth]] Inc. PAC. Scaife also funded the [[Western Journalism Center]], headed by [[Joseph Farah]]. He was named to the [[PoliticsPA]] list of "Pennsylvania's Top Political Activists".<ref name=activists>{{Cite web| title = Pennsylvania's Top Political Activists| work = [[PoliticsPA]]| publisher =The Publius Group | year = 2002| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021113050121/http://www.politicspa.com/features/political_activists.htm| url = http://www.politicspa.com/features/political_activists.htm|archivedate=2002-11-13}}</ref>

===Management of the Scaife family foundations===
When Scaife refocused his political giving away from individuals and toward anti-communist research groups, legal defense funds, and publications, the first among these was the [[Hoover Institution]] on War, Revolution, and Peace at [[Stanford University]].

Through contacts made at Hoover and elsewhere, Scaife became a major, early supporter of [[The Heritage Foundation]], which has since become one of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington's]] most influential public policy research institutes. He served as vice-chairman of the Heritage Foundation board of trustees.<ref>
[http://www.heritage.org/About/Departments/trustees.cfm Heritage Foundation Board of Trustees, heritage.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304025805/http://www.heritage.org/About/Departments/trustees.cfm |date=March 4, 2010 }}</ref>

Later, he supported such varied conservative and libertarian organizations as:
* [[American Enterprise Institute]]
* [[Atlas Economic Research Foundation]]
* [[David Horowitz Freedom Center]]
* [[Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow]], which advocates for free-market solutions to environmental issues and dissent on [[Attribution of recent climate change|anthropogenic global warming]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/10/us/politics/10morano.html?_r=1&hp "Dissenter on Warming Expands His Campaign"] by Leslie Kaufman, ''The New York Times'', April 10, 2009; retrieved August 13, 2014.</ref>
* [[Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives]], a Harrisburg-based libertarian think tank<ref>[http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/02/scaife200802 "A Vast Right-Wing Hypocrisy": Politics & Power], vanityfair.com, February 2008; accessed August 13, 2014.</ref>
* [[Federalist Society]]
* [[Foundation for Economic Education]]
* Free Congress Foundation (headed by [[Jim Gilmore]])
* [[Freedom House]]
* [[GOPAC]] (headed by [[Newt Gingrich]])
* [[Independent Women's Forum]]
* [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]] (which operates the [[Collegiate Network]])
* [[Judicial Watch]]
* [[Landmark Legal Foundation]]
* The Media Institute
* [[Media Research Center]] (headed by [[L. Brent Bozell III|Brent Bozell]])
* [[Pacific Legal Foundation]]
* [[Reason Foundation]]

By 1998, his foundations were listed among donors to over 100 such groups, to which he had disbursed some $340 million by 2002.<ref>Media Transparency, {{cite web|url=http://www.mediatransparency.org/scaifeaggregate.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608130352/http://www.mediatransparency.org/scaifeaggregate.php |archivedate=June 8, 2007 }} Aggregated Grants from the Scaife Foundations.</ref>

===Pepperdine University===
Scaife also endowed a new school of public policy at [[Pepperdine University]]. [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Independent Counsel]] [[Kenneth Starr]] was named the first dean of this school. Pepperdine has denied any connection between Scaife and the selection of Starr. Starr accepted the post in 1996, but in the ensuing controversy, he gave up the appointment in 1998 before ever having started at Pepperdine. After the investigation, Starr was appointed to head Pepperdine's law school in 2004, and became president of [[Baylor University]] in 2010.<ref>Bobby Ross, Jr. [http://www.christianchronicle.org/article2159033~Kenneth_Starr_plans_to_join_Baptist_church "Kenneth Starr plans to join Baptist church"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612092704/http://www.christianchronicle.org/article2159033~Kenneth_Starr_plans_to_join_Baptist_church |date=June 12, 2013 }}, ''Christian Chronicle, April 2010, page 1; accessed May 19, 2010.</ref>

===Other philanthropic support===
Scaife was identified with his contributions to conservative and libertarian causes. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1999 dubbed him "funding father of the Right." 

However, Scaife supported certain policy research groups which are not explicitly conservative, such as the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] (CSIS), the [[National Endowment for Democracy]] (NED), and the [[Foreign Policy Research Institute]] (FPRI), at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], among others. He was also a major donor to abortion rights advocates, including [[Planned Parenthood]], giving "[[million]]s" to the organization, although most of the donations ended in the 1970s, according to ''The Washington Post.''<ref name=washpost050299/>

In the late 1990s, during the height of the Clinton scandals, Scaife nevertheless continued to provide more than $1 million to the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], the prime benefactor of the [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS). His donations to restore and beautify the [[White House]] led to an invitation by Hillary Clinton for a black-tie celebration. She warmly received him and posed for a photograph on the same day her husband's sex scandal hit the press. Scaife told the ''[[New York Post]]'' that he appreciated Mrs. Clinton's invitation. "I'm honored", he said, "Lord knows, it's more than I got from [the first] George Bush".<ref>{{Cite news|title=There's a liberal side to 'right-winger' Dick Scaife Endowment won Clinton's handshake|first=Bill |last=Sammon|work= Washington Times|location=Washington, D.C.|date= April 28, 1998 |page= A.1}}</ref>

Scaife also supported non-political groups. He was a key benefactor of a number of Pittsburgh-based arts organizations: [[Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra]], the Sarah Scaife Galleries at the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh]] art museum, the Brandywine Conservancy, the Phipps Conservatory, and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., as well as [[Goodwill Industries]] of Pittsburgh. He and his foundations contributed to Sarah Scaife's favorite causes: population control (e.g. [[Planned Parenthood]]), environmental conservation, and hospitals; [[Jonas Salk]] developed his [[polio vaccine]] in a Sarah Scaife funded laboratory. He also supported a variety of educational institutions, notably the [[University of Chicago]], [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] at [[Tufts University]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Boston University]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], the [[University of Rochester]], [[Smith College]], [[Bowling Green State University]], and his prep school, [[Deerfield Academy]].

==Personal life==
Scaife's first marriage was to Frances L. Gilmore (born December 2, 1934). The couple had two children, Jennie K. Scaife (born July 8, 1963; died November 29, 2018), and David N. Scaife (born February 5, 1966). The couple subsequently divorced.

In June 1991, he married his longtime companion Margaret "Ritchie" Battle (born February 15, 1947), who had made the couple active in the social and cultural life of Pittsburgh. The couple subsequently separated, and, on December 27, 2005, the [[Pittsburgh Police]] responded to a call placed by Richard Scaife reporting trespassing at Scaife's residence in the prestigious [[Shadyside (Pittsburgh)|Shadyside section of Pittsburgh]]. They arrived to find his estranged wife, pounding on doors and peeking in windows of the couple's mansion. Mrs. Scaife refused to leave the property, and was arrested and charged with defiant [[trespass]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Tribune-Review publisher's wife charged with trespass|accessdate=2010-09-14|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05361/628424.stm|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=December 27, 2005}}</ref>

On April 8, 2006, the ''Tribune-Review'' published an article describing a fight between Scaife's estranged wife and three of his servants over a dog that Scaife told the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' his wife had given him. Both newspapers reported that Scaife's servants went to the hospital for scrapes and bruises after the fracas.<ref name="nydailynews.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/407693p-345144c.html |title=Celebrity Scandals and Gossip, NY Daily News |accessdate=2006-04-13 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060413170317/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/407693p-345144c.html |archivedate=April 13, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref> Scaife later hung a sign on his lawn: "Wife and dog missing - reward for dog".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article3216596.ece|title=Sex and tongs - it's divorce billionaire-style|newspaper=The Sunday Times|author=Tony Allen-Mills|date=January 20, 2008|accessdate=2008-01-20|location=London, UK}}</ref> Three days later, on April 11, Scaife confided to a gossip columnist that he and Margaret Scaife planned to divorce and that their marriage began without a prenuptial agreement. The ''New York Daily News'' column estimated his vulnerable assets at half of $1.2 billion.<ref name="nydailynews.com"/>

In September 2007, the ''Post-Gazette'' and reporter [[Dennis Roddy]] found that the Scaife divorce papers, which had been under seal, were available to the public on the Web site of the Allegheny County Prothonotary's office. The ''Post-Gazette'' made the divorce papers available in full on its site.<ref name="post-gazette.com"/> The papers include a full list of the possessions Margaret Scaife alleged her husband had taken and was keeping from her.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/21/AR2007102101643_pf.html|work=The Washington Post|title=Low Road to Splitsville|first=David|last=Segal|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

He was named to the [[PoliticsPA]] list of "Sy Snyder's Power 50" list of influential individuals in Pennsylvania politics in 2002 and 2003.<ref name=power>{{Cite web|title=Sy Snyder's Power 50|work=[[PoliticsPA]]|publisher=The Publius Group|year=2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020421165540/http://www.politicspa.com/features/power50.htm|url=http://www.politicspa.com/features/power50.htm|archivedate=2002-04-21}}</ref><ref name=power2003>{{Cite web|title=Power 50|work=[[PoliticsPA]]|publisher=The Publius Group|year=2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040417135307/http://www.politicspa.com/features/power502003.htm|url=http://www.politicspa.com/features/power502003.htm|archivedate=2004-04-17}}</ref>

On May 18, 2014, he announced that his doctors had diagnosed him with an untreatable form of cancer as part of an introspective column in the ''Tribune-Review''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://triblive.com/news/editorspicks/6132589-74/newspapers-lives-media|title=What matters most|newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|author=Richard Mellon Scaife|date=May 18, 2014|accessdate=2014-05-18|location=Pittsburgh, PA}}</ref>

==Steve Kangas incident==
On February 8, 1999 former [[military intelligence]] specialist and progressive writer [[Steve Kangas]] committed suicide less than 60 feet (18 m) from Scaife's office door inside [[One Oxford Centre]] in Pittsburgh. He had been an outspoken critic of Scaife and believed that Scaife-funded initiatives posed a danger to the nation. Scaife hired [[Rex Armistead]] and a reporter from the ''Tribune-Review'' to investigate whether or not Kangas had been out to kill Scaife.<ref name="Craig">{{cite news|last=Craig Jr.|first=John|title=Mission: Implausible|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/forum/19990328edcraig4.asp|accessdate=October 25, 2010|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=March 28, 1999}}</ref>
