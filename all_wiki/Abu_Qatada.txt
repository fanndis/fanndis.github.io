Abu Qatada, who was born Omar Mahmoud Othman, has Jordanian nationality because he was born in [[Bethlehem]] in the [[West Bank]] in 1960, which at that time [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|was ruled]] by Jordan. In 1989, he went to [[Peshawar]] in Pakistan where he served as a professor of ''[[sharia]]'' sciences.<ref>{{cite news|title=Investigating Al-Qaeda|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/02/september_11/investigating_al_qaeda/html/people/other_suspects.stm|accessdate=14 November 2012|work=[[BBC News]]|year=2003}}</ref><ref>{{Google books|XShcCF072FEC&dq|Global Jihadism:Theory and Practice|page=72}}</ref> He obtained his [[Bachelor's]] in [[Islamic jurisprudence]] in 1984 while in Jordan<ref>Jakob Skovgaard-Petersen, "The King, the Boy, the Monk and the Magician: Jihadi Ideological Entrepreneurship between the UK and Denmark" in ''Exploring the Multitude of Muslims in Europe: Essays in Honour of Jørgen S.

It says that the matzos eaten by the Jews on their holiday must be consecrated with the blood of a man from among the Gentiles. Usually they take a Christian because they cannot overpower a Muslim.

The Jews run the global economy, that is a fact. Do you want me to give you the numbers? Can any rational person who has read the history of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] deny that it was won due to the support of the Jews, and the Jewish money of the Rothschild family? Can anyone deny that Lenin was Jewish?

==Persona non-grata==

Abu Qatada was reported in February 2012 as being wanted on terrorism charges in the United States, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Italy and Algeria.<ref name=sermons/> Jordan convicted Abu Qatada ''in absentia''; but the conviction did not hold when he appealed in person, after his removal from the UK, where he had spent over a decade in front of various courts in an ultimately vain attempt to avoid deportation. Summaries of these two procedures are given below, in the next two sections.

===Convictions in Jordan and retrial acquittals===

In 1999, Abu Qatada was sentenced ''in absentia'' by Jordan to life imprisonment with hard labour for conspiracy to carry out terror attacks, and subsequently he was convicted in 2000 to a further 25 years for his involvement in a [[2000 millennium attack plots#Jordan bombing plot|plot to bomb tourists attending millennium celebrations in Jordan]].<ref name="Guardian 07Feb2012"/> The 1999 conviction related to events described by the US State Department in 1998 as involving the "Reform and Defiance Movement—a small, mostly indigenous radical Islamic group" targeting the [[Modern American School (Jordan)|Modern American School]] and a major hotel between mid-March and early May, with bombings which caused minor property damage but no casualties.<ref>U.S. State Department, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=-r15UZagHsjL0QXN3IDwAw&id=1vjCPqdljFIC&dq=%22modern+american+school%22+jordan+1998&q=#search_anchor Patterns of Global Terrorism 1999] p29</ref><ref>Referred to in the 2009 Law Lords judgement as the "'Reform and Challenge' case". [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldjudgmt/jd090218/rbalge.pdf para 42]</ref>

In 2008, the UK Court of Appeal concluded "that his 1999 conviction for terrorism was based on evidence extracted through torture".<ref name=Guardiantimeline/> At Abu Qatada's 2012 SIAC hearing, [[List of High Court judges of England and Wales|Mr Justice Mitting]] observed that the evidence presented by Jordan against Abu Qatada "seems extremely thin".<ref>{{cite news|last=Marsden|first=Sam|title=Evidence against Abu Qatada 'extremely thin', claims appeal judge|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9598781/Evidence-against-Abu-Qatada-extremely-thin-claims-appeal-judge.html|accessdate=13 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 October 2012}}</ref> Overall, between 2007 and his deportation in 2013, as many as 12 senior British judges in various courts recognised the torture origins of the evidence against him.<ref name = "Brittain 07Jul2013">{{Cite web|author=Victoria Brittain|date=7 July 2013|title=I know Abu Qatada – he's no terrorist|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/07/abu-qatada-no-terrorist|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>

Upon returning to Jordan in July 2013, he exercised his right under Jordanian law to a retrial since he was originally convicted in absentia. A Jordanian military court refused to grant him bail during the retrial as he faced terrorism charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23397002|title=Abu Qatada refused bail in Jordan|date=21 July 2013|publisher=BBC}}</ref> His trial took place in the [[State Security Court]] in Amman.

===Arrest and detention in UK===
In February 2001, Abu Qatada was arrested and questioned in connection with a German terror cell. There was insufficient evidence against him, and all charges were dropped. Tapes of his sermons were later discovered in a Hamburg flat used by the [[9/11]] hijackers.<ref name="Indie 22Feb2002">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/abu-qatada-costs-will-rise-to-3m-7282738.html |title=Abu Qatada costs 'will rise to £3m' |author=Paul Peachey |date=22 February 2012 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref> The [[Home Office]] stated that Abu Qatada was the spiritual guide to the 9/11 ringleader [[Mohamed Atta]].<ref name="Guardian 07Feb2012">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/07/abu-qatada-spiritual-leader-islamist |title=Abu Qatada: spiritual leader for deadly Islamist groups? |author=Robert Booth |date=7 February 2012 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>

In the wake of 9/11, new anti-terror legislation was quickly introduced in the UK. Abu Qatada, who had hitherto lived with his family in [[Acton, London|Acton]], west London, disappeared. His disappearance and his previous alleged contacts with [[MI5]], prompted speculation by the ''Times'' that he was working with British intelligence and had agreed to provide them with information on suspects in the "[[war on terror]]". The Times reported that "Britain ignored warnings—which began before the 11 September attacks—from half a dozen friendly governments about Abu Qatada's links with terrorist groups and refused to arrest him. Intelligence chiefs hid from European allies their intention to use the cleric as a key informer against Islamic militants in Britain."<ref name="Times 25Mar2004">{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/article1969239.ece |title=Al-Qaeda cleric exposed as an MI5 double agent |author1=Daniel McGrory |author2=Richard Ford |date=25 March 2004 |newspaper=The Times |accessdate=1 March 2012}}</ref>

According to ''The Guardian'':

{{Quote | style=font-size:100% | text=The US, aided by the UK, on behalf of its key ally Jordan, went so far as to kidnap UK residents Jamil el-Banna and Bisher al-Rawi on a business trip in Africa, torture them in [[Bagram]] airbase in [[Afghanistan]], and take them to [[Guantánamo Bay]] in order to interrogate them about Othman [aka Abu Qatada]. When those men sued the British authorities for what they had done, parliament was persuaded to create secret courts to adjudicate on secret defences.<ref name = "Brittain 07Jul2013"/> }}

Members of the EDL and others besieged the Abu Qatada's family home every Saturday, and the police only put an end to the severe, and reportedly terrifying, harassment after a court case forced them to.<ref name = "Brittain 07Jul2013"/> The duration and location of his detention—without charge or trial—was described by one British judge as "lamentable&nbsp;... extraordinary&nbsp;... hardly, if at all, acceptable".<ref name = "Brittain 07Jul2013"/>

====2002–2008====
In October 2002, Abu Qatada was arrested in south London and taken to [[Belmarsh Prison]]. Here he began a long legal battle against deportation.<ref>{{cite news |work=BBC News |title=Profile: Abu Qatada |date= 26 February 2007 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4141594.stm |accessdate= 3 March 2012}}</ref> In October 2002, the then [[Home Secretary]], [[David Blunkett]], detained Abu Qatada indefinitely without trial under Part 4 of the [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] (ATCSA), which at that time provided for such detention.<ref name="Guardian 26.10.2002">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/oct/26/september11.politics |title=Judges back terror law detention |author=Audrey Gillan |date=26 October 2002 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref> The Special Immigration Appeals Commission subsequently rejected an appeal by Abu Qatada to be released from detention without trial.<ref name="BBC 23.03.2004"/>

Abu Qatada claimed he feared he would be tortured were he to return to Jordan. During this period Abu Qatada lived in a legal twilight as Asim Qureshi, of UK-based human rights group [[CagePrisoners]], explained: "He has not been able to see the evidence against him neither has his lawyer. The only person representing him is a special advocate who is not allowed to speak to him or his solicitor.

In 2005, Part 4 of ATCSA was replaced by the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]], which replaced detentions with control orders, and Abu Qatada was released under such a control order. Five months later, on 12 August 2005, Abu Qatada was detained again pending deportation to Jordan.<ref name="Home Office 2007">{{cite web |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news/abu-qatada-judgment |title=Court rules that Abu Qatada can be deported |date=26 February 2007 |publisher=[[Home Office]] |accessdate=22 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227123338/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news/abu-qatada-judgment |archivedate=27 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Threats to UK security' detained|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4141000.stm|accessdate=8 February 2012|work=[[BBC News]]|date=12 August 2005}}</ref> A British court ruled on 26 February 2007 that he could be deported to Jordan.<ref name="Home Office 2007"/>

On 9 April 2008, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] ruled that Abu Qatada could not be returned to Jordan as he would face a further trial where there was a strong probability that evidence obtained by torture might be used; therefore, extradition would amount to a breach of the United Kingdom's obligations under [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights]].<ref name="Guardian 10.04.2008">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/10/terrorism.terrorism |title=Appeal judges bar removal of 'key al-Qaida deputy' |author=Alan Travis |date=10 April 2008 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref> He was released on bail by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission on 8 May 2008, subject to a 22-hour home curfew and other restrictions.

In November 2008, Abu Qatada was rearrested at his home. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission revoked his bail, stating he had not broken bail conditions, but might do at some time in the future.

The Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] said the government would appeal the decision.<ref name="BBC 12 November 2012"/> Abu Qatada's solicitor [[Gareth Peirce]], commenting on the ruling, said: "It is important to reaffirm this country's position that we abhor the use of torture and a case that was predicated upon evidence from witnesses who have been tortured is rejected—rejected by the courts of this country as by the European Court".<ref name="The Independent 12 November 2012"/> Nevertheless the ruling attracted criticism that SIAC had effectively overturned the 2009 ruling of the House of Lords, at the time the highest court of the land.<ref>{{cite news|title=A mockery of justice|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/9672467/A-mockery-of-justice.html|accessdate=13 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=13 November 2012}}</ref> The Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] expressed his frustration that Abu Qatada was still in the UK.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cameron 'Fed Up' With Abu Qatada Still in UK|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1011086/cameron-fed-up-with-abu-qatada-still-in-uk|accessdate=14 November 2012|publisher=[[Sky News]]|date=13 November 2012}}</ref>

In March 2013, Abu Qatada was rearrested after allegedly breaching his bail conditions. On 27 March, the Court of Appeal rejected the Home Secretary's appeal from the November 2012 SIAC ruling<ref>http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2013/277.html</ref> and, in April 2013, denied her leave to appeal, on the basis that "states cannot expel someone where there is a real risk that they will face a trial based on evidence obtained by torture".<ref name=Guardiantimeline/>

In May 2013, Abu Qatada pledged he would leave the UK if the UK and Jordanian governments agreed and ratified a treaty clarifying that evidence gained through torture would not be used against him in his forthcoming trial. On 7 July 2013, following the ratification of such a treaty, Abu Qatada was deported from the United Kingdom on a plane bound for Jordan from [[RAF Northolt]].<ref name=northolt>{{cite news|title=Abu Qatada deported from UK to stand trial in Jordan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23213740|accessdate=7 July 2013|work=[[BBC News]]|date=7 July 2013}}</ref>

Abu Qatada's struggle against deportation, and the underlying UK policy of "deportation with assurances", were documented in a study by the UK's [[Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/deportation-with-assurances|title=Deportation with assurances |website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-20}}</ref>

In June 2014, a court in Jordan cleared Abu Qatada of involvement in a 1998 bombing campaign, and in September 2014 he was cleared of planning to attack millennium celebrations. He was released from prison on 24 September 2014.<ref name="DM 24 September 2014"/>

By July 2015, Abu Qatada had re-surfaced in an interview for the al Nusra magazine ''Al Risalah'' explaining that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was to be opposed because he "committed great atrocities against the Muslims, and this is why we are forced to speak out against them", while specifically qualifying that opposition to ISIL did not include distaste for their acts against Americans or westerners: "We don’t oppose ISIS because they oppose the enemies of Allah&nbsp;... only because ISIS makes [[takfir]] on the Muslims and kills them do I and others have the right to speak against them, even if it is an Islamic state."{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
