== History and founding ==
Dream Defenders was founded after a group of activists marched from [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona]] to [[Sanford, Florida]] in order to protest [[Trayvon Martin]]'s death and the failure to arrest his killer [[George Zimmerman]]. Gabriel Pendas,  and Phillip Agnew knew each other from activist work at [[Florida A&M University]], and came together to plan an event. They contacted [[Ciara Taylor]] and Nelini Stamp - other activists with similar goals.<ref name="Nec Trouble">{{cite book|last1=Jaffe|first1=Sarah|title=Necessary Trouble: Americans in Revolt|date=August 23, 2016|publisher=PublicAffairs|pages=134–137}}</ref>

== Ciara Taylor ==

Taylor, one of the founders, grew up in the suburbs in Florida and attended [[Florida A&M University]] in [[Tallahassee]].<ref name="Nec Trouble" /> She served as both the political director and the director of political consciousness at Dream Defenders. In high school, Taylor protested the United States 2000 presidential election, between [[Al Gore]] and [[George W. Bush]], after Bush was elected president. Taylor felt frustrated and hopeless in this process because she felt as though she could not actively influence the decision being made about her soon-to-be president.<ref name="Nec Trouble" /><ref name="Essence">{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=Lisa|title=The New Civil Rights Leaders|url=http://www.essence.com/2014/11/03/new-civil-rights-leaders|website=Essence|accessdate=March 22, 2017|date=October 31, 2014}}</ref> She continued this activism into college at Florida A&M, where she advocated for living wages for campus workers and advocated against budget cuts that defunded her major a year before she graduated.
