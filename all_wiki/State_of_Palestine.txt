When the Palestine National Council proclaimed in November 1988 the establishment of a Palestinian State, it asserted that Jerusalem was its capital. In October 2002, the Palestinian Legislative Council adopted the Law on the Capital, which stipulates that Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinian State, the main seat of its three branches of government. The State of Palestine is the sovereign of Jerusalem and of its holy places. Any statute or agreement that diminishes the rights of the Palestinian State in Jerusalem is invalid. This statute can be amended only with the consent of two-thirds of the members of the Legislative Council. The 2003 Basic Law also asserts that Jerusalem is the capital of the State of Palestine. }} Reprinted from: [[Rüdiger Wolfrum|Wolfrum, Rüdiger]] (ed.) (online 2008, print 2011).

=== Terminology ===
This article uses the terms "Palestine", "State of Palestine", "occupied Palestinian territory" (oPt or OPT) interchangeably depending on context. Specifically, the term "occupied Palestinian territory" refers as a whole to the geographical area of the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel since 1967. In all cases, any references to land or territory refer to land claimed by the State of Palestine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/CCA_Report_En.pdf|title=Common Country Analysis 2016: Leave No One Behind: A Perspective on Vulnerability and Structural Disadvantage in Palestine |publisher=United Nations Country Team Occupied Palestinian Territory |date=2016 |page=9}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of the State of Palestine}}
{{See also|History of Palestine}}
In 1947, the UN adopted a [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partition plan]] for a two-state solution in the remaining territory of the mandate. The plan was accepted by the Jewish leadership but rejected by the Arab leaders, and Britain refused to implement the plan. On the eve of final British withdrawal, the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] declared the establishment of the [[State of Israel]] according to the proposed UN plan. The [[Arab Higher Committee]] did not declare a state of its own and instead, together with [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], [[Egypt]], and the other members of the [[Arab League]] of the time, commenced military action resulting in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. During the war, Israel gained additional territories that were designated to be part of the Arab state under the UN plan. Egypt [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|occupied]] the Gaza Strip and Transjordan [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|occupied and then annexed]] the West Bank. Egypt initially supported the creation of an [[All-Palestine Government]], but disbanded it in 1959. Transjordan never recognized it and instead decided to incorporate the West Bank with its own territory to form [[Jordan]]. [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|The annexation]] was ratified in 1950 but was rejected by the international community. The [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, when Israel fought against Egypt, Jordan, and [[Syria]], ended with [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|Israel occupying the West Bank]] and the Gaza Strip, besides other territories.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

In 1964, when the West Bank was controlled by Jordan, the Palestine Liberation Organization was established there with the goal to confront Israel. The [[Palestinian National Charter]] of the PLO defines the boundaries of Palestine as the whole remaining territory of the mandate, including Israel. Following the Six-Day War, the PLO moved to Jordan, but later relocated to [[Lebanon]] after [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]] in 1971.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

The October [[1974 Arab League summit]] designated the PLO as the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people" and reaffirmed "their right to establish an independent state of urgency."<ref>{{cite book |author1=al Madfai |author2=Madiha Rashid |year=1993 |title=Jordan, the United States and the Middle East Peace Process, 1974–1991 |series=Cambridge Middle East Library |volume=28 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-41523-1 |page=21}}</ref> In November 1974, the PLO was recognized as competent on all matters concerning the question of Palestine by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] granting them [[Member states of the United Nations#Observers and non-members|observer status]] as a "non-state entity" at the UN.<ref name=GA3237>{{UN document |docid=A/RES/3237(XXIX) |body=A |type=R |session=29 |resolution_number=3237 (XXIX) |title=Observer status for the Palestine Liberation Organization |date=22 November 1974 |meeting=2296th plenary meeting |accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Isolated States: A Comparative Analysis |series=Cambridge Studies in International Relations |volume=15 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isolatedstatesco0000geld/page/155 155] |author=Geldenhuys, Deon |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-521-40268-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/isolatedstatesco0000geld/page/155 }}</ref> After the 1988 Declaration of Independence, the UN General Assembly officially acknowledged the proclamation and decided to use the designation "Palestine" instead of "Palestine Liberation Organization" in the UN.<ref name=GA43177>{{UN document |docid=A/RES/43/117 |body=A |type=R |session=43 |resolution_number=43/117 |title=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |date=8 December 1988 |meeting=75th plenary meeting |accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Tim |last1=Hillier |title=Sourcebook on Public International Law |date=1998 |isbn=978-1-84314-380-2 |access-date=8 June 2014 |url={{Google books |id=ukWq9mMUeesC |page=205 |plainurl=yes }} |pages=205 |publisher=Cavendish Publishing |edition=Cavendish Publishing sourcebook series}}</ref> In spite of this decision, the PLO did not participate at the UN in its capacity of the State of Palestine's government.<ref>{{UN document |docid=A/55/PV.54 |body=A |type=A |session=55 |document_number=36 |title=Bethlehem 2000 Draft resolution (A/55/L.3) |page=10 |meeting=54th plenary meeting |date=7 November 2000 |meetingtime=3 p.m. |speakername=[[Nasser al-Qudwa|Al-Kidwa, Nasser]] |speakernation=State of Palestine{{!}}Palestine|language=Arabic |accessdate=10 June 2014}} "Moreover, we are confident that in the near future we will truly be able to join the international community, represented in the Organization as Palestine, the State that encompasses Bethlehem."</ref>

In 1979, through the [[Camp David Accords]], Egypt signaled an end to any claim of its own over the Gaza Strip. In July 1988, Jordan [[Jordan's disengagement from the West Bank|ceded its claims to the West Bank]]—with the exception of guardianship over [[Haram al-Sharif]]—to the PLO. In November 1988, the PLO legislature, while in exile, declared the establishment of the "State of Palestine". In the month following, it was quickly recognised by many states, including Egypt and Jordan. In the Palestinian Declaration of Independence, the State of Palestine is described as being established on the "Palestinian territory", without explicitly specifying further. Because of this, some of the countries that recognised the State of Palestine in their statements of recognition refer to the "1967 borders", thus recognizing as its territory only the [[Palestinian territories|occupied Palestinian territory]], and not Israel. The UN membership application submitted by the State of Palestine also specified that it is based on the "1967 borders".<ref name=only1967 /> During the negotiations of the Oslo Accords, the PLO recognised Israel's right to exist, and Israel recognised the PLO as representative of the Palestinian people. Between 1993 and 1998, the PLO made commitments to change the provisions of its Palestinian National Charter that are inconsistent with the aim for a two-state solution and peaceful coexistence with Israel.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

After Israel took control of the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza Strip from Egypt, it began to establish [[Israeli settlement]]s there. These were organised into [[Judea and Samaria Area|Judea and Samaria district]] (West Bank) and [[Hof Aza Regional Council]] (Gaza Strip) in the [[Southern District (Israel)|Southern District]]. Administration of the Arab population of these territories was performed by the [[Israeli Civil Administration]] of the [[Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories]] and by local [[Municipality (Palestinian Authority)|municipal councils]] present since before the Israeli takeover. In 1980, Israel decided to freeze elections for these councils and to establish instead Village Leagues, whose officials were under Israeli influence. Later this model became ineffective for both Israel and the Palestinians, and the Village Leagues began to break up, with the last being the Hebron League, dissolved in February 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arij.org/atlas40/chapter2.3.html|title=40 Years Of Israeli Occupation|work=arij.org|access-date=19 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718173049/http://www.arij.org/atlas40/chapter2.3.html|archive-date=18 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1993, in the [[Oslo Accords]], [[Israel]] acknowledged the PLO negotiating team as "representing the Palestinian people", in return for the PLO recognizing Israel's right to exist in peace, acceptance of [[UN Security Council resolution]]s [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|242]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|338]], and its rejection of "violence and terrorism".<ref>{{cite web|first1=Kim |last1=Murphy |title=Israel and PLO, in Historic Bid for Peace, Agree to Mutual Recognition : Mideast: After decades of conflict, accord underscores both sides' readiness to coexist.

As envisioned in the Oslo Accords, Israel allowed the PLO to establish interim administrative institutions in the Palestinian territories, which came in the form of the PNA. It was given civilian control in [[Administrative divisions of the Oslo Accords|Area B]] and civilian and security control in Area A, and remained without involvement in [[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]]. In 2005, following the implementation of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan, the PNA gained full control of the Gaza Strip with the exception of its borders, airspace, and [[territorial waters]].{{ref label|control|iii|}} Following the [[Fatah–Hamas conflict|inter-Palestinian conflict]] in 2006, [[Hamas]] took over control of the Gaza Strip (it already had majority in the PLC), and [[Fatah]] took control of the West Bank.

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of the State of Palestine}}
The [[Palestinian territories|areas claimed by the State of Palestine]] lie in the [[Levant]]. The [[Gaza Strip]] borders the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the west, Egypt to the south, and Israel to the north and east. The [[West Bank]] is bordered by [[Jordan]] to the east, and Israel to the north, south, and west. Thus, the two enclaves constituting the area claimed by State of Palestine have no geographical border with one another, being separated by [[Israel]]. These areas would constitute the world's 163rd largest country by land area.<ref name="auto" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.un.org/CountryProfile.aspx/_Images/CountryProfile.aspx?crName=State+of+Palestine|title=UNdata &#124; country profile &#124; State of Palestine|website=data.un.org}}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/state-of-palestine-population/|title=State of Palestine Population (2020) – Worldometer|website=www.worldometers.info}}</ref>

Palestine has a number of environmental issues; issues facing the Gaza Strip include [[desertification]]; [[Biosalinity|salination]] of fresh water; [[sewage treatment]]; [[water-borne disease]]s; [[soil degradation]]; and depletion and contamination of underground water resources. In the West Bank, many of the same issues apply; although fresh water is much more plentiful, access is restricted by the ongoing [[Palestinian territories#Political status and sovereignty|dispute]].<ref name="al Haq">{{Cite web|url=http://www.alhaq.org/search|title=Search|website=www.alhaq.org}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Temperatures in Palestine vary widely. The climate in the West Bank is mostly [[Mediterranean]], slightly cooler at elevated areas compared with the shoreline, west to the area. In the east, the West Bank includes much of the Judean Desert including the western shoreline of the Dead Sea, characterised by dry and hot climate. Gaza has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: BSh) with mild winters and dry hot summers.<ref name="GS">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/palestine/gaza.htm |title=Gaza |publisher=Global Security |access-date=25 January 2009}}</ref> Spring arrives around March–April and the hottest months are July and August, with the average high being {{convert|33|°C|°F|0|sp=us}}.

These should be distinguished from the [[President of the Palestinian National Authority]], [[Palestinian Legislative Council]] (PLC) and [[Palestinian government of June 2007|PNA Cabinet]], all of which are instead associated with the [[Palestinian National Authority]].

The State of Palestine's founding document is the Palestinian Declaration of Independence,<ref name=declaration1988 /> and it should be distinguished from the unrelated PLO [[Palestinian National Covenant]] and PNA [[Palestine Basic Law]].

East Jerusalem (comprising the small pre-1967 Jordanian eastern-sector Jerusalem municipality together with a significant area of the pre-1967 West Bank demarcated by Israel in 1967) is administered as part of the [[Jerusalem District]] of Israel, but is claimed by Palestine as part of the [[Jerusalem Governorate]].

=== Foreign relations ===
{{See also|Foreign relations of Palestine|List of diplomatic missions of Palestine|List of diplomatic missions to Palestine}}
Representation of the State of Palestine is performed by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO). In states that recognise the State of Palestine it maintains [[Embassy|embassies]]. The Palestine Liberation Organization is represented in various international organizations as member, associate or observer. Because of inconclusiveness in sources in some cases it is impossible to distinguish whether the participation is executed by the PLO as representative of the State of Palestine, by the PLO as a non-state entity or by the PNA.{{cn|date=November 2019}}

On 3 October 2014, new [[Sweden|Swedish]] Prime Minister [[Stefan Löfven]] used his inaugural address in parliament to announce that Sweden would recognise the state of Palestine. The official decision to do so was made on 30 October, making Sweden the first EU member state outside of the former communist bloc to recognise the state of Palestine. Most of the EU's 28 member states have refrained from recognising Palestinian statehood and those that do—such as Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia—did so before accession.<ref>{{cite news |last= Beaumont |first= Peter |date= 3 October 2014 |title= Sweden to recognise state of Palestine |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/sweden-recognise-state-palestine |newspaper= The Guardian |location= London |access-date= 14 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015010203/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/03/sweden-recognise-state-palestine |archive-date= 15 October 2014 |url-status=live |df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date= 30 October 2014 |title= Sweden officially recognises state of Palestine |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/sweden-officially-recognises-state-palestine |newspaper= The Guardian |access-date= 31 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030183646/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/30/sweden-officially-recognises-state-palestine |archive-date= 30 October 2014 |url-status=live |df= dmy-all }}</ref><ref><!-- The citation by the government -->{{cite news | last= Wallström, Minister for Foreign Affairs | first= Margot | date= 30 October 2014 | title= Sweden today decides to recognise the State of Palestine |url=http://www.dn.se/debatt/sweden-today-decides-to-recognise-the-state-of-palestine/ | newspaper= Dagens Nyheter | location= Stockholm | access-date= 21 April 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416080150/http://www.dn.se/debatt/sweden-today-decides-to-recognise-the-state-of-palestine/ | archive-date= 16 April 2015 | url-status=live | df= dmy-all }}</ref>

However, the UK government is not bound to do anything as a result of the vote: its current policy is that it "reserves the right to recognise a Palestinian state bilaterally at the moment of our choosing and when it can best help bring about peace".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29596822 |title=MPs back Palestinian statehood alongside Israel |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=14 October 2014 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |access-date=14 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014081040/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-29596822 |archive-date=14 October 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Generally, the water quality is considerably worse in the [[Gaza strip]] when compared to the [[West Bank]]. About a third to half of the delivered water in the Palestinian territories is [[Non-revenue water|lost in the distribution network]]. The lasting blockade of the Gaza Strip and the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] have caused severe damage to the infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.<ref name="UN Gaza">{{cite web

|{{note|naming}}Note that the name [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] can commonly be interpreted as the entire territory of the former [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]], which today also incorporates Israel.

Like Pharaoh before him, Herod, having been frustrated in his original efforts, now seeks to achieve his objectives by implementing a program of infanticide. As a result, here—as in Exodus—rescuing the hero's life from the clutches of the evil king necessitates a sudden flight to another country. And finally, in perhaps the most vivid parallel of all, the present narrative uses virtually the same words of the earlier one to provide the information that the coast is clear for the herds safe return: here, in Matthew 2:20, "go [back]… for those who sought the Childs life are dead; there, in Exodus 4:19, go back… for all the men who sought your life are dead."}}
