'''Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk''' ({{lang-uk|Леонід Макарович Кравчук}}; born 10 January 1934) is a former [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] politician and the [[President of Ukraine#List of Presidents of Ukraine|first President of Ukraine]], who served from 5 December 1991, until his resignation on 19 July 1994. He is also a former [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada]] and People's Deputy of Ukraine serving in the [[Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united)]] faction.

After a political crisis involving the President and the Prime Minister, Kravchuk resigned from the Presidency, but ran for a [[1994 Ukrainian presidential election|second term as President in 1994]]. He was defeated by his former [[Prime Minister]], [[Leonid Kuchma]], who served as President for two terms. After Kravchuk's presidency, he was active in Ukrainian politics, serving as a People's Deputy of Ukraine in the Verkhovna Rada and the leader of [[Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united)]]'s parliamentary group (from 2002 to 2006). He is currently retired from politics.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kravchuk Not To Run For Snap Rada Elections|url=http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/158415.html|publisher=ukranews.com|date=25 October 2008|accessdate=29 December 2008|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130205031829/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/158415.html|archive-date=5 February 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

At the age of {{age|1934|1|10}}, he is the oldest living former Ukrainian president.

==Biography==
{{one source|section|date=January 2017}}
Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk was born in 1934 in the village of Velykyi Zhytyn (''Żytyń Wielki'') to a peasant family. At that time the village was located in Aleksandrija gmina, Rowno powiat in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. The village became part of [[Rivne Oblast]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] after the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet invasion]] in 1939 when Kravchuk was a child. His father served in the Polish cavalry in the 1930s, and later he and his wife worked for the local [[osadnik]]s (Polish colonists). During [[World War II]] Kravchuk's father perished on the front lines.

Kravchuk married a mathematics teacher, Antonina Mykhailivna Mishura, in 1957.<ref name=UKPresWifes/><ref name=AntoninaBB>{{cite book |title=Barbara Bush: A Memoir|last=Bush|first=Barbara|authorlink=Barbara Bush|year=1994|publisher=Scribner|location=New York |isbn= 0-7432-5447-3|page=428|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0qdrPsi0eEC&q=Antonina+Kravchuk&pg=PA428|accessdate=13 June 2014}}</ref> [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1989–93, [[Barbara Bush]] (wife of the [[List of Presidents of the United States|41st]] [[President of the United States]] [[George H. W. Bush]]), described Antonina in her memoirs: "She was the nicest young woman, a math teacher with absolutely no interest in politics".<ref name=AntoninaBB/>

Kravchuk joined the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] in 1958 and rose through the ranks of the party and of its ''[[agitprop]]'' department. He became a member of the Ukrainian [[Communist Party Bureau]] in 1989, and on 23 July 1990, became [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada|Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR]], becoming the republic's nominal head of state.

After the 19–21 August [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991 Soviet coup attempt]] Kravchuk resigned from the Communist Party.  After the Verkhovna Rada passed the [[Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]] on 24 August, the constitution was amended to create the post of [[President of Ukraine]]. Before the vote for the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine Kravchuk was instrumental in persuading the communists parliamentary majority to accept the opposition’s demands of Ukrainian Independence.<ref>[https://ukrainianweek.com/History/222470 A reform that ruined the Soviet Union], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (10 November 2018)</ref> Following the Act of Declaration of Independence Kravchuk was vested with presidential powers, thus becoming both de facto and de jure head of state. Later that year, on 5 December 1991, voters formally elected him president in Ukraine's [[1991 Ukrainian presidential election|first presidential election]]. On the same day, the voters [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|voted overwhelmingly]] to secede from the Soviet Union—a move which Kravchuk now fully supported. This made Kravchuk the first head of state of independent Ukraine.

==Political portrait==
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2017}}
Leonid Kravchuk's political creed is avoiding conflicts and straightforward declaration of his position. He is widely considered to be cunning, diplomatic, and cautious. He describes himself as a man who refuses to take an umbrella because he hopes to "slip between the raindrops." (in interview by Yulia Lytvynenko at ''Poza ochi'' on [[Inter (TV channel)|Inter]] (Ukraine), 2009)

Such diplomacy helped Kravchuk to retain and strengthen his power over [[Ukraine]] during the transition from Soviet rule to independence. He was third in command in Ukraine's [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] leadership before the fall of Soviet Union even though he didn't belong to the ruling [[Dnipropetrovsk]] group. He avoided inflexible positions towards democratic changes and was a compromise figure for both party [[Conservatism|conservatives]] and [[reformist]]s.

Soon after his defeat in 1994, Kravchuk joined the powerful business and political group known as Kyiv Holding or the Dynamo Group. This group, led by [[Ukrainian oligarchs|oligarchs]] [[Viktor Medvedchuk]] and [[Hryhoriy Surkis]], is formally organized as the [[Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united)]]. Despite its formal centrist/[[social-democratic]] slogans, the party is widely associated with big business, [[organized crime]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} [[political corruption|corruption]], and media bias in favor of former President Kuchma.

In 2004, Surkis was banned from visiting the [[United States]], due to his alleged involvement in irregularities during the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]]. The group also took a strongly [[Russophilia|pro-Russian]] and anti-Western stand. Analysts say that TV channels and other media controlled by the group have started a sharp anti-U.S./anti-[[NATO]] campaign. Kravchuk has been highly criticized for remaining one of the leaders of SDPU(o), specializing in negotiations and [[public relations]], despite his declared pro-democratic and patriotic position.

During the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|2004 presidential elections]] Kravchuk actively supported the candidacy of [[Viktor Yanukovych]]<ref name=Viktor>[http://www.pravda.com.ua/en/news/2007/6/27/8200.htm Viktor Medvedchuk’s Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906150954/http://www.pravda.com.ua/en/news/2007/6/27/8200.htm |date=2008-09-06 }}, [[Ukrainska Pravda]] (26 June 2007).</ref> and was a member of the Yanukovych team that negotiated with the opposition in the aftermath of that disputed election.<ref name=team>[http://www.nrcu.gov.ua/index.php?id=148&listid=7854 Leonid Kravchuk says, Viktor Yanukovych is not against talks with Yuschenko] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204224738/http://nrcu.gov.ua/index.php?id=148&listid=7854 |date=2010-12-04 }}, [[Radio Ukraine]] (29 November 2004).</ref> In November 2004 he told the media that he was afraid that the resulting crisis would cause the disintegration of the country, intensifying movements for certain regions of Ukraine to join other countries.

On 25 September 2009, Kravchuk declared during an interview with the newspaper ''Den'' that he left the Social-Democratic Party (United) and became unaffiliated again. He explained this based on the fact that his former party decided to join the [[election bloc of left and central left political forces]] to run for the [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election|2010 presidential elections]]. He was indignant due to the fact that the political council of the party decided to accomplish that behind the closed doors in non-democratic order. He called the "block as the artificial union without any perspectives".<ref>[http://5.ua/newsline/239//62265/ Kravchuk left SDP], 5.ua; accessed 3 January 2017. {{in lang|uk}}</ref><ref>[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/20944 Kravchuk leaves Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united)], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (25 September 2009).</ref> Kravchuk [[Political endorsement|endorsed]] [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] during the 2010 presidential elections campaign.<ref name=Yulia>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.focus.ua/politics/73223 Кравчук стал доверенным лицом Тимошенко на президентских выборах] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723005745/http://focus.ua/politics/73223 |date=2012-07-23 }}, [[Focus (Ukrainian magazine)|Focus]] (21 October 2009).</ref>

During the 2010 election campaign he accused incumbent President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] of having "turned into Yanukovych's aide. He has actually turned into an also-ran. His task is to slander Yulia Tymoshenko every day and prevent her from winning [the presidential elections]".<ref>[[Interfax-Ukraine]] (27 October 2009).</ref> Kravchuk explained his shift in support from Yanukovych to Tymoshenko was caused because he felt Yanukovych "turned his back" on all the issues Kravchuk wanted him to address as president: the [[Ukrainian language]], [[Ukrainian culture|culture]] and the [[Holodomor]]. "Only the dead or the stupid do not change their views", he stated in December 2009 when he also voiced the opinion that voting for Yanukovych in the second round of the 2010 elections would indicate an [[anti-Ukrainian]] position.<ref>[http://zik.com.ua/en/news/2009/12/21/209493 Kravchuk explains his drift to Tymoshenko] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714201445/http://zik.com.ua/en/news/2009/12/21/209493 |date=2014-07-14 }}, zik.com.ua (21 December 2009).</ref>

{{BLP sources section|date=January 2017}}

===Economy===
During Kravchuk's leadership the government of Ukraine's economic policy was often criticized. He failed to avoid [[political corruption|corruption]] in the [[privatization]] of the country's industry and promote effective [[financial]] decisions. Ukrainian annual [[inflation]] rates from 1992 to 1994 reached thousands of percents. Millions of loans given by the semi-government banks defaulted. This led to delays of many years in salaries for industry workers, teachers, etc. The collapse of the [[Black Sea]] Steamship Company became the saddest symbol of the Kravchuk era. This global merchant fleet, the largest in the world (based mostly in [[Odessa]]), was covertly sold out to foreign companies, mostly for fake debts. Hundreds of sailors who had not received their salaries were trapped for years on board their vessels throughout the world. Kravchuk's own son was later accused of taking part in this [[fraud]].

Shocked by these developments and also by [[Russia–Ukraine relations|growing tensions with Russia]], the voters of industrial and predominantly [[Russian language|Russian]]-speaking southeastern Ukraine supported Kravchuk's main rival, [[Leonid Kuchma]], in the 1994 presidential elections. Kuchma won under the [[slogan]]s of fighting corruption, reconstruction of the economy, and further integration with Russia. Kravchuk's reliance on bureaucratic pressure, support of pro-Western [[nationalist]]s, and [[media bias]] did not serve him well.

===Administrative reform===
On 25 February 1992, the President of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, issued the Presidential decree 98/92 ''About the changes in the system of central bodies of executive power of Ukraine''.<ref>[http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=98%2F92 Presidential decree 98/92], rada.gov.ua; accessed 3 January 2017.</ref>

===Foreign policy===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:RIAN archive 848095 Signing the Agreement to eliminate the USSR and establish the Commonwealth of Independent States.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and [[President of the Russian Federation]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolving the Soviet Union]], 8 December 1991]]
After becoming president of independent Ukraine, Kravchuk achieved and strengthened formal [[sovereignty]] of the country and developed its relations with the West. The Kravchuk administration walked a tight rope between escalation of [[Russia–Ukraine relations|Ukrainian–Russian tensions]] and a policy of cooperation with Moscow. Brinkmanship with Russia in matters of post-Soviet settlement (most notably the fate of nuclear weapons and the Black Sea fleet) was often accompanied by speculation about Ukraine's imminent departure from the Commonwealth of Independent States.

He refused to retain the common [[armed forces]] and [[currency]] inside the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Rather than NATO expansion, Kravchuk wanted Ukraine's participation on an equal footing with the Central European countries, Russia and NATO in building a new, inclusive security architecture for Europe. According to the 'Guidelines for Ukraine's Foreign Policy', approved by parliament on 2 July 1993, 'Ukraine advocates the creation of an all-embracing international system of universal and all-European security and considers participation [therein] a basic component of its national security'.

The status of the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]]'s presence in [[Sevastopol]] and the Crimea was not resolved by a 20-year lease agreement until 1997, three years after Kravchuk left office. Another of his stands was the refusal of [[nuclear weapons]] based on Ukrainian territory. He was one of few country leaders who agreed to surrender Ukraine's nuclear arsenal.
