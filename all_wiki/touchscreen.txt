A '''touchscreen''', or '''touch screen''', is both an input and output device and normally layered on the top of an electronic visual display of an [[Information processor|information processing system]]. The display is often an [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] or [[OLED]] display while the system is usually a laptop, [[Tablet computer|tablet]], or smartphone. A user can give input or control the information processing system through simple or [[multi-touch]] gestures by touching the screen with a special [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]] or one or more fingers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=Geoff|title=A review of technologies for sensing contact location on the surface of a display|journal=Journal of the Society for Information Display|date=August 2012|volume=20|issue=8|pages=413–440|doi=10.1002/jsid.100|s2cid=40545665|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f78ac912afeb0a465332a388070a3866e135b5b2}}</ref> Some touchscreens use ordinary or specially coated gloves to work while others may only work using a special stylus or pen. The user can use the touchscreen to react to what is displayed and, if the software allows, to control how it is displayed; for example, [[Zooming user interface|zooming]] to increase the text size.

The touchscreen enables the user to interact directly with what is displayed, rather than using a [[computer mouse|mouse]], [[touchpad]], or other such devices (other than a stylus, which is optional for most modern touchscreens).<ref>{{Cite web|title=What is a Touch Screen?|url=https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/toucscre.htm|access-date=2020-09-07|website=www.computerhope.com|language=en}}</ref>

Touchscreens are common in devices such as [[game consoles]], [[personal computer]]s, [[electronic voting machine]]s, and [[point of sale|point-of-sale]] (POS) systems. They can also be attached to computers or, as terminals, to networks. They play a prominent role in the design of digital appliances such as [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs) and some [[e-reader]]s. Touchscreens are also important in educational settings such as classrooms or on college campuses.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Allvin|first=Rhian Evans|journal=YC Young Children|issn=1538-6619|date=2014-09-01|volume=69|issue=4|page=62|title=Technology in the Early Childhood Classroom}}</ref>

The popularity of smartphones, tablets, and many types of [[information appliance]]s is driving the demand and acceptance of common touchscreens for portable and functional electronics. Touchscreens are found in the medical field, [[heavy industry]], [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs), and kiosks such as museum displays or [[room automation]], where [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] systems do not allow a suitably intuitive, rapid, or accurate interaction by the user with the display's content.

Historically, the touchscreen sensor and its accompanying controller-based [[firmware]] have been made available by a wide array of after-market [[system integrator]]s, and not by display, chip, or [[motherboard]] manufacturers. Display manufacturers and chip manufacturers have acknowledged the trend toward acceptance of touchscreens as a [[user interface]] component and have begun to integrate touchscreens into the fundamental design of their products.

In 1972, a group at the [[University of Illinois]] filed for a patent on an optical touchscreen<ref>F. Ebeling, R. Johnson, R. Goldhor, Infrared light beam x-y position encoder for display devices, {{patent|US|3775560}}, granted November 27, 1973.</ref> that became a standard part of the [[Magnavox]] Plato IV Student Terminal and thousands were built for this purpose. These touchscreens had a crossed array of 16×16 [[infrared]] position sensors, each composed of an [[LED]] on one edge of the screen and a matched [[phototransistor]] on the other edge, all mounted in front of a monochrome [[plasma display]] panel. This arrangement could sense any fingertip-sized opaque object in close proximity to the screen. A similar touchscreen was used on the [[HP-150]] starting in 1983.

Touch-sensitive control-display units (CDUs) were evaluated for commercial aircraft flight decks in the early 1980s. Initial research showed that a touch interface would reduce pilot workload as the crew could then select waypoints, functions and actions, rather than be "head down" typing latitudes, longitudes, and waypoint codes on a keyboard. An effective integration of this technology was aimed at helping flight crews maintain a high level of situational awareness of all major aspects of the vehicle operations including the flight path, the functioning of various aircraft systems, and moment-to-moment human interactions.<ref>Biferno, M.A., Stanley, D.L.

In the early 1980s, [[General Motors]] tasked its [[Delco Electronics]] division with a project aimed at replacing an automobile's non-essential functions (i.e. other than [[throttle]], [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], [[Brake|braking]], and [[steering]]) from mechanical or electro-mechanical systems with [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] alternatives wherever possible. The finished device was dubbed the ECC for "Electronic Control Center", a [[digital computer]] and [[software]] control system hardwired to various [[peripheral]] [[sensors]], [[servos]], [[solenoids]], [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] and a [[monochrome]] CRT touchscreen that functioned both as display and sole method of input.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/1986,_Electronics_Developed_for_Lotus_Active_Suspension_Technology|title=1986, Electronics Developed for Lotus Active Suspension Technology - Generations of GM|publisher=History.gmheritagecenter.com|access-date=2013-01-07|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617155548/http://history.gmheritagecenter.com/wiki/index.php/1986,_Electronics_Developed_for_Lotus_Active_Suspension_Technology|archive-date=2013-06-17}}</ref> The ECC replaced the traditional mechanical [[Vehicle audio|stereo]], fan, heater and [[automobile air conditioning|air conditioner]] controls and displays, and was capable of providing very detailed and specific information about the vehicle's cumulative and current operating status in [[real-time computer graphics|real time]].

[[Multi-touch]] technology began in 1982, when the [[University of Toronto]]'s Input Research Group developed the first human-input multi-touch system, using a frosted-glass panel with a camera placed behind the glass. In 1985, the University of Toronto group, including Bill Buxton, developed a multi-touch tablet that used capacitance rather than bulky camera-based optical sensing systems (see [[Multi-touch#History of multi-touch|History of multi-touch]]).

In 1987, Casio launched the [[Casio PB-1000]] pocket computer with a touchscreen consisting of a 4×4 matrix, resulting in 16 touch areas in its small LCD graphic screen.

Touchscreens had a bad reputation of being imprecise until 1988. Most user-interface books would state that touchscreen selections were limited to targets larger than the average finger. At the time, selections were done in such a way that a target was selected as soon as the finger came over it, and the corresponding action was performed immediately. Errors were common, due to parallax or calibration problems, leading to user frustration.

As users touch the screen, feedback is provided as to what will be selected: users can adjust the position of the finger, and the action takes place only when the finger is lifted off the screen. This allowed the selection of small targets, down to a single pixel on a 640×480 [[Video Graphics Array]] (VGA) screen (a standard of that time).

==Technologies==
There are a variety of touchscreen technologies with different methods of sensing touch.<ref name=Sears1990/>

===Resistive===
{{Main|Resistive touchscreen}}
A [[resistive]] touchscreen panel comprises several thin layers, the most important of which are two transparent electrically resistive layers facing each other with a thin gap between. The top layer (that which is touched) has a coating on the underside surface; just beneath it is a similar resistive layer on top of its substrate. One layer has conductive connections along its sides, the other along top and bottom. A voltage is applied to one layer and sensed by the other. When an object, such as a fingertip or stylus tip, presses down onto the outer surface, the two layers touch to become connected at that point.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What is touch screen? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url=https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/touch-screen|access-date=2020-09-07|website=WhatIs.com|language=en}}</ref> The panel then behaves as a pair of [[voltage divider]]s, one axis at a time. By rapidly switching between each layer, the position of pressure on the screen can be detected.

Resistive touch is used in restaurants, factories and hospitals due to its high tolerance for liquids and contaminants. A major benefit of resistive-touch technology is its low cost. Additionally, as only sufficient pressure is necessary for the touch to be sensed, they may be used with gloves on, or by using anything rigid as a finger substitute. Disadvantages include the need to press down, and a risk of damage by sharp objects. Resistive touchscreens also suffer from poorer contrast, due to having additional reflections (i.e. glare) from the layers of material placed over the screen.<ref>Lancet, Yaara.

===Surface acoustic wave===
{{Main|Surface acoustic wave}}

Surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology uses [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] waves that pass over the touchscreen panel. When the panel is touched, a portion of the wave is absorbed. The change in ultrasonic waves is processed by the [[controller (computing)|controller]] to determine the position of the touch event. Surface acoustic wave touchscreen panels can be damaged by outside elements. Contaminants on the surface can also interfere with the functionality of the touchscreen.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Seetoo|first1=Dustin|title=How Does Touch Screen Technology Work?|url=https://premioinc.com/blog/infographic-popular-touch-screen-technologies/|website=Premio|publisher=Premio|access-date=18 August 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818220727/https://premioinc.com/blog/infographic-popular-touch-screen-technologies/|archive-date=2017-08-18}}</ref>

A capacitive touchscreen panel consists of an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]], such as [[glass]], coated with a transparent [[electrical conductor|conductor]], such as [[indium tin oxide]] (ITO).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Index-matched indium tin oxide electrodes for capacitive touch screen panel applications.|pmid=24245328|volume=13|issue=11|journal=J Nanosci Nanotechnol|pages=7756–9|last1=Hong|first1=CH|last2=Shin|first2=JH|last3=Ju|first3=BK|last4=Kim|first4=KH|last5=Park|first5=NM|last6=Kim|first6=BS|last7=Cheong|first7=WS|doi=10.1166/jnn.2013.7814|year=2013|s2cid=24281861|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/da182f47d0b80cdda454ceb714c1c4185df71843}}</ref> As the human body is also an electrical conductor, touching the surface of the screen results in a distortion of the screen's [[electrostatic]] field, measurable as a change in [[capacitance]]. Different technologies may be used to determine the location of the touch. The location is then sent to the controller for processing. Touchscreens that use silver instead of ITO exist, as ITO causes several environmental problems due to the use of indium.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fujifilm.eu/eu/news/article/fujifilm-reinforces-the-production-facilities-for-its-touch-panel-sensor-film-exclear|title=Fujifilm reinforces the production facilities for its touch-panel sensor film "EXCLEAR"|website=FUJIFILM Europe}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fujifilm.com/about/research/report/062/pdf/index/ff_rd062_008_en.pdf |title=Development of a Thin Double-sided Sensor Film "EXCLEAR" for Touch Panels via Silver Halide Photographic Technology |publisher=www.fujifilm.com |access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://fujifilm-innovation.tumblr.com/post/142053562369/whats-behind-your-smartphone-screen-this|title=What's behind your smartphone screen?

Unlike a [[resistive touchscreen]], some capacitive touchscreens cannot be used to detect a finger through electrically insulating material, such as gloves. This disadvantage especially affects usability in consumer electronics, such as touch tablet PCs and capacitive smartphones in cold weather when people may be wearing gloves. It can be overcome with a special capacitive stylus, or a special-application glove with an embroidered patch of conductive thread allowing electrical contact with the user's fingertip.

A low-quality [[switching-mode power supply]] unit with an accordingly unstable, noisy [[voltage]] may temporarily interfere with the precision, accuracy and sensitivity of capacitive touch screens.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Andi|date=2014-01-24|title=How noise affects touch screens|url=https://www.westfloridacomponents.com/blog/noise-affects-touch-screens/|access-date=2020-10-24|website=West Florida Components|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Touch screens and charger noise {{!}} |url=https://www.epanorama.net/blog/2013/03/12/touch-screens-and-charger-noise/ |website=epanorama.net |date=2013-03-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Aggressively combat noise in capacitive touch applications |url=https://www.edn.com/aggressively-combat-noise-in-capacitive-touch-applications/ |website=EDN.com |date=2013-04-08}}</ref>

Some capacitive display manufacturers continue to develop thinner and more accurate touchscreens. Those for [[mobile device]]s are now being produced with 'in-cell' technology, such as in Samsung's [[AMOLED#Super AMOLED|Super AMOLED]] screens, that eliminates a layer by building the capacitors inside the display itself. This type of touchscreen reduces the visible distance between the user's finger and what the user is touching on the screen, reducing the thickness and weight of the display, which is desirable in [[smartphone]]s.

A simple parallel-plate capacitor has two conductors separated by a dielectric layer. Most of the energy in this system is concentrated directly between the plates. Some of the energy spills over into the area outside the plates, and the electric field lines associated with this effect are called fringing fields. Part of the challenge of making a practical capacitive sensor is to design a set of printed circuit traces which direct fringing fields into an active sensing area accessible to a user. A parallel-plate capacitor is not a good choice for such a sensor pattern. Placing a finger near fringing electric fields adds conductive surface area to the capacitive system. The additional charge storage capacity added by the finger is known as finger capacitance, or CF. The capacitance of the sensor without a finger present is known as parasitic capacitance, or CP.

====Surface capacitance====
In this basic technology, only one side of the insulator is coated with a conductive layer. A small voltage is applied to the layer, resulting in a uniform electrostatic field. When a conductor, such as a human finger, touches the uncoated surface, a capacitor is dynamically formed. The sensor's controller can determine the location of the touch indirectly from the change in the capacitance as measured from the four corners of the panel. As it has no moving parts, it is moderately durable but has limited resolution, is prone to false signals from parasitic [[capacitive coupling]], and needs [[calibration]] during manufacture. It is therefore most often used in simple applications such as industrial controls and [[interactive kiosk|kiosks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electronicdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&ArticleID=18592|title=Please Touch! Explore The Evolving World Of Touchscreen Technology|publisher=electronicdesign.com|access-date=2009-09-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213043947/http://electronicdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&ArticleID=18592|archive-date=2015-12-13}}</ref>

Although some standard capacitance detection methods are projective, in the sense that they can be used to detect a finger through a non-conductive surface, they are very sensitive to fluctuations in temperature, which expand or contract the sensing plates, causing fluctuations in the capacitance of these plates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/capacitor/cap_4.html|title=formula for relationship between plate area and capacitance}}</ref> These fluctuations result in a lot of background noise, so a strong finger signal is required for accurate detection. This limits applications to those where the finger directly touches the sensing element or is sensed through a relatively thin non-conductive surface.

====Projected capacitance====
[[File:PCT Globe.jpg|thumb|Back side of a Multitouch Globe, based on projected capacitive touch (PCT) technology]]
[[File:8x8wire touchscreen.jpg|thumb|8 x 8 projected capacitance touchscreen manufactured using 25 micron insulation coated copper wire embedded in a clear polyester film.]]
[[File:TouchScreen projective capacitive.svg|thumb|Schema of projected-capacitive touchscreen]]
Projected capacitive touch (PCT; also PCAP) technology is a variant of capacitive touch technology but where sensitivity to touch, accuracy, resolution and speed of touch have been greatly improved by the use of a simple form of 
"Artificial Intelligence".  This intelligent processing enables finger sensing to be projected, accurately and reliably, through very thick glass and even double glazing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/patents/EP0185671B1|title=Touch operated keyboard|access-date=2018-01-30|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131150533/https://www.google.co.uk/patents/EP0185671B1|archive-date=2018-01-31}}</ref>
  
Some modern PCT touch screens are composed of thousands of discrete keys,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US7663607B2/en|title=Multipoint touchscreen}}</ref> but most PCT touch screens are made of a matrix of rows and columns of conductive material, layered on sheets of glass.
This can be done either by [[etching (microfabrication)|etching]] a single conductive layer to form a grid pattern of [[electrode]]s, or by etching two separate, perpendicular layers of conductive material with parallel lines or tracks to form a grid. The conductive layer is often transparent, being made of [[Indium tin oxide]] (ITO), a transparent electrical conductor.
In some designs, voltage applied to this grid creates a uniform electrostatic field, which can be measured. When a conductive object, such as a finger, comes into contact with a PCT panel, it distorts the local electrostatic field at that point. This is measurable as a change in capacitance. If a finger bridges the gap between two of the "tracks", the charge field is further interrupted and detected by the controller. The capacitance can be changed and measured at every individual point on the grid. This system is able to accurately track touches.<ref>Knowledge base: [http://www.multi-touch-solution.com/en/knowledge-base-en/multitouch-technologies-en/ Multi-touch hardware] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203083820/http://www.multi-touch-solution.com/en/knowledge-base-en/multitouch-technologies-en/|date=2012-02-03}}</ref>

Due to the top layer of a PCT being glass, it is sturdier than less-expensive resistive touch technology. 
Unlike traditional capacitive touch technology, it is possible for a PCT system to sense a passive stylus or gloved finger. However, moisture on the surface of the panel, high humidity, or collected dust can interfere with performance.
These environmental factors, however, are not a problem with 'fine wire' based touchscreens due to the fact that wire based touchscreens have a much lower 'parasitic' capacitance, and there is greater distance between neighbouring conductors.

There are two types of PCT: mutual capacitance and self-capacitance.

=====Mutual capacitance=====
This is a common PCT approach, which makes use of the fact that most conductive objects are able to hold a charge if they are very close together. In mutual capacitive sensors, a capacitor is inherently formed by the row trace and column trace at each intersection of the grid. A 16×14 array, for example, would have 224 independent capacitors. A voltage is applied to the rows or columns. Bringing a finger or conductive stylus close to the surface of the sensor changes the local electrostatic field, which in turn reduces the mutual capacitance. The capacitance change at every individual point on the grid can be measured to accurately determine the touch location by measuring the voltage in the other axis. Mutual capacitance allows multi-touch operation where multiple fingers, palms or styli can be accurately tracked at the same time.

=====Self-capacitance=====
Self-capacitance sensors can have the same X-Y grid as mutual capacitance sensors, but the columns and rows operate independently. With self-capacitance, the capacitive load of a finger is measured on each column or row electrode by a current meter, or the change in frequency of an RC oscillator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://binsteaddesigns.com/electronics_weekly.jpg|title=Use of RC oscillator in touchscreen}}</ref>

A finger may be detected anywhere along the whole length of a row.   
If that finger is also detected by a column, then it can be assumed that the finger position is at the intersection of this row/column pair.
This allows for the speedy and accurate detection of a single finger, but it causes some ambiguity if more than one finger is to be detected.
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph250/lee2/docs/art6.pdf|title=Ambiguity caused by multitouch in self capacitance touchscreens }}</ref> 
Two fingers may have four possible detection positions, only two of which are true. However, by selectively de-sensitizing any touch-points in contention, conflicting results are easily eliminated. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US9035903?/en|title=Multitouch using Self Capacitance}}</ref>  This enables "Self Capacitance" to be used for multi-touch operation.

Alternatively, ambiguity can be avoided by applying a "de-sensitizing" signal to all but one of the columns .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US9035903?/en|title=Multitouch using Self Capacitance}}</ref>  
This leaves just a short section of any row sensitive to touch. By selecting a sequence of these sections along the row, it is possible to determine the accurate position of multiple fingers along that row. This process can then be repeated for all the other rows until the whole screen has been scanned. 

Self-capacitive touch screen layers are used on mobile phones such as the [[Sony Xperia Sola]]<ref name=SonyDev>[http://archive.vn/2012.03.14-110416/http://developer.sonymobile.com/wp/2012/03/13/imagine-controlling-your-phone-without-touching-the-screen-floating-touch-makes-it-possible-video/ Self-capacitive touch described on official Sony Developers blog]</ref>, the [[Samsung Galaxy S4]], [[Galaxy Note 3]], [[Galaxy S5]], and [[Galaxy Alpha]].


Self capacitance is far more sensitive than mutual capacitance and is mainly used for single touch, simple gesturing and proximity sensing where the finger does not even have to touch the glass surface.
Mutual capacitance is mainly used for multitouch applications.
<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1612/1612.08227.pdf|title=Comparison of self capacitance and mutual capacitance. |doi=10.1017/S1743921315010388 |arxiv=1612.08227 |last1=Du |first1=Li |year=2016 }}</ref>
Many touchscreen manufacturers use both self and mutual capacitance technologies in the same product, thereby combining their individual benefits.
<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cypress.com/products/cypress-sensing-technologies|title=Hybrid self and mutual capacitance touch sensing controllers }}</ref>

====Use of styli on capacitive screens====
Capacitive touchscreens do not necessarily need to be operated by a finger, but until recently the special styli required could be quite expensive to purchase. The cost of this technology has fallen greatly in recent years and capacitive styli are now widely available for a nominal charge, and often given away free with mobile accessories. These consist of an electrically conductive shaft with a soft conductive rubber tip, thereby resistively connecting the fingers to the tip of the stylus.

===Infrared grid===
[[Image:Platovterm1981.jpg|right|thumb|Infrared sensors mounted around the display watch for a user's touchscreen input on this PLATO V terminal in 1981. The monochromatic plasma display's characteristic orange glow is illustrated.]]

An [[infrared]] touchscreen uses an array of X-Y infrared [[light-emitting diode|LED]] and [[photodetector]] pairs around the edges of the screen to detect a disruption in the pattern of LED beams. These LED beams cross each other in vertical and horizontal patterns. This helps the sensors pick up the exact location of the touch. A major benefit of such a system is that it can detect essentially any opaque object including a finger, gloved finger, stylus or pen. It is generally used in outdoor applications and POS systems that cannot rely on a conductor (such as a bare finger) to activate the touchscreen. Unlike [[capacitive sensing|capacitive touchscreens]], infrared touchscreens do not require any patterning on the glass which increases durability and optical clarity of the overall system. Infrared touchscreens are sensitive to dirt and dust that can interfere with the infrared beams, and suffer from parallax in curved surfaces and accidental press when the user hovers a finger over the screen while searching for the item to be selected.

===Infrared acrylic projection===
A translucent acrylic sheet is used as a rear-projection screen to display information.  The edges of the acrylic sheet are illuminated by infrared LEDs, and infrared cameras are focused on the back of the sheet.  Objects placed on the sheet are detectable by the cameras.  When the sheet is touched by the user, the deformation results in leakage of infrared light which peaks at the points of maximum pressure, indicating the user's touch location.  Microsoft's [[Microsoft PixelSense|PixelSense]] tablets use this technology.

===Optical imaging===
Optical touchscreens are a relatively modern development in touchscreen technology, in which two or more [[image sensors]] (such as [[CMOS sensor]]s) are placed around the edges (mostly the corners) of the screen. Infrared backlights are placed in the sensor’s field of view on the opposite side of the screen. A touch blocks some lights from the sensors, and the location and size of the touching object can be calculated (see [[Visual hull#In two dimensions|visual hull]]). This technology is growing in popularity due to its scalability, versatility, and affordability for larger touchscreens.

===Dispersive signal technology===
Introduced in 2002 by [[3M]], this system detects a touch by using sensors to measure the [[piezoelectricity]] in the glass. Complex algorithms interpret this information and provide the actual location of the touch.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2009-03-16|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2008/02/13/innovation-series-touchscreen-technology.aspx|title=Innovation Series: Touchscreen Technology|work=The Motley Fool|date=2008-02-13|last=Beyers|first=Tim|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324195620/http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2008/02/13/innovation-series-touchscreen-technology.aspx|archive-date=2009-03-24}}</ref> The technology is unaffected by dust and other outside elements, including scratches. Since there is no need for additional elements on screen, it also claims to provide excellent optical clarity. Any object can be used to generate touch events, including gloved fingers. A downside is that after the initial touch, the system cannot detect a motionless finger.  However, for the same reason, resting objects do not disrupt touch recognition.

===Acoustic pulse recognition===
The key to this technology is that a touch at any one position on the surface generates a sound wave in the substrate which then produces a unique combined signal as measured by three or more tiny transducers attached to the edges of the touchscreen. The digitized signal is compared to a list corresponding to every position on the surface, determining the touch location. A moving touch is tracked by rapid repetition of this process. Extraneous and ambient sounds are ignored since they do not match any stored sound profile. The technology differs from other sound-based technologies by using a simple look-up method rather than expensive signal-processing hardware. As with the dispersive signal technology system, a motionless finger cannot be detected after the initial touch. However, for the same reason, the touch recognition is not disrupted by any resting objects. The technology was created by SoundTouch Ltd in the early 2000s, as described by the patent family EP1852772, and introduced to the market by [[Tyco International]]'s Elo division in 2006 as Acoustic Pulse Recognition.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Acoustic Pulse Recognition Touchscreens|page=3|publisher=Elo Touch Systems|year=2006|url=http://media.elotouch.com/pdfs/marcom/apr_wp.pdf|access-date=2011-09-27|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905005921/http://media.elotouch.com/pdfs/marcom/apr_wp.pdf|archive-date=2011-09-05}}</ref> The touchscreen used by Elo is made of ordinary glass, giving good durability and optical clarity. The technology usually retains accuracy with scratches and dust on the screen. The technology is also well suited to displays that are physically larger.

==Construction==
{{expand section|date=September 2017}}
There are several principal ways to build a touchscreen. The key goals are to recognize one or more fingers touching a display, to interpret the command that this represents, and to communicate the command to the appropriate application.

[[File:Lattice touchscreen.jpg|thumb|This diagram shows how eight inputs to a lattice touchscreen or keypad  creates 28 unique intersections, as opposed to 16 intersections created using a standard x/y multiplexed touchscreen .]]

In the resistive approach, which used to be the most popular technique, there are typically four layers:
# Top polyester-coated layer with a transparent metallic-conductive coating on the bottom.
# Adhesive spacer
# Glass layer coated with a transparent metallic-conductive coating on the top
# Adhesive layer on the backside of the glass for mounting.
When a user touches the surface, the system records the change in the electric current that flows through the display.

Dispersive-signal technology measures the [[piezoelectric effect]]—the voltage generated when mechanical force is applied to a material—that occurs chemically when a strengthened glass substrate is touched.

There are two infrared-based approaches. In one, an array of sensors detects a finger touching or almost touching the display, thereby interrupting infrared light beams projected over the screen. In the other, bottom-mounted [[thermographic camera|infrared cameras]] record heat from screen touches.

The x/y layout, commonly used in touchscreens, has also been improved by using a diagonal lattice layout, where there are no dedicated x or y elements, but each element may be transmitting or sensing at different times during a scan of the touchscreen. This means that there are nearly twice as many cross-over points for a fixed number of terminal connections and no 'bussed' connections around the edges of the touchscreen .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?FT=D&date=20170125&DB=&locale=en_EP&CC=GB&NR=2540560A&KC=A&ND=4|title=Espacenet - Original document|publisher=Worldwide.espacenet.com|date=2017-04-26|access-date=2018-02-22}}</ref>

In each case, the system determines the intended command based on the controls showing on the screen at the time and the location of the touch.

==Development==
The development of multi-touch screens facilitated the tracking of more than one finger on the screen; thus, operations that require more than one finger are possible. These devices also allow multiple users to interact with the touchscreen simultaneously.

With the growing use of touchscreens, the cost of touchscreen technology is routinely absorbed into the products that incorporate it and is nearly eliminated. Touchscreen technology has demonstrated reliability and is found in airplanes, automobiles, gaming consoles, machine control systems, appliances, and handheld display devices including cellphones; the touchscreen market for mobile devices was projected to produce US$5 billion by 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abiresearch.com/press/1231-Touch+Screens+in+Mobile+Devices+to+Deliver+$5+Billion+Next+Year|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075202/http://www.abiresearch.com/press/1231-Touch+Screens+in+Mobile+Devices+to+Deliver+$5+Billion+Next+Year|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-07-07|title=Touch Screens in Mobile Devices to Deliver $5 Billion Next Year &#124; Press Release|publisher=ABI Research|date=2008-09-10|access-date=2009-06-22}}</ref>{{update inline|date=September 2017}}

The ability to accurately point on the screen itself is also advancing with the emerging [[graphics tablet|graphics tablet-screen]] hybrids. [[Polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVFD) plays a major role in this innovation due its high piezoelectric properties, which allow the tablet to sense pressure, making such things as digital painting behave more like paper and pencil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fluorotherm.com/insights-into-pvdf-innovations/|title=Insights Into PVDF Innovations|date=17 August 2015|publisher=Fluorotherm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015100123/http://www.fluorotherm.com/insights-into-pvdf-innovations/|archive-date=15 October 2016}}</ref>

TapSense, announced in October 2011, allows touchscreens to distinguish what part of the hand was used for input, such as the fingertip, knuckle and fingernail. This could be used in a variety of ways, for example, to copy and paste, to capitalize letters, to activate different drawing modes, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/19/new-screen-technology-tapsense-can-distinguish-between-different-parts-of-your-hand/|title=New Screen Technology, TapSense, Can Distinguish Between Different Parts Of Your Hand|access-date=October 19, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020021807/http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/19/new-screen-technology-tapsense-can-distinguish-between-different-parts-of-your-hand/|archive-date=October 20, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=TapSense: Enhancing Finger Interaction on Touch Surfaces|url=http://www.chrisharrison.net/index.php/Research/TapSense/|access-date=28 January 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111095431/http://chrisharrison.net/index.php/Research/TapSense|archive-date=11 January 2012}}</ref>

A real practical integration between television-images and the functions of a normal modern PC could be an innovation in the near future: for example "all-live-information" on the internet about a film or the actors on video, a list of other music during a normal [[video clip]] of a song or news about a person.

==Ergonomics and usage==

===Touchscreen accuracy===
For touchscreens to be effective input devices, users must be able to accurately select targets and avoid accidental selection of adjacent targets. The design of touchscreen interfaces should reflect technical capabilities of the system, [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomics]], [[cognitive psychology]] and [[human physiology]].

Guidelines for touchscreen designs were first developed in the 1990s, based on early research and actual use of older systems, typically using infrared grids—which were highly dependent on the size of the user's fingers. These guidelines are less relevant for the bulk of modern devices which use capacitive or resistive touch technology.<ref>{{cite journal|title=ANSI/HFES 100-2007 Human Factors Engineering of Computer Workstations|journal=Human Factors & Ergonomics Society|year=2007|location=Santa Monica, CA}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Ergonomic Requirements for Office Work with Visual Display Terminals (VDTs)–Part 9: Requirements for Non-keyboard Input Devices|journal=International Organization for Standardization|year=2000|location=Geneva, Switzerland}}</ref>

From the mid-2000s, makers of [[operating systems]] for [[smartphones]] have promulgated standards, but these vary between manufacturers, and allow for significant variation in size based on technology changes, so are unsuitable from a [[Human factors and ergonomics|human factors]] perspective.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/LayoutandAppearance.html|title=iOS Human Interface Guidelines|publisher=Apple|access-date=2014-08-24|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826113309/https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/LayoutandAppearance.html|archive-date=2014-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://developer.android.com/design/style/metrics-grids.html|title=Metrics and Grids|access-date=2014-08-24|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716165521/https://developer.android.com/design/style/metrics-grids.html|archive-date=2014-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465415.aspx|title=Touch interactions for Windows|publisher=Microsoft|access-date=2014-08-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120338/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/windows/apps/hh465415.aspx|archive-date=2014-08-26}}</ref>

Much more important is the accuracy humans have in selecting targets with their finger or a pen stylus. The accuracy of user selection varies by position on the screen: users are most accurate at the center, less so at the left and right edges, and least accurate at the top edge and especially the bottom edge. The [[Circular error probable|R95]] accuracy (required radius for 95% target accuracy) varies from {{convert|7|mm|abbr=on}} in the center to {{convert|12|mm|abbr=on}} in the lower corners.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoober|first=Steven|url=http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/03/common-misconceptions-about-touch.php|title=Common Misconceptions About Touch|publisher=UXmatters|date=2013-02-18|access-date=2014-08-24|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114743/http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/03/common-misconceptions-about-touch.php|archive-date=2014-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hoober|first=Steven|url=http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/11/design-for-fingers-and-thumbs-instead-of-touch.php|title=Design for Fingers and Thumbs Instead of Touch|publisher=UXmatters|date=2013-11-11|access-date=2014-08-24|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826160836/http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/11/design-for-fingers-and-thumbs-instead-of-touch.php|archive-date=2014-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hoober|first1=Steven|last2=Shank|first2=Patti|last3=Boll|first3=Susanne|title=Making mLearning Usable: How We Use Mobile Devices|year=2014|location=Santa Rosa, CA}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Henze|first1=Niels|last2=Rukzio|first2=Enrico|last3=Boll|first3=Susanne|title=100,000,000 Taps: Analysis and Improvement of Touch Performance in the Large|journal=Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Human Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services|year=2011|location=New York}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Parhi|first=Pekka|title=Target Size Study for One-Handed Thumb Use on Small Touchscreen Devices|journal=Proceedings of MobileHCI 2006|year=2006|location=New York}}</ref> Users are subconsciously aware of this, and take more time to select targets which are smaller or at the edges or corners of the touchscreen.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Seungyons|last2=Zhai|first2=Shumin|title=The Performance of Touch Screen Soft Buttons|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|year=2009|location=New York}}</ref>

This user inaccuracy is a result of [[parallax]], visual acuity and the speed of the feedback loop between the eyes and fingers. The precision of the human finger alone is much, much higher than this, so when assistive technologies are provided—such as on-screen magnifiers—users can move their finger (once in contact with the screen) with precision as small as 0.1&nbsp;mm (0.004&nbsp;in).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bérard|first=François|title=Measuring the Linear and Rotational User Precision in Touch Pointing|journal=Proceedings of the 2012 ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces|year=2012|location=New York}}</ref>{{dubious|date=December 2017}}

===Hand position, digit used and switching===
Users of handheld and portable touchscreen devices hold them in a variety of ways, and routinely change their method of holding and selection to suit the position and type of input. There are four basic types of handheld interaction:
* Holding at least in part with both hands, tapping with a single thumb
* Holding with two hands and tapping with both thumbs
* Holding with one hand, tapping with the finger (or rarely, thumb) of another hand
* Holding the device in one hand, and tapping with the thumb from that same hand

Use rates vary widely. While two-thumb tapping is encountered rarely (1–3%) for many general interactions, it is used for 41% of typing interaction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoober|first=Steven|url=http://uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2014/09/insights-on-switching-centering-and-gestures-for-touchscreens.php|title=Insights on Switching, Centering, and Gestures for Touchscreens|publisher=UXmatters|date=2014-09-02|access-date=2014-08-24|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906044746/http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2014/09/insights-on-switching-centering-and-gestures-for-touchscreens.php|archive-date=2014-09-06}}</ref>

In addition, devices are often placed on surfaces (desks or tables) and tablets especially are used in stands. The user may point, select or gesture in these cases with their finger or thumb, and vary use of these methods.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoober|first=Steven|url=http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php|title=How Do Users Really Hold Mobile Devices?|publisher=UXmatters|date=2013-02-18|access-date=2014-08-24|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826211832/http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/02/how-do-users-really-hold-mobile-devices.php|archive-date=2014-08-26}}</ref>

===Combined with haptics===
Touchscreens are often used with [[haptic technology|haptic]] response systems. A common example of this technology is the vibratory feedback provided when a button on the touchscreen is tapped. Haptics are used to improve the user's experience with touchscreens by providing simulated tactile feedback, and can be designed to react immediately, partly countering on-screen response latency. Research from the [[University of Glasgow]] (Brewster, Chohan, and Brown, 2007; and more recently Hogan) demonstrates that touchscreen users reduce input errors (by 20%), increase input speed (by 20%), and lower their cognitive load (by 40%) when touchscreens are combined with haptics or tactile feedback. On top of this, a study conducted in 2013 by Boston College explored the effects that touchscreens haptic stimulation had on triggering psychological ownership of a product. Their research concluded that a touchscreens ability to incorporate high amounts of haptic involvement resulted in customers feeling more endowment to the products they were designing or buying. The study also reported that consumers using a touchscreen were willing to accept a higher price point for the items they were purchasing.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2013.10.003|title=Tablets, touchscreens, and touchpads: How varying touch interfaces trigger psychological ownership and endowment|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=24|issue=2|pages=226–233|year=2014|last1=Brasel|first1=S.

==="Gorilla arm"===
Extended use of gestural interfaces without the ability of the user to rest their arm is referred to as "gorilla arm".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/G/gorilla-arm.html|title=gorilla arm|publisher=Catb.org|access-date=2012-01-04|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121023718/http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/G/gorilla-arm.html|archive-date=2012-01-21}}</ref> It can result in fatigue, and even repetitive stress injury when routinely used in a work setting. Certain early pen-based interfaces required the operator to work in this position for much of the workday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gesturedesignblog.com/?page_id=19|title=Gesture Fatigue ruined light pens forever.

This phenomenon is often cited as an example of movements to be minimized by proper ergonomic design.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Unsupported touchscreens are still fairly common in applications such as [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] and data kiosks, but are not an issue as the typical user only engages for brief and widely spaced periods.<ref>{{cite journal|author=David Pogue|date=January 3, 2013|title=Why Touch Screens Will Not Take Over|journal=[[Scientific American]]|volume=308|issue=1|page=25|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0113-25|pmid=23342443}}</ref>

===Fingerprints===
[[File:IPad with extensive fingerprints and smudges.jpg|thumb|Fingerprints and smudges on an [[iPad]] ([[tablet computer]]) touchscreen]]

Touchscreens can suffer from the problem of fingerprints on the display. This can be mitigated by the use of materials with [[optical coating]]s designed to reduce the visible effects of fingerprint oils. Most modern smartphones have [[oleophobic]] coatings, which lessen the amount of oil residue. Another option is to install a matte-finish anti-glare [[screen protector]], which creates a slightly roughened surface that does not easily retain smudges.

===Glove touch===
Touchscreens do not work most of the time when the user wears gloves. The thickness of the glove and the material they are made of play a significant role on that and the ability of a touchscreen to pick up a touch.
