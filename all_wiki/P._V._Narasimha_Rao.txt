'''Pamulaparthi Venkata Narasimha Rao''' (28 June 1921 – 23 December 2004) was an Indian [[lawyer]] and [[politician]] who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of India|9th]] [[Prime Minister of India]] from 1991 to 1996. His ascendancy to the prime ministership was politically significant in that he was the second holder of this office from a non-Hindi-speaking region and the first from [[South India]]. He led an important administration, overseeing a major [[Economic liberalisation in India|economic transformation]] and several home incidents affecting national security of India.<ref name="Reforming">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4120429.stm|title=Narasimha Rao – a Reforming PM|work=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=23 December 2004|accessdate=2 March 2007}}</ref> Rao, who held the [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (India)|Industries portfolio]], was personally responsible for the dismantling of the [[Licence Raj]], as this came under the purview of the [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (India)|Ministry of Commerce and Industry]], reversing the [[Socialism|socialist]] policies of [[Rajiv Gandhi]]'s government.<ref name="DNAArticle">Arvind Kumar, Arun Narendhranath (3 October 2001).

According to a former [[Foreign Minister of India]] [[Natwar Singh]], "Unlike Nehru, his knowledge of Sanskrit was profound. Nehru had a temper, PV a temperament. His roots were deep in the spiritual and religious soil of India. He did not need to 'Discover India'". [[List of Presidents of India|11th]] [[President of India]] [[APJ Abdul Kalam]] described Rao as a "patriotic statesman who believed that the nation is bigger than the political system". Kalam acknowledged that Rao in fact asked him to get ready for nuclear tests in 1996 but they were not carried out as [[Govt of India|government at centre]] got changed due to [[1996 Indian general election|1996 general election]]. The tests were later conducted by Vajpayee-led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|NDA]] government. In fact Rao briefed Vajpayee on nuclear plans.<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/how-pv-became-pm/article3592852.ece How PV became PM], The Hindu, 2 July 2012.</ref>

Rao's term as Prime Minister was an eventful one in [[history of the Republic of India|India's history]]. Besides marking a paradigm shift from the industrialising, mixed economic model of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to a market driven one, his years as Prime Minister also saw the emergence of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), a major right-wing party, as an alternative to the [[Indian National Congress]] which had been governing India for most of its post-independence history. Rao's term also saw the destruction of the [[Babri Mosque]] in [[Ayodhya]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]] when BJP's Kalyan Singh was Chief Minister, which triggered one of the worst Hindu-Muslim riots in the country since its independence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/6/newsid_3712000/3712777.stm|title=BBC On This Day, 1992: Mob rips apart mosque in Ayodhya|work=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

Rao's government's goals were reducing the [[fiscal deficit]], [[privatisation]] of the public sector and increasing investment in infrastructure.

Major reforms in India's capital markets led to an influx of foreign portfolio investment. The major economic policies adopted by Rao include:

The impact of these reforms may be gauged from the fact that total foreign investment (including foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, and investment raised on international capital markets) in India grew from a minuscule US$132&nbsp;million in 1991–92 to $5.3&nbsp;billion in 1995–96.<ref name="Asiaweek"/> Rao began industrial policy reforms with the manufacturing sector.

===Father of Indian nuclear programme ===
Kalam recalls that Rao ordered him not to test, since "the election result was quite different from what he anticipated". The BJP's Atal Bihari Vajpayee took over as prime minister on 16 May 1996. Narasimha Rao, Abdul Kalam and R Chidambaram went to meet the new prime minister "so that", in Kalam's telling, "the smooth takeover of such a very important programme can take place".<ref name="scroll.in 810874"/>

Rao knew he had only one chance to test before sanctions kicked in, i.e., he could not both test conventional atomic bombs in December 1995 as well as the hydrogen bomb separately in April 1996. As Shekhar Gupta – who has had unprecedented access to Rao as well as the nuclear team – speculates: "By late 1995, Rao's scientists told him that they needed six more months. They could test some weapons but not others…thermonuclear etc. So Rao began a charade of taking preliminary steps to test, without intending to test then."

National elections were scheduled for May 1996, and Rao spent the next two months campaigning. On 8 May at 21:00, Abdul Kalam was asked to immediately meet with the prime minister. Rao told him, "Kalam, be ready with the Department of Atomic Energy and your team for the N-test and I am going to Tirupati. You wait for my authorisation to go ahead with the test. DRDO-DAE teams must be ready for action."
Rao energised the national nuclear security and ballistic missiles programme. His efforts resulted in the 1998 Pokhran nuclear tests.

Rao was the "true father" of India's nuclear programme. Vajpayee said that, in May 1996, a few days after he had succeeded Rao as prime minister, "Rao told me that the bomb was ready. I only exploded it."

"Saamagri tayyar hai," Rao had said. ("The ingredients are ready.") "You can go ahead."
The conventional narrative at the time was that prime minister Rao had wanted to test nuclear weapons in December 1995. The Americans had caught on, and Rao had dithered – as was his wont. Three years later, prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee fulfilled his party's campaign promise by ordering five nuclear tests below the shimmering sands of Rajasthan.<ref name="scroll.in 810874"/>

V. Narasimha Rao |2006|p=58}}

Later [[Liberhan Commission]], after extensive hearing and investigation, exonerated P.&nbsp;V. Narasimha Rao. It pointed out that Rao was heading a minority government, the Commission accepted the centre's submission that central forces could neither be deployed by the Union in the totality of facts and circumstances then prevailing, nor could President's Rule be imposed "on the basis of rumours or media reports". Taking such a step would have created "bad precedent" damaging the federal structure and would have "amounted to interference" in the state administration, it said. The state "deliberately and consciously understated" the risk to the disputed structure and general law and order. It also said that the Governor's assessment of the situation was either badly flawed or overly optimistic and was thus a major impediment for the central government. The Commission further said, "... knowing fully well that its facetious undertakings before the Supreme Court had bought it sufficient breathing space, it (state government) proceeded with the planning for the destruction of the disputed structure. The Supreme Court's own observer failed to alert it to the sinister undercurrents. The Governor and its intelligence agencies, charged with acting as the eyes and ears of the central government also failed in their task. Without substantive procedural prerequisites, neither the Supreme Court, nor the Union of India was able to take any meaningful steps."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/rao-govt-was-reduced-to-position-of-helpless-bystander/545902/0|title=Rao govt was reduced to position of helpless bystander|work=indianexpress.com}}</ref>

In yet another discussion with journalist [[Shekhar Gupta]], Rao answered several of the questions on the demolition. He said he was wary of the impact of hundreds of deaths on the nation, and it could have been far worse. And also he had to consider the scenario in which some of the troops might have turned around and joined the mobs instead. Regarding dismissal of Kalyan Singh (government), he said, "mere dismissal does not mean you can take control. It takes a day or so appointing advisers, sending them to Lucknow, taking control of the state. Meanwhile, what had to happen would have happened and there would have been no Kalyan Singh to blame either."<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/tearing-down-narasimha-rao/547260/0 Tearing down Narasimha Rao].

Rao's government faced a [[no-confidence motion]] in July 1993, because the opposition felt that it did not have sufficient numbers to prove a majority. It was alleged that Rao, through a representative, offered millions of rupees to members of the [[Jharkhand Mukti Morcha]] (JMM), and possibly a breakaway faction of the [[Janata Dal]], to vote for him during the confidence motion. [[Shailendra Mahato]], one of those members who had accepted the bribe, turned [[approver]]. In 1996, after Rao's term in office had expired, investigations began in earnest in the case. In 2000, after years of legal proceedings, a special court convicted Rao and his colleague, [[Buta Singh]] (who is alleged to have escorted the MPs to the Prime Minister).<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000930/main1.htm | title= Rao, Buta convicted in JMM bribery case | newspaper= [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] | date= 29 September 2000 | accessdate= 2 March 2007}}</ref> Rao was sentenced to three years in prison for corruption.

BBC News (12 October 2000). Retrieved 28 July 2013.</ref> Rao appealed to the [[Delhi High Court]] and remained free on bail. In 2002, the Delhi High Court overturned the lower court's decision mainly due to the doubt in credibility of Mahato's statements (which were extremely inconsistent) and both Rao and Buta Singh were cleared of the charges.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1874500.stm Ex-Indian PM cleared of bribery].

Rao, along with fellow minister K.&nbsp;K. Tewary, [[Chandraswami]] and K.&nbsp;N. Aggarwal, were accused of forging documents showing that Ajeya Singh had opened a bank account in the First Trust Corporation Bank in [[St. Kitts]] and deposited $21&nbsp;million in it, making his father [[V. P. Singh|V.&nbsp;P. Singh]] its beneficiary. The alleged intent was to tarnish V.&nbsp;P. Singh's image. This supposedly happened in 1989. However, only after Rao's term as PM had expired in 1996, was he formally charged by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) for the crime. Less than a year later the court acquitted him due to lack of evidence linking him with the case.<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2004-10-25/india/27143956_1_chandraswami-first-trust-corporation-forgery-case St Kitts case: Chronology of events].

Lakhubhai Pathak, an Indian businessman living in England, alleged that [[Chandraswami]] and K.&nbsp;N. Aggarwal alias Mamaji, along with Rao, cheated him out of $100,000. The amount was given for an express promise for allowing supplies of paper pulp in India, and Pathak alleged that he spent an additional $30,000 entertaining Chandraswami and his secretary. Narasimha Rao and Chandraswami were acquitted of the charges in 2003 and before his death, Rao was acquitted of all the cases charged against him,<ref>{{cite news | last= Kumar | first= Nirnimesh | date= 23 December 2003 | url= http://www.hindu.com/2003/12/23/stories/2003122308160100.htm | title= Rao acquitted in Lakhubhai Pathak case | newspaper= [[The Hindu]] | accessdate= 2 March 2007}}</ref>

==Later life and financial difficulties==
In spite of significant achievements in a difficult situation, in the [[1996 Indian general election|1996 general elections]] the Indian electorate voted out Rao's Congress Party. Soon, Sonia Gandhi's supporters forced Mr. Rao to step down as Party President. He was replaced by [[Sitaram Kesri]].

Rao rarely spoke of his personal views and opinions during his 5-year tenure. After his retirement from national politics, he published a novel called [[The Insider (Rao novel)|The Insider]].{{sfn|P V N Rao|2000|p=}} The book, which follows a man's rise through the ranks of Indian politics, resembled events from Rao's own life.

According to a vernacular source, despite holding many influential posts in Government, he faced many financial troubles. One of his sons was educated with the assistance of his son-in-law. He also faced trouble paying fees for a daughter who was studying medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://telugu.greatandhra.com/cinema/11-04-2010/39a_04_nin.php|archivedate=24 April 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424002302/http://telugu.greatandhra.com/cinema/11-04-2010/39a_04_nin.php|title=Nindalapaalaina Aparachanukyudu-2|work=Telugu.greatandhra.com|accessdate=10 July 2012}}</ref> According to [[P.

He also translated Hari Narayan Apte's Marathi novel ''[[Pan Lakshat Kon Gheto]]'' (But Who Pays Attention?) into Telugu. He was also invited to be the chief guest of Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Sanmelan where he gave speech in Marathi.

In his later life he wrote his autobiography, ''The Insider'', which depicts his experiences in politics.

<blockquote>
"Sonia Gandhi praised contributions of all Congress prime ministers except P V Narasimha Rao in her speech ... Making no mention of Rao in her 15-minute speech, she said Rajiv Gandhi scripted the course of economic policies that were followed by the government (headed by Rao) for the following five years."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Even today, the Congress leadership shows extreme reluctance to acknowledge the role PV Narasimha Rao played in appointing [[Manmohan Singh]] as his finance minister and giving him the freedom to unveil the economic reforms package to bail the Indian economy out of an unprecedented crisis. The Congress leadership was correct in blaming Narasimha Rao for his political misjudgment on the [[Ayodhya debate|Ayodhya issue]]. But it is now time the same leadership also acknowledged Narasimha Rao's role in ushering in economic reforms."
