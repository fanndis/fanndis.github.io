'''''The Lorax''''' (also known as '''''Dr. Seuss' The Lorax''''') is a 2012 American [[3D film|3D]] [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[Fantasy film|fantasy comedy film]] produced by [[Illumination (company)|Illumination Entertainment]] and based on [[Dr. Seuss]]' [[children's book]] of the [[The Lorax|same name]]. The film was released by [[Universal Pictures]] on March 2, 2012, on what would have been Seuss's 108th birthday.

The second [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of the book (following the [[The Lorax (TV special)|1972 animated television special]]), the film builds on the book by expanding the story of the Lorax and Ted, the previously unnamed boy who visits the Once-ler. The cast includes [[Danny DeVito]] as the Lorax, [[Ed Helms]] as the Once-ler and [[Zac Efron]] as Ted. New characters introduced in the film are Audrey, Ted's love interest (voiced by [[Taylor Swift]]), Aloysius O'Hare, an evil air baron (voiced by [[Rob Riggle]]), Mrs. Wiggins, Ted's mother (voiced by [[Jenny Slate]]), and Grammy Norma, Ted's grandmother (voiced by [[Betty White]]).<ref name="The Lorax">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/813236/Dr-Seuss-The-Lorax/full-credits.html|title=The Lorax|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|accessdate=July 19, 2017}}</ref> The film grossed $348.8 million worldwide based on a $70 million budget.<ref name="BOM"/>

==Plot==
12-year-old Ted Wiggins lives in Thneedville, a [[walled city]] where all vegetation and plant-life are artifical ("Thneedville"). Ted has a crush on environmentalist Audrey, and decides to impress her with a "real tree". His grandmother Norma tells him the legend of the Once-ler, who knows what happened to the trees. Leaving Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, Ted discovers that the outside world is a barren, contaminated wasteland. He finds the Once-ler, who agrees to tell him the story of the trees over multiple visits. The next time he leaves home, Ted encounters Thneedville's greedy mayor Aloysius O'Hare whose company sells bottled [[oxygen]] to the polluted city. Explaining that trees, and the oxygen they produce freely, pose a threat to his business, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town, but Ted continues to visit the Once-ler.

The Once-ler recounts how, as a young inventor, he arrived in a lush forest of animals and Truffula trees ("This is The Place"). Cutting down a tree, he was confronted by the Lorax, the guardian of the forest who "speaks for the trees". After attempting to force the Once-ler out, the Lorax convinced him not to harm any more trees. Using the Truffula tree, the Once-ler created the "Thneed", a piece of cloth with multiple uses, which became a major success ("Everybody Needs a Thneed"). His unscrouplous relatives persuaded him to resume chopping down trees to mass-produce Thneeds, leading to enormous profits but [[deforestation]] and [[pollution]] ("How Bad Can I Be?"). After harvesting the last Truffula tree, the Once-ler was ruined, abandoned by his family, and became a [[recluse]]. The Once-ler was left heartbroken and unbearably guilty for destroying the forest. With the region uninhabitable, the Lorax sent the animals away to find a new place to live, and vanished into the sky. The Lorax left a single word on a small pile of rocks: "Unless".

The Once-ler gives Ted the last Truffula seed in hopes he can regrow the forest and make others care about trees. Ted returns home to plant the seed, which is spotted by O'Hare's city-wide surveillance. Enlisting the help of Audrey and his family, Ted is pursued by O'Hare to the center of town. O'Hare rallies the citizens against Ted, telling them that trees are dangerous and filthy, but Ted uses an [[earthmover]] to knock down a section of the city wall, revealing the environmental destruction outside. Inspired by Ted's conviction, the crowd turns on O'Hare, and the seed is finally planted ("Let It Grow"). Time passes and the land begins to recover; new trees sprout, animals return, and the now-elderly Once-ler reunites with the Lorax.

The film ends with a quote from Dr. Seuss: "Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not."

==Production==
The film is the fourth feature film based on a book by Dr. Seuss, the second fully computer-animated adaptation (the first one being ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]''), and the first to be released in 3-D. ''The Lorax'' was also Illumination's first film presented in [[IMAX 3D]] (known as "IMAX Tree-D" in publicity for the film).<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Seuss' The Lorax: An IMAX 3D Experience|url=http://www.imax.com/movies/m/dr-seuss-the-lorax-an-imax-3d-experience/|work=IMAX|accessdate=November 12, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029202936/http://www.imax.com/movies/m/dr-seuss-the-lorax-an-imax-3d-experience/|archivedate=October 29, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The idea for the film was initiated by [[Audrey Geisel]], Dr. Seuss's wife, who had an established partnership with [[Chris Meledandri]], the producer of the film, from a collaboration on ''Horton Hears a Who!''.

Three mini-movies were released on the ''Lorax'' Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack on August 7, 2012: ''Serenade'', ''Wagon Ho!'', and ''Forces of Nature''.<ref name="DVDBlu-ray">{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/from-universal-studios-home-entertainment-dr-seuss-the-lorax-157198345.html|title=From Universal Studios Home Entertainment: Dr. Seuss' The Lorax|date=June 5, 2012|accessdate=June 5, 2012|newspaper=PR Newswire}}</ref>

;''Serenade''
Lou wants to impress a girl Barbaloot, but he has some competition.

;''Wagon Ho!''
The Once-ler arrives with his wagon and Melvin. Then Pipsqueak and Lou arrive. The Once-ler tells them not to have [[Joyride (crime)|joyrides]]. When the Once-ler goes inside his house, Pipsqueak and Lou start cranking up the wagon, but Melvin refuses to pull it because he is angry that they whipped the reins. So Pipsqueak hangs a Truffula fruit in front of Melvin as an incentive. However, Melvin gets exhausted going up a steep hill. Then the wagon gets unhooked from Melvin, and it rolls downhill backwards while Pipsqueak and Lou scream in terror. Melvin chases the runaway wagon. Lou tries to stop the wagon by stabbing a stick in one of its [[wheel]]s, but he gets stuck on the wheel instead. Finally, he lands back on the seat next to Pipsqueak, who hugs him happily. The wagon hits a rock and is propelled downhill even faster. When it approaches a cliff, Pipsqueak panics and grabs the wagon canopy, which flies off—only to be held in place by Lou. The wagon flies off the cliff, but the canopy acts as a parachute and they make their descent calmly, landing in the same place they left. Melvin appears shortly after. The Once-ler comes out of the house and is surprised to see them. He expresses surprise that they listened to instructions, but just when it seems like they fooled him, Lou sneezes and the wagon falls apart. Melvin hides beneath his hooves and Lou and Pipsqueak curl up into a ball. The Once-ler looks annoyed and makes a small, disgruntled "Grr" sound, causing Lou and Pipsqueak to run away into the trees.

;''Forces of Nature''
The Lorax makes Pipsqueak an Honorary Lorax and team up to scare the Once-ler by using two sticks that looks like a monster's hand to freak him out. The Once-ler finds out it is fake and sprays water on the Lorax, which makes his fur puff up. When the Lorax tells Pipsqueak that he is going to turn out like him, Pipsqueak gets scared and runs away. The short ends with the Lorax telling Pipsqueak that he has lost his Honorary Lorax title.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
<!-- WHEN UPDATING REVIEW AGGREGATE SCORES, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE EVERY FIELD IN THE CITATION, INCLUDING THE ACCESS DATE. -->
The film earned a rating of 54% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 157 reviews and an average rating of 5.9/10, with the critical consensus saying, "''Dr. Seuss' The Lorax'' is cute and funny enough but the moral simplicity of the book gets lost with the zany Hollywood production values."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lorax_2012/|title=The Lorax|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=March 9, 2019}}</ref> It also has a score of 46 on [[Metacritic]] based on 30 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/dr-seuss-the-lorax|title=The Lorax|work=Metacritic|accessdate=March 7, 2012}}</ref>

''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine film critic [[David Edelstein]] on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]'' strongly objected to the movie, arguing that the Hollywood animation and writing formulas washed out the spirit of the book.<ref>{{cite web|last=Edelstein|first=David|title='The Lorax': A Campy And Whimsical Seussical|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/02/147573582/the-lorax-a-campy-and-whimsical-seussical|work=All Things Considered|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=March 2, 2012}}</ref> "This kind of studio 3-D feature animation is all wrong for the material," he wrote. Demonstrating how the book's text was used in the movie in this excerpt from the review, Edelstein discusses Audrey describing the truffula trees to Ted:
{{Quote|The touch of their tufts was much softer than silk and they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk – and [in the movie] Ted says, "Wow, what does that even mean?" and Audrey says, "I know, right?" So one of the only lines that is from the book, that does have Dr. Seuss' sublime whimsy, is basically made fun of, or at least, dragged down to Earth.}}

The film also garnered some positive reviews from critics such as [[Richard Roeper]], who called it a "solid piece of family entertainment".<ref name="richroeper">{{cite web|last=Roeper|first=Richard|title=Dr. Seuss' The Lorax Review|url=http://www.richardroeper.com/reviews/drseussthelorax.aspx|publisher=Richard Roeper & The Movies|accessdate=August 24, 2012}}</ref> Roger Moore of the ''Pittsburgh Tribune'' called the film "a feast of bright, Seuss colors, and wonderful Seuss design", and supported its environmentalist message.<ref name="rogermoore">{{cite journal|last=Moore|first=Roger|title=Review: 'Dr. Seuss' The Lorax' a feast of bright colors, design|journal=Pittsburgh Tribune|date=March 1, 2012|url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/movies/s_784370.html}}</ref>
