'''Fossil Downs Station''' is a pastoral lease and [[cattle station]] located about {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} North East of [[Fitzroy Crossing, Western Australia|Fitzroy Crossing]] in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region  of [[Western Australia]].

==History==
The first Europeans to visit the area were part of [[Alexander Forrest]]'s party who passed through in 1879 followed by Charles Hall in 1885. Hall later struck gold at [[Halls Creek, Western Australia|Halls Creek]]. The station was established the following year when [[cattle]] arrived from the eastern states to stock the lease.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/K-L%20-%20A-D/Low%20Level%20Crossing%20(P-AD).PDF|title=Register of Heritage Places – Assessment Documentation – Fitzroy Crossing|year=1996|accessdate=25 June 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312135501/http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/K-L%20-%20A-D/Low%20Level%20Crossing%20%28P-AD%29.PDF|archivedate=12 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The lease had been issued in 1883 to [[Donald MacDonald (pastoralist)|Dan MacDonald]] for the MacDonald family who were living in Cliffords Creek, New South Wales at the time. He applied for an area of {{convert|100|sqmi|sqkm|0}} at the junction of the [[Margaret River (Kimberley region, Western Australia)|Margaret]] and [[Fitzroy River (Western Australia)|Fitzroy River]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/F%20-%20A-D/Fossil%20Downs%20Hmstd%20(P-AD).PDF|title=Register of Heritage Places – Assessment Documentation – Fossil Downs Homestead|year=1996|accessdate=25 June 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312135514/http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/F%20-%20A-D/Fossil%20Downs%20Hmstd%20%28P-AD%29.PDF|archivedate=12 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The MacDonalds, together with the McKenzie family from the Junction near [[Tuena, New South Wales|Tuena]], who were close friends and related through marriage to the MacDonalds, formed a partnership to stock and equip the station in Western Australia. The McKenzies paid the £25 for the first year's rent and the families departed their New South Wales properties in March 1883. 
Donald MacDonald died early on the journey after being thrown from a horse, leaving two of his sons, Charles and William, to drive the stock {{convert|5600|km|mi|0}} to the new property. They left with 700 head of cattle and 60 horses, encountering [[drought]] conditions as they trekked through [[Queensland]]. Arriving at the property in June 1886<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17420059 |title=Goulburn girl at Fossil Downs. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=New South Wales |date=16 September 1937 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |page=19 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> with 327 cattle and 13 horses the brothers reunited with Dan and set up camp. This is thought to be the longest [[Land|overland]] cattle drove in Australia's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://secure.environment.gov.au/heritage/west-kimberley/pubs/landholders-guide.pdf|title=West Kimberley National Heritage|date=25 June 2011}}</ref>

The gold rush at Halls Creek provided a nearby market for beef so the MacDonald brothers continued to run the property while the McKenzies financed the operating costs. In c1900, the McKenzies sold their stake to the MacDonalds. Charles MacDonald died in 1903 and William in 1910, leaving the property to Dan MacDonald. The station prospered and MacDonald expanded by taking over the leases of surrounding properties and also began to strengthen his stock by infusing [[Red Poll]] cattle into the [[Shorthorn]] herd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/F%20-%20A-D/Fossil%20Downs%20Hmstd%20(P-AD).PDF|title=Register of Heritage Places – Assessment Documentation – Fossil Downs Homestead|year=1996|accessdate=25 June 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312135514/http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/F%20-%20A-D/Fossil%20Downs%20Hmstd%20%28P-AD%29.PDF|archivedate=12 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The station was exporting some 1,500 head annually to [[Java]] via [[Derby, Western Australia|Derby]] by 1915.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18390378 |title="Herald" Saturday Magazine. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=New South Wales |date=8 August 1953 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

In the early 1920s, despite the drought of 1924 and problems with [[Rhipicephalus microplus|cattle tick]]s, pastoralists in the area continued to prosper with the opening of an [[abattoir]] in [[Wyndham, Western Australia|Wyndham]] and the establishment of a [[stock route]] from Wyndham to the central Kimberley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/11738%20Air%20Beef%20Abbatoir%20(I-AD).PDF|title=Register of Heritage Places – Assessment Documentation – Air Beef Abattoir an Glenroy Group|year=2006|accessdate=25 June 2011}}</ref>

Cattle king [[Sidney Kidman]] bought a half share in Fossil Downs in the 1920s for £75,000, which Dan MacDonald bought back in 1928 with the help of his brother Duncan, making him sole owner of the property again. Dan MacDonald's son William bought into the property in 1931 and when his father died in 1939, William assumed control of Fossil Downs. A trained architect, William demolished the old wood and iron homestead that had suffered [[termite]] damage and designed a new homestead to be constructed some {{convert|14|km|mi|0}} away from the old one, for his new bride Maxine.<ref>[[George Farwell|Farwell, George]], Cape York to the Kimberleys, Rigby Limited, Adelaide, 1962, chapter 18</ref>

By the early 1950s the station's size was estimated at about {{convert|1000000|acre|sqkm|0}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47428918 |title=Holiday On Famous Station In The Far North-West. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=30 July 1952 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and had over 20,000 branded cattle with 20 white staff and 60 [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] employees.

In 1952(?) at Fossil Downs Homestead, Preston Walker of UAM Mission Fitzroy Crossing married the head stockman and his bride a nursing sister from Darwin.<ref>Westralian gems for Christ's crown by S Preston Walker, 2001, p.33</ref>

A large proportion of the West Kimberley was afflicted by [[drought]] in 1952 and 1953 including Fossil Downs. Virtually all feed was lost and even many native trees started dying as a result of intense heat and lack of water.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49227202 |title=Drought Inflicts Big Cattle Loss In Kimberley.|newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=17 August 1953 |accessdate=14 June 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The number of cattle in the area was reduced by half. This was the first drought suffered by pastoralists in 70 years with many hurriedly sinking bores and buying feed to keep their stock alive. Other nearby properties that were affected in [[Noonkanbah]], [[Liveringa]], Quandan, [[Gogo Station|Gogo]], [[Glenroy Station|Glenroy]], [[Cherrabun]], Luiluigui, Christmas Creek and Bohemia Downs Station.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49227202 |title=Drought Inflicts Big Cattle Loss In Kimberley. |newspaper=[[The West Australian]] |location=Perth |date=17 August 1953 |accessdate=15 November 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

The remote [[Muludja Community]] is located on the station within {{convert|2.7|km|mi|0}} from the [[Homestead (buildings)|homestead]], but on the other side of the river. The community was originally situated nearer the homestead but was moved in the 1990s and has a population of approximately 100 people, all of whom are [[Indigenous Australians|of Aboriginal descent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisreview.com.au/Reviews/Education/Specialists/Western-Australia/Muludja-Remote-Community-School-Fossil-Downs-Western-Australia|title=This Review – Muludja Remote Community School|year=2010|accessdate=25 June 2011}}</ref>

The station's name is derived from fossilised animals and plants that are found in the many [[limestone]] outcrops, the [[Gogo Formation]], in the area.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39369631 |title=Past and Present. |newspaper=[[Western Mail (Western Australia)|Western Mail]] |location=Perth |date=23 December 1954 |accessdate=27 June 2011 |page=14 Supplement: The Western Mail Annual 1954 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

While many stations in the Kimberley have experienced a decline in native pastures, mostly from [[overgrazing]], Fossil Downs has bucked the trend thanks to years of collecting seed by hand from good pastures and spreading them over the rest of the property as well as rotational grazing. The return of [[Ptilotus|Mulla Mulla]] in feed with its high [[protein]] content is good for cattle and also good for the environment with its ability to stabilize soil.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rural/content/2011/s3330528.htm|title=Station getting more mulla for its cattle|author=Matt Brann|date=2 October 2011|accessdate=4 May 2013|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref>

The leasee in 2012 is WNM MacDonald Pty Ltd, Fossil Downs is operating under the Crown Lease number CL126-1989 and has the Land Act number LA3114/1248.

In 2015 [[Gina Rinehart]] acquired Fossil Downs after it was placed on the market for the first time in 133 years. The {{convert|4000|km2|sqmi|0}} property was stocked with 15,000 head of cattle and the sale price was not disclosed,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-26/gina-rinehart-buying-kimberley-cattle-station/6648954|title=Gina Rinehart buys iconic Kimberley cattle station Fossil Downs|date=27 July 2015|accessdate=28 July 2015|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> but estimated to be between {{AUD}}25 to 30 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-27/rinehart-out-bids-global-interest-in-fossil-downs-estate-agent/6651636|title=Gina Rinehart out-bids 'unprecedented' global and domestic interest in Fossil Downs Station: estate agent|author=Belinda Varischetti|work=ABC Rural|date=27 July 2015|accessdate=28 July 2015|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref>
