The '''Robert H. Smith School of Business''' ('''Smith School''') is the business school at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], a public [[research university]] in [[College Park, Maryland]]. The school was named after alumnus [[Robert H. Smith (philanthropist)|Robert H. Smith]] (Accounting '50). One of 12 colleges and schools at the university's main campus, the Smith School offers programs at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.<ref name="Smith_School_Enrollment_by_Major"/> It is accredited by the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB) to award bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees.

== History ==

=== 20th century ===

By the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, the [[United States]] had become the leading economic power in the world, and both U.S. domestic business and U.S investment in overseas operations surged.<ref name=US_Post_WW1_Boom/> The stage was set for U.S. universities to heighten focus on formal [[Business education]]. In 1921, [[University of Maryland, College Park]] (UMD) introduced an undergraduate business program within the existing Department of Economics/Business Administration that included courses in [[Diplomacy]], [[Constitutional law]], and [[Public speaking]]. Less than 400 students enrolled. 17 years later in 1938, UMD restructured the burgeoning business program into a separate college within the University, renamed the department to the College of Commerce, and appointed internationally recognized economist Dr. W. Mackenzie Stevens to be its first dean. By 1940 the College of Commerce undergraduate business program had earned [[accreditation]] from the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) (now internationalized under the name [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]]). In 1942, new Dean J. Freeman Pyle expanded the curriculum to deliver classes on [[Public administration]], and reflected this widened scope by renaming to the College of Business and Public Administration (BPA).<ref name=RHS_History/>

When [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, many students and faculty left school to join the [[military]], shrinking 1943 BPA enrollment to only 130 [[civilians]].<ref name=RHS_History/> After World War II ended and with the passage of the 1944 [[G.I. Bill]] to federally subsidize veteran's higher education costs,<ref name=US_GI_Bill_Impact/> BPA grew substantially in size, instituted a graduate program, and in 1947 issued its first graduate degree - a Masters in Business Administration (MBA). By 1948 enrollment had climbed back to 2,200 students.<ref name=RHS_History/>

In 1961, UMD knocked down an old wooden gymnasium shed and built the new building Millard E. Tydings Hall, which was named after Maryland senator and Maryland Agricultural College (a predecessor school now rolled up into UMD) engineering alumnus "Scott" [[Millard E. Tydings]].<ref name=MAC_Tyding_Hall/> College of Business and Public Administration (BPA) moved in and remained there into the 1990s. In 1962, the BPA's graduate MBA program became one of the first MBA programs accredited by AACSB. In 1964 women enrollment grew significantly, and after several years women became fully integrated into student networking organizations and clubs. By 1966 BPA issued its first [[Doctoral degree]] - Doctor of [[Business Administration]] (DBA), and within three years this became a PhD program. Over the next three years, BPA segmented the undergraduate business curriculum into separate disciplines such as [[Information System]]s, [[Marketing]], [[Business]] and [[Public Policy]], [[Accounting]], [[Organizational Behavior]] (now [[Management]]), and [[Quantitative research|Quantitative]] (now [[Statistics]]) in order to better align with business practices. During the same period, BPA actively undertook initiatives to increase enrollment of [[women]] and [[minorities]], such as recruiting at [[historically black colleges and universities]] and providing targeted financial aid.<ref name=RHS_History/>

In 1973, the [[Business Administration]] department within BPA was spun off as a standalone [[college]] called College of Business and Management (CBM), with professional jazz saxophone player Rudolph "Rudy" P. Lamone appointed to begin his nineteen year [[tenure]] as [[Dean (education)|Dean]]. Two years later, the part-time evening MBA programs catering to working professionals were launched at both CBM's main campus in [[College Park, Maryland]] and CBM's secondary campus north west in [[Shady Grove, Maryland]]. In 1978, CBM instituted its own undergraduate [[University and college admission|admissions]] program to enable more selective student recruitment. In 1979, the school offered its first [[Master of Science]] (MS) degrees, including an MS in the newly-added discipline [[Finance]].<ref name=RHS_History/>

In 1987, CBM launched a pioneering entrepreneurship [[Business incubator|incubator]] called Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship, which was named after donor [[Michael D. Dingman]], the founder of Signal Corporation (later merged into [[AlliedSignal]], and then into [[Honeywell]]).<ref name=RHS_History/>

In 1993, CBM consolidated from Tydings Hall and other College Park locations into the newly-constructed Van Munching Hall on the College Park campus, which building was named after alumnus donor Leo Van Munching, Jr., the president of a [[New York City]] company that imported [[Heineken]] [[beer]]. The same year, the College of Business and Management Foundation (CBMF) infused $250,000 into a [[Student managed investments|student-run investment management fund]] named The [[Maryland Terrapins|Terrapin]] Fund. In 1995, CBM was renamed to the Maryland Business School (MBS). In 1996, MBS reached into [[Europe]] for the first time by partnering with the [[University of Łódź]] to deliver a Management Education program in [[Lodz]] [[Poland]]. Also in 1996, the school augmented its [[MBA]] program with an [[experiential learning]] module (ELM) wherein the school suspends all activities in order to focus on [[Ethics]]. In 1999, The Terrapin Fund was renamed to the Mayer Fund in honor of alumnus donor [[William Daniel Mayer]].<ref name=RHS_History/>

In the mid 1990s, groundbreaking [[online marketplace]] platforms and [[e-commerce]] payment systems such as [[Amazon.com]] (1995), [[eBay]] (1995), and [[PayPal]] (1998) were launched.<ref name=Timeline_of_eCommerce/> In 1998, the school recognized the growing role of [[information technology]] by adding new MBA [[Major (academic)|concentrations]] such as [[Telecommunication]], [[Technology management]], [[Supply-chain management|Supply Chain]] and [[Logistics Management]], and [[Electronic commerce]]. The same year, the business school was renamed to Robert H. Smith School of Business in honor of alumnus donor Robert H. Smith (RHS), who was the real estate developer behind building [[Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia|Crystal City]] complex in [[Arlington County, Virginia]]. One year later, RHS extended its part-time evening MBA program to a new [[Baltimore]] [[campus]]. Also in 1999, a second donation from alumnus Leo Van Munching Jr. was used to begin an expansion that would ultimately double the size of Van Munching Hall.<ref name=RHS_History/>

=== 21st century ===

The Smith School began 2000 by extending the part-time, evening MBA program to a 3rd campus in [[Washington, D.C.]] Two years later RHS completed the expansion of Van Munching Hall, and RHS was able to consolidate all [[undergraduate]] and [[graduate school]] students into a single building. In 2003, the Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship helped launch a public [[venture capital]] fund for fledgling mid-Atlantic companies called the New Markets Growth Fund (NMGF). In 2003, the Smith School added its executive MBA (EMBA) program to the College Park campus curriculum, and made its first inroads into [[Asia]] by developing and teaching the EMBA curriculum in [[Beijing]], [[China]] in partnership with the hosting [[University of International Business and Economics (Beijing)|University of International Business and Economics]]. In 2006 the college instituted a graduate Master of Business in [[Accounting]] program, in part to satisfy increased industry demand for audit professionals due to the 2002 U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The same year, the Smith School launched the [[Lemma Senbet Fund]] [[Student managed investments|student-run investment management fund]] for undergraduate Finance students starting with an initial capital infusion of $50,000. In 2009, Smith added another [[Master of Science]] (MS) business degree with a concentration in [[Finance]].<ref name=RHS_History/>

In the 2000s, most major universities began to add web-based ("online") courses to their curriculum.<ref name=History_Online_Education/> In 2013, the Smith School created its first online degree program, which culminates in an MBA.<ref name=RHS_History/>

== Campuses ==
The Robert H. Smith School of Business is a part of the [[University of Maryland]], located principally in [[College Park, MD]], just northeast of [[Washington, D.C.]] The school also has a presence at [[Shady Grove, Maryland|Shady Grove]], [[Baltimore]], as well as in the [[Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center]] in Washington, D.C. The Smith School offers an executive MBA program in [[Beijing, China]].

== Academics ==
The Smith School offers programs at both the graduate and undergraduate levels, including [[Bachelor's degree]]s, [[Master's degree]], and [[PhD]]s. Degrees are offered in traditional business school majors such as [[Accounting]] and [[Finance]].<ref name="Smith_School_Enrollment_by_Major"/> However, for certain concentrations often offered by standalone business colleges (e.g., [[Economics]]), University of Maryland (UMD) instead offers those programs and associated degrees in a different sister school within the university.
