==Seeding and draw==

In September 2009, [[FIFA]] announced that they would be [[Seed (sports)|seeding]] teams for the play-off draw. The eight eventual qualifiers were seeded according to the [[FIFA World Rankings|world rankings]] released on 16 October 2009. The top four teams were placed into one pot, with the bottom four teams placed into a second. A separate draw was conducted between each matchup to decide the host of the first leg.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Key Decisions Reached in Rio |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/media/newsid=1109930.html |publisher=FIFA |date=29 September 2009 |accessdate=19 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003015843/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/media/newsid%3D1109930.html |archivedate=3 October 2009 }}</ref>

===Seeding controversy===

Seeding using FIFA ranks was used at a similar stage in the 2006 qualification. However, it was claimed that FIFA had indicated that there would be no seeding this time.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Fifa to seed countries for play-offs |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/soccer/2009/0930/1224255543996.html |work=[[The Irish Times]] |date=September 30, 2009 |accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref> At the time of the decision, countries in play-off positions included [[Russia national football team|Russia]], [[France national football team|France]] and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], and [[Germany national football team|Germany]] also had not yet qualified (their last remaining match was away to [[Russia national football team|Russia]]). The lack of a decision on seeding until late in the tournament led some to suggest that FIFA were waiting to see which teams were in the play-offs before declaring the rules of the tournament. Commenting on this matter, [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] goalkeeper [[Shay Given]] said:
:''It’s totally unfair on us smaller nations. If they say that before a ball is kicked then at least you know the picture, you know exactly where you stand but to change it now is absolutely ridiculous and I don’t think it’s right at all.''<ref>{{Cite news |title=Given frustrated by Fifa seeding |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2009/1007/1224256098958.html |work=[[The Irish Times]] |date=October 7, 2009 |accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref>
''[[Sports Illustrated]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Gabriele Marcotti]] gave the opinion that "FIFA is pretty much changing the rules halfway through the qualifying tournament.''<ref>{{Cite news |first=Gabriel |last=Marcotti |title=Is FIFA giving special treatment? |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/gabriele_marcotti/10/08/fifa.qualifying/ |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=October 8, 2009 |accessdate=19 November 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091213220448/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/gabriele_marcotti/10/08/fifa.qualifying/| archivedate= 13 December 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>
