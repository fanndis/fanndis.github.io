'''Eastbourne''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-Eastbourne.ogg|ˈ|iː|s|t|b|ɔr|n}}) is a town, seaside resort and borough in the non-metropolitan county of [[East Sussex]] on the south coast of England, {{convert|19|mi|km}} east of [[Brighton]]. Eastbourne is immediately to the east of [[Beachy Head]], the highest chalk sea cliff in [[Great Britain]] and part of the larger [[Eastbourne Downland Estate]].

With a seafront consisting largely of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] hotels, [[Eastbourne Pier|a pier]] and a [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic]] era [[Eastbourne Redoubt|fort and military museum]], Eastbourne was developed at the direction of the [[Duke of Devonshire]] from 1859 from four separate hamlets. It has a growing population, a broad economic base and is home to companies in a wide range of industries.

Though Eastbourne is a relatively new town, there is evidence of human occupation in the area from the [[Stone Age]].  The town grew as a fashionable tourist resort largely thanks to prominent landowner, William Cavendish, later to become the Duke of Devonshire. Cavendish appointed architect Henry Currey to design a street plan for the town, but not before sending him to Europe to draw inspiration. The resulting mix of architecture is typically [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and remains a key feature of Eastbourne.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eastbourne's story|url=http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=226&type=full&servicetype=Inline|publisher=Eastbourne Borough Council|access-date=29 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928031242/http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=226&type=full&servicetype=Inline|archive-date=28 September 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

As a seaside resort, Eastbourne derives a large and increasing income from tourism, with revenue from traditional seaside attractions augmented by conferences, public events and cultural sightseeing. The other main industries in Eastbourne include trade and retail, healthcare, education, construction, manufacturing, professional scientific and the technical sector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsussexinfigures.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?catalog=http%3A%2F%2Fesfigures01s.escc.gov.uk%3A80%2Fobj%2FfCatalog%2FCatalog54&submode=catalog&mode=documentation&top=yes|work=2011 Census, Office for National Statistics|title= East Sussex in Figures, Economy profile for Eastbourne, Business by industrial sector in 2012|publisher=East Sussex County Council}}</ref>

Eastbourne's population is growing; between 2001 and 2011 it increased from 89,800 to 99,412. The 2011 census shows that the average age of residents has decreased as the town has attracted students, families and those commuting to [[London]] and Brighton.<ref>{{cite web |title= Age structure, local authorities in England and Wales, Table KS02 Age structure |url= http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/search/index.html?pageSize=50&sortBy=none&sortDirection=none&newquery=eastbourne+age+profile |agency= Census, Office for National Statistics |work= Table KS102EW 2011}}</ref> In June 2019, the population of Eastbourne was estimated to be 103,745.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eastsussexinfigures.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?mode=area&submode=result&areaname=Eastbourne&areatype=LA |title=Population and households profile for Eastbourne |website=East Sussex in Figures |date=June 2019 |access-date=19 June 2020}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Pre-Roman ===
Flint mines and [[Stone Age]] artefacts have been found in the surrounding countryside of the [[Eastbourne Downs]].

A Bronze Age site of national importance was discovered in Hydneye lake at [[Shinewater]] in 1995.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1400780 |desc=Shinewater Bronze Age settlement |accessdate=13 September 2019}}</ref>

[[Celts|Celtic]] people are believed to have settled on the Eastbourne Downland in 500{{nbsp}}BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/_resources/assets/inline/full/0/205020.pdf|title=EASTBOURNE TIMELINE|website=Eastbourne.gov.uk|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref>

=== Roman era ===
There are [[Roman Britain|Roman]] remains buried beneath the town, such as a Roman bath and section of pavement between Eastbourne Pier and the Redoubt Fortress. There is also a Roman villa near the entrance to the Pier and the present Queens Hotel.<ref name=WRIGHT>{{Citation|last=Wright|first=J C|title=Bygone Eastbourne|place=Eastbourne|publisher=Spottiswoode|year=1902}}</ref>

In 2014, skeletal remains of a woman who lived around 425{{nbsp}}AD were discovered in the vicinity of [[Beachy Head]] on the [[Eastbourne Downland Estate]]. The remains were found to be of a 30-year-old woman who grew up in [[East Sussex]], but had genetic heritage from sub-Saharan Africa, giving her black skin and an African skeletal structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-25962183|title=Centuries old woman's face revealed|date=1 February 2014|access-date=28 January 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Her ancestors came from below the Saharan region, at a time when the Roman Empire extended only as far as North Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/archaeology/art474162-beachy-head-lady-was-young-sub-saharan-roman-with-good-teeth-say-archaeologists|title=Beachy Head Lady was young sub-Saharan Roman with good teeth, say archaeologists|website=Culture24.org.uk|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref>

=== Anglo-Saxon era ===
An [[Sub-Roman Britain|Anglo-Saxon]] charter, circa 963&nbsp;AD, describes a landing stage and stream at Burne.

The original name came from the 'Burne' or stream which ran through today's Old Town area of Eastbourne. All that can be seen of the Burne, or Bourne, is the small pond in Motcombe Gardens. The bubbling source is guarded by a statue of Neptune.<ref name="eastbourne.gov.uk">{{Cite web |url=http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/residents/leisure-and-events/art-culture/family-local-history/eastbourne/ |title=History of Eastbourne |access-date=12 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625115944/http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/residents/leisure-and-events/art-culture/family-local-history/eastbourne/ |archive-date=25 June 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Motcombe Gardens are overlooked by St. Mary's Church, a Norman church which allegedly lies on the site of a Saxon 'moot', or meeting place. This gives Motcombe its name.

In 2014 local metal-detectorist Darrin Simpson found a coin minted during the reign of [[Æthelberht II of East Anglia]] (died 794), in a field near the town. It is believed that the coin may have led to Æthelberht's beheading by [[Offa of Mercia]], as it had been struck as a sign of independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-27485772 |title='Unique' Anglo-Saxon coin could give royal murder clue |work=BBC News |date=20 May 2014 |access-date=14 June 2014}}</ref> Describing the coin, expert Christopher Webb, said, "This new discovery is an important and unexpected addition to the numismatic history of 8th century England." <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/local/anglo-saxon-coin-goes-for-78-000-at-london-auction-1-6116507 |title=Anglo-Saxon coin goes for £78,000 at London auction |newspaper=[[Eastbourne Herald]] |access-date=14 June 2014}}</ref>

=== Norman era ===
Following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], the [[Hundred (country subdivision)|Hundred]] of what is now Eastbourne, was held by [[Robert, Count of Mortain]], [[William I of England|William the Conqueror's]] half brother. The [[Domesday Book]] lists 28&nbsp;ploughlands, a church, a watermill, fisheries and salt pans.<ref name=WHITEFIELD>{{Citation|last=Whitefield-Smith|first=N.|title=Eastbourne – A history & celebration|publisher=Frith Book Company Ltd |year=2004|isbn=978-1-904938-24-8}}</ref>

The Book referred to the area as 'Borne'. 'East' was added to 'Borne' in the 13th century, renaming the town.<ref name="eastbourne.gov.uk" />

[[File:St. Mary's Church, Old Town.JPG|thumb|left|St Mary's Church, Old Town, Eastbourne]]

=== Medieval era ===
A charter for a weekly market was granted to Bartholomew de Badlesmere in 1315–16; this increased his status as Lord of the Manor and improved local industry.<ref name=STEVENSSHE>{{harvnb|Stevens|1987}}</ref> During the Middle Ages the town was visited by [[Henry I of England|King Henry&nbsp;I]] and in 1324 by [[Edward II of England|Edward&nbsp;II]].<ref name=WRIGHT /> Evidence of Eastbourne's medieval past can seen in the 12th century Church of St Mary,<ref name="stmary">{{cite web | url=http://www.stmaryseastbourne.com/6.html | title=St Mary the Virgin, Old Town | publisher=Eastbourne Parish Church | access-date=16 May 2013}}</ref> and the manor house called Bourne Place.

In the mid-16th century Bourne Place was home to the Burton family,<ref name=BMA>{{Citation|title=The book of Eastbourne|publisher=Produced for the 99th annual meeting of the British Medical Association|year=1931|location=Eastbourne}}</ref> who acquired much of the land on which the present town stands. This manor house is currently owned by the [[Duke of Devonshire]] and was extensively remodelled in the early [[Georgian era]] when it was renamed [[Compton Place]]. It is one of the two Grade I [[listed buildings]] in the town.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/EasySiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=51326&type=full&servicetype=Inline | title = Listed Buildings | access-date =12 July 2011 | date = July 2004 | work=Eastbourne Townscape Guide | publisher=Eastbourne Borough Council}}</ref>

Eastbourne has Cornish connections, most notably visible in the Cornish [[high cross]] in the churchyard of St Mary's Church which was brought from an unspecified location in Cornwall.<ref name="Stevens p. 14" /><ref>Plaque at foot of cross</ref>

=== Georgian era ===
In 1752, a dissertation by Doctor [[Richard Russell (doctor)|Richard Russell]] extolled the medicinal benefits of the seaside. His views were of considerable benefit to the south coast and, in due course, Eastbourne became known as "the Empress of Watering Places".<ref name= SURTEES>{{Citation|last=Surtees|first=Dr John|title= Eastbourne, A History|place=Chichester|publisher=Phillimore|year=2002|isbn=978-1-86077-226-9}}</ref>

Eastbourne's earliest claim as a seaside resort came about following a summer holiday visit by four of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]'s children in 1780 (Princes [[Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Edward]] and [[Prince Octavius of Great Britain|Octavius]] and Princesses [[Princess Elizabeth of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Sophia of the United Kingdom|Sophia]]).<ref>{{Citation|last=Royer ''(attrib.)''|first=James.|title=East-bourne and its Environs|year=1787}}</ref>

In 1793, following a survey of coastal defences in the southeast, approval was given for the positioning of infantry and artillery to defend the bay between Beachy Head and Hastings from attack by the French. Fourteen [[Martello Tower]]s were constructed along the western shore of [[Pevensey Bay]], continuing as far as Tower&nbsp;73, the Wish Tower at Eastbourne. Several of these towers survive: the Wish Tower is an important feature of the town's seafront and was the subject of a painting by [[James Sant]] RA,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/sant_artist/21795497942/|title=The Wish Tower, Eastbourne|website=Flickr.com|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref> and part of Tower&nbsp;68 forms the basement of a house on St.&nbsp;Antony's Hill. Between 1805 and 1807, the construction took place of a fortress known as the [[Eastbourne Redoubt]], which was built as a barracks and storage depot, and armed with 10&nbsp;cannons.<ref name=ROSEMARY>{{Citation|last1=Milton|first1=Rosemary|last2=Callaghan|first2=Richard|title=The Redoubt Fortress and Martello Towers of Eastbourne 1804–2004|place=Eastbourne|publisher=Eastbourne Local History Society|year=2005|isbn=978-0-9547647-0-8}}</ref>

A connection with India comes in the shape of the 18th-century Lushington monument, also at St&nbsp;Mary's, which commemorates a survivor of the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]] atrocity which led to the British conquest of [[Bengal]].

Eastbourne remained an area of small rural settlements until the 19th&nbsp;century.

Four villages or hamlets occupied the site of the modern town: Bourne (or, to distinguish it from others of the same name, East Bourne), is now known as Old Town, and this surrounded the bourne (stream) which rises in the present Motcombe Park; Meads, where the Downs meet the coast; South Bourne (near the town hall); and the fishing settlement known simply as Sea Houses, which was situated to the east of the present pier.<ref name=ROSEMARY />

=== Victorian era ===
By the mid-19th century most of the area had fallen into the hands of two landowners: [[John Davies Gilbert]] (the [[Davies-Gilbert]] family still own much of the land in Eastbourne and [[East Dean and Friston|East Dean]]) and [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|William Cavendish]], Earl of Burlington.<ref name="Stevens p. 14">{{harvnb|Stevens|1987|p=14}}</ref>

The Gilbert family's holdings date to the late 17th and early 18th centuries when barrister Nicholas Gilbert married an Eversfield and Gildredge heiress.<ref>"Gildredge, an ancient house and estate", says Sussex historian Mark Antony Lower, "gave name to a family of considerable antiquity, who subsequently had their chief residence at Eastbourne, and gave their name to the manor of Eastbourne-Gildredge."</ref> (The Gildredges owned much of Eastbourne by 1554. The Gilberts eventually made the Gildredge Manor House their own. Today the Gildredge name lives on in the eponymous park.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=179-gilbert&cid=0 |title=Archive of the Davies-Gilbert Family of Eastbourne, East Sussex, East Sussex Record Office, the National Archives |publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |access-date=10 July 2011}}</ref>

[[Trevithick]], the inventor of the steam locomotive (a claim disputed on the grave of one Vyvyan in the churchyard at [[Camborne]]), is reported to have spent some time here.<ref>Arthur Mee, editor, ''King's England: Sussex'' 1930s edition</ref>

An early plan, for a town named Burlington, was abandoned, but on 14 May 1849 the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] arrived to scenes of great jubilation. With the arrival of the railway, the town's growth accelerated.

Cavendish, now the 7th&nbsp;[[Duke of Devonshire]], recruited [[Henry Currey (architect)|Henry Currey]] in 1859 to lay out a plan for what was essentially an entire new town – a resort built "for gentlemen by gentlemen". The town grew rapidly from a population of less than 4,000 in 1851 to nearly 35,000 by 1891. In 1883, it was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]]; a purpose-built town hall was opened in 1886.<ref name=SURTEES /> This period of growth and elegant development continued for several decades. A royal visit by
[[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] and Queen Mary in March 1935 is commemorated by a plaque on chalet number 2 at Holywell.<ref name="Spears 1981">{{cite book|last1=Spears|first1=Harold|last2=Stevens|first2=Lawrence|last3=Crook|first3=Richard|last4=Hodsoll|first4=Vera|year =1981|title=Eight Town Walks in Eastbourne|place=Eastbourne|publisher=Eastbourne Civic Society}}</ref>

=== 20th century ===
During the [[First World War]], Summerdown Camp, a convalescent facility, opened in 1915 near the South Downs to treat soldiers who were injured during trench warfare or seriously ill. It was the largest of this type in the UK during this war, treating 150,000; 80% were able to return to fight. The facility was dismantled in 1920. An exhibition about the history of the camp was held in Eastbourne for several months in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-32133099|title=WW1 camp re-equipped soldiers for war|first=Nick|last=Tarver|date=7 April 2015|website=Bbc.com}}</ref>

In 1926, the Eastbourne Corporation Act enabled the creation of the [[Eastbourne Downland Estate]].

The [[Second World War]] saw a change in fortunes.<ref name=OCKENDEN /> Initially, children were evacuated to Eastbourne on the assumption that they would be safe from German bombs, but soon they had to be evacuated again because after the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in June 1940 it was anticipated that the town would lie in an invasion zone.<ref>{{harvnb|Stevens|1987|p=28}}</ref> Part of [[Operation Sea Lion]], the German invasion plan, envisaged landings at Eastbourne.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Ramsey | first1 = Winston G. | title = The Blitz – Then and Now | volume = 1 |editor= Winston G.

In the summer of 1956, the town came to national and worldwide attention,<ref name=CULLEN>{{Citation|last=Cullen|first=Pamela V.|title=A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams|publisher=Elliott & Thompson|year=2006|location=London|isbn=978-1-904027-19-5}}</ref> when [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams]], a [[general practitioner]] serving the town's wealthier patients, was arrested for the murder of an [[Edith Alice Morrell|elderly widow]].

After the war, development continued, including the growth of Old Town up the hillside (Green Street Farm Estate) and the housing estates of [[Hampden Park, East Sussex|Hampden Park]], Willingdon Trees and [[Langney]]. During the latter half of the 20th century, there were controversies over the demolition of Pococks, a 15th-century manor house on what is now the Rodmill Housing Estate, and the granting of planning permission for a 19-storey block at the western end of the seafront. The latter project (South Cliff Tower) was realised in 1965 despite a storm of protest led by the newly formed Eastbourne and District Preservation Committee, which later became Eastbourne Civic Society, and was renamed the Eastbourne Society in 1999. Local conservationists also failed to prevent the construction of the glass-plated [[TGWU]] conference and holiday centre (the building now operating as The View Hotel), but were successful in purchasing [[Polegate Windmill]], thus saving it from demolition and redevelopment.<ref name="Spears 1981" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbournesociety.co.uk/page2/page2.html |title=About us |access-date=9 May 2010 |last=Clack |first=Mavis |date=January 2007 |publisher=The Eastbourne Society |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430070645/http://www.eastbournesociety.co.uk/page2/page2.html |archive-date = 30 April 2008}}</ref> Most of the expansion took place on the northern and eastern margins of the town, gradually swallowing surrounding villages. However, the richer western part was constrained by the Downs and has remained largely unchanged. In 1981, a large section of the town centre was replaced by the indoor shops of the [[Arndale Centre]].

In the 1990s, both growth and controversy accelerated rapidly as a new plan was launched to develop the area known as the Crumbles, a shingle bank on the coast to the east of the town centre. This area, now known as [[Sovereign Harbour]], containing a marina, shops and several thousand houses, along with luxury flats, was formerly home to many rare plants. There has been continued growth in other parts of the town, and the central marshland has become farmland and nature reserves.

In 2016–19 extensive remodelling work was undertaken to the prominent Arndale Centre, which takes up most of the town centre, and was originally built by Legal & General Assurance in the 1980s. This was then renamed The Beacon. The remodelling including the addition of a brand new cinema run by Cineworld.

=== Local History Society ===<!--[[Eastbourne Local History Society]] redirects here-->
Eastbourne Local History Society was founded in 1970. It is a charitable, [[not-for-profit]] organisation in the [[United Kingdom]] whose objective is the pursuit and encouragement of an active interest in the study of the history of Eastbourne and its immediate environs and the dissemination of the outcome of such studies.<ref>{{Citation|title=Eastbourne Local History Society|url=http://www.eastbournehistory.org.uk/|access-date=11 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title= Local history societies in Sussex|publisher= The Local History Press Ltd|url= http://www.local-history.co.uk/Groups/sussex.html|access-date=11 February 2010}}</ref>

As the major landowner, the Cavendish family has had strong connections with Eastbourne since the 18th century. The current President of the Society is [[William Cavendish, Earl of Burlington]].

Containing over 1,500 articles about the history of Eastbourne, the Society's indexed journal, ''The Eastbourne Local Historian'', is the major historical resource for the town and has been published quarterly since its inception in 1970.<ref>{{Citation|title=Local Resources|publisher=Eastbourne Borough Council|url= http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/eastbourne/history/family-history/local-resources/|access-date=11 February 2010}}</ref> Over the years, the Society has published various books and booklets about the history of Eastbourne, twelve of which are currently in print.

== Geography ==

{{Wide image|Eastbourne Panorama, England - May 2009.jpg|900px|Panoramic view of Eastbourne, as seen from the west on Beachy Head}}

The [[South Downs]] dominate Eastbourne and the [[Eastbourne Downland Estate]] can be seen from most of the town. These were originally chalk deposits laid down under the sea during the [[Late Cretaceous]], and were later lifted by the same [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] movements that formed the European Alps, during the middle Tertiary period.<ref name=BMA /> The chalk can be clearly seen along the eroded coastline to the west of the town, in the area known as [[Beachy Head]] and the [[Seven Sisters, Sussex|Seven Sisters]], where continuous erosion keeps the cliff edge vertical and white. The chalk contains many fossils such as [[ammonites]] and [[nautilus]]. The town area is built on geologically recent [[Alluvium|alluvial]] drift, the result of the silting up of a bay. This changes to [[Weald]] clay around the [[Langney]] estate.<ref name=BMA />

A part of the South Downs, [[Willingdon Down]] is a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]]. This is of archaeological interest due to a Neolithic camp and burial grounds. The area is also a nationally uncommon tract of chalk grassland rich in species.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002260.pdf |title=County: East Sussex Site Name: Willingdon Down |access-date=10 July 2011 |publisher=English Nature |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024021102/http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002260.pdf |archive-date=24 October 2012 }}</ref> Another SSSI which partially falls with the Eastbourne district is [[Seaford to Beachy Head]]. This site, of biological and geological interest, covers the coastline between Eastbourne and Seaford, plus the Seven Sisters country park and the Cuckmere valley.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002008.pdf | title = County: East Sussex, Site Name: Seaford to Beachy Head | access-date =10 July 2011 | publisher=English Nature}}</ref> Several nature trails lead across the Downs to areas such as the nearby villages of [[East Dean and Friston|East Dean]] and [[Birling Gap]], and landmarks like the Seven Sisters, [[Belle Tout Lighthouse]] and Beachy Head.

=== Districts ===
[[File:Grove Road, Eastbourne.jpg|upright|thumb|Grove Road, part of the Little Chelsea area of Eastbourne]]

Eastbourne's greater area comprises the town of [[Polegate]], and the civil parishes of [[Willingdon and Jevington]], [[Stone Cross]], [[Pevensey]], [[Westham]] and Pevensey Bay village. All are part of the [[Wealden District|Wealden]] District. Within Eastbourne's limits are:

* ''[[Langney]]'': Langney Rise, [[Shinewater]], Kingsmere, Langney Village, the Marina, Langney Point
* ''[[Hampden Park, East Sussex|Hampden Park]]'': Hampden Park Village, Willingdon Trees, Winkney Farm, Ratton
* ''Inner areas'': Rodmill, [[Ocklynge]], Seaside, Bridgemere, Roselands, Downside
* ''Town centre'': Town centre, Little Chelsea, [[Meads]], [[Holywell, Eastbourne|Holywell]], Old Town, Upperton
* ''[[Sovereign Harbour]]'': North Harbour, South Harbour

There was a community known as Norway, Eastbourne in the triangle now bounded by Wartling Road, Seaside and Lottbridge Drove. The name being a corruption of North Way,<ref name=ORIGINS>{{Citation|last=Milton|first=John T.|title=Origins of Eastbourne's Street Names|place=Eastbourne|publisher=Eastbourne Local History Society|year=1995|edition=pamphlet|isbn=978-0-9504560-6-5}}</ref> as this was the route to the north. The area is now a housing estate and the only evidence there was a Norway are a Norway Road and the local church whose sign reads "St&nbsp;Andrew's Church, Norway".

The former fishing [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Holywell, Eastbourne|Holywell]] (local pronunciation 'holly well') was situated by the cliff on a ledge some 400 yards to the southwest of the public garden known as the Holywell Retreat. It was approached from what is now Holywell Road via the lane between the present Helen Gardens and St&nbsp;Bede's School which leads to the chalk pinnacle formerly known locally as 'Gibraltar' or the 'Sugar Loaf'.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/28/keithperry|title=Five teenagers hurt as car plunges over 150ft cliff|first=Keith|last=Perry|date=28 June 2000|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref> The ground around the pinnacle was the site of [[lime kiln]]s also worked by the fishermen.<ref name=ELHS31>{{cite magazine|magazine=Eastbourne Local History Society Newsletter|title=Lime kilns|date=March 1979|issue=31}}</ref> The fishing hamlet at Holywell was taken over by the local water board in 1896<ref name=FRITHIM /> to exploit the springs in the cliffs. The water board's successors still own the site, and there is a pumping station but little evidence of the hamlet itself, as by now even most of the foundations of the cottages have gone over the cliff.<ref name=ELHS91>{{cite magazine|magazine=Eastbourne Local History Society Newsletter|title=Holywell|date=March 1979|issue=91}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
As with the rest of the [[British Isles]] and South Coast, Eastbourne experiences a [[maritime climate]] with cool summers and mild winters. The local climate is notable for its high sunshine levels, at least relative to much of the rest of England – Eastbourne holds the record for the highest recorded amount of sunshine in a month, 383.9&nbsp;hours in July 1911.<ref>{{Citation |title=UK Weather Records |publisher=UK Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/extremes/ |access-date=27 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403174157/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/extremes/ |archive-date=3 April 2012 }}</ref> Temperature extremes recorded at Eastbourne since 1960 range from {{convert|31.6|C|F}} during July 1976,<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=13&year=1976&indexid=TXx&stationid=1864 | title = 1976 temperature}}</ref> down to {{convert|−9.7|C|F}} In January 1987.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=7&year=1987&indexid=TNn&stationid=1864 | title = 1987 temperature}}</ref> Eastbourne's coastal location also means it tends to be milder than most areas, particularly during night. A whole six months of the year have never fallen below 0&nbsp;°C (32&nbsp;°F), and in July the temperature has never fallen below {{convert|8.3|C|F}}. All temperature figures relate to the period 1960 onwards. The [[Köppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is "[[Köppen climate classification#GROUP C: Mild Temperate/mesothermal climates|Cfb]]" (Marine West Coast Climate/[[Oceanic climate]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=591091&cityname=Eastbourne%2C+England%2C+United+Kingdom&units=|title=Travel Weather Averages (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase.com}}</ref>

Eastbourne is home to companies in a wide range of industries.<ref>{{cite web|title=East Sussex in Figures|url=http://www.eastsussexinfigures.org.uk/webview/index.jsp?mode=area&submode=result&areaname=eastbourne&areatype=LA|work=Eastbourne Economy Profile|publisher=East Sussex County Council|access-date=23 October 2013}}</ref> Eastbourne's Chamber of Commerce has more than 500 members and holds many networking events to facilitate local business links.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eastbourne and District Chamber of Commerce Ltd|url=http://www.eastbourneunltd.co.uk/|access-date=23 October 2013}}</ref>

In 2008, Eastbourne was judged to have low productivity, in a national assessment by the National Audit Office.<ref>Annual Business Inquiry, UK National Audit Office (2008)</ref> Productivity, measured by [[gross value added]] per employee, was recorded as £31,390 per year. This compared unfavourably with the South East overall, where GVA was £40,460 per employee per year. A possible explanation for this is that a high proportion of workers are in sectors which have relatively low productivity and wages.<ref>East Sussex Local Transport Plan 2011–2026, East Sussex County Council (2011)</ref>

In recent years, five areas within Eastbourne have regularly featured in the most economically deprived 10% in all of England. Measured as Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs), two areas within Devonshire ward, two areas within Hampden Park, and one area within Langney, are all among the most deprived LSOAs in the country. Three quarters of LSOAs in the town (45 LSOAs or 76%) had a worse ranking for deprivation in 2010 than in 2007.<ref>Indices of Multiple Deprivation (East Sussex in Figures), UK Department for Communities & Local Government, 2010</ref>

=== Technology and creative sectors ===

In 2016, UK innovation charity NESTA named Eastbourne as a "creative cluster", with 969 creative firms representing 9.1% of total businesses in the town and providing employment for 2,703 people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/local/eastbourne-s-a-hotspot-for-creative-industries-says-report-1-7518904|title=Eastbourne Herald|date=9 August 2016|website=Eastbourneherald.co.uk|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref>

=== Tourism sector ===

[[File:Eastbourne Pier, East Sussex, England 20June2018 arp.jpg|thumb|[[Eastbourne Pier]] in June 2018]]
The seafront at Eastbourne consists almost entirely of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] hotels. Along with its [[Eastbourne Pier|pier]] and [[bandstand]], this serves to preserve the front in a somewhat timeless manner.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/EasySiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=226&type=full&servicetype=Inline | title = Eastbourne's Story | access-date = 10 July 2011 | publisher = Eastbourne Borough Council | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928031242/http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/EasysiteWeb/getresource.axd?AssetID=226&type=full&servicetype=Inline | archive-date = 28 September 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Duke of Devonshire]] retains the rights{{clarify|date=June 2016}} to the seafront buildings and does not allow them to be developed into shops.<ref name=FRITHIM>{{Citation|title=Eastbourne, an Illustrated Miscellany|place=Salisbury, Shropshire|publisher=Frith Book Company|year=2004|isbn=978-1-904938-79-8}}</ref>

A stretch of {{convert|4|mi|km}} of shingle beach stretches from [[Sovereign Harbour]] in the east to [[Beachy Head]] in the west. In a 1998 survey, 56% of visitors said that the beach and seafront was one of Eastbourne's best features, although 10% listed the pebbled beach as a dislike.<ref name=TOURISM>{{citation|title=Tourism Study: Visitor Profile & Economic Impact|publisher=Report commissioned by Eastbourne Borough Council|year=1998}}</ref>

Other recreation facilities include two swimming pools, three fitness centres and other smaller sports clubs including [[scuba diving]].

A children's adventure park is sited at the eastern end of the seafront. There are various other establishments scattered around the town such as [[crazy golf]], [[Kart racing|go–karting]] and [[Laser Quest]]. The pier is an obvious place to visit and is sometimes used to hold events, such as the international [[Birdman Rally|birdman]] competition held annually, although this was cancelled in 2005 due to a lack of competitors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4722897.stm|work=BBC News |title=No 'birds' means Birdman scrapped|date=28 July 2005|access-date=24 June 2007}}</ref> An annual raft competition used to take place where competitors, usually local businesses, circumnavigate the pier in a raft made by themselves, while being attacked by a water-cannon.

A major event in the tourist programme of [[Eastbourne Borough Council]] is [[Eastbourne Airbourne]], a large air show, held annually in August.

Reports claim a £365m revenue from visitors in 2010, with an estimated 7,160 jobs supported by tourism.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Economic Impact of Tourism Eastbourne 2010|url=http://mediafiles.thedms.co.uk/Publication/ES/cms/pdf/Eastbourne%20Tourism-Economic-Impact-2010.pdf|publisher=Tourism South East|access-date=23 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194617/http://mediafiles.thedms.co.uk/Publication/ES/cms/pdf/Eastbourne%20Tourism-Economic-Impact-2010.pdf|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Large employers ===

The town is home to the UK's largest book wholesalers, who have a 350,000 sq ft warehouse facility there. Gardners Books are one of the town's largest employers, with a majority of staff involved in packing and shipping books.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gardners.com/|title=Gardners – Gardners Books|website=Gardners.com}}</ref>

A majority of Eastbourne's total employment is offered by small private businesses, though [[Eastbourne District General Hospital]] is a significant public sector employer.

In 2010, it was assessed that Eastbourne had a public sector employment rate of 25.4% of overall jobs. This was noted as below average, compared with the UK as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/nov/21/public-sector-employment-uk-map|title=The public sector employment map of the UK: the full data|first=Simon|last=Rogers|date=21 November 2011|website=the Guardian}}</ref>

=== Electricity supply ===
''Eastbourne Electric Light Co.'' started up on 4 September 1882 illuminating The Parades with 22 [[Brush Traction|Brush]] arc lamps.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=The Electricity Council|title=Electricity Supply in the United Kingdom: a Chronology|publisher=The Electricity Council|year=1987|isbn=085188105X|location=London|pages=22}}</ref> Several large shops were lit with incandescent lamps powered from generators located at the Bedfordwell waterworks. An [[alternating current]] system was introduced in 1883, from a generating plant at The Old Brewery in Junction Road. By 1888 there were 1,700 lamps on the system; a new generating plant was added in 1899 including 30 [[Watt|kW]], 75&nbsp;kW, 100&nbsp;kW, 50&nbsp;kW, 150&nbsp;kW and 200&nbsp;kW generators. There were five circuits distributing electricity around the town through rubber insulated cables. After a few years the rubber deteriorated and faults were frequent. The ''Eastbourne Corporation'' purchased the undertaking on 1 January 1900 and the original Electricity Works was closed down in July 1902.<ref name=":0" />

''Eastbourne County Borough Corporation'' began construction of Eastbourne power station in the first decade of the twentieth century. It supplied electricity, firstly for street lighting then other uses. The station had a single brick chimney and three wooden cooling towers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/28976636@N07/12477285294|title=Eastbourne past ~1930s electricity works and desructor|website=Flickr|access-date=3 February 2020}}</ref> Upon nationalisation of the electricity industry in 1948 ownership of the station passed to the British Electricity Authority and then to the Central Electricity Generating Board. In 1954 the station generated 2,652 MWh of electricity and burned 3,500 tons of coal.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=24 June 1954|title=Schedule of power stations as at 31 December 1954|journal=Electrical Review|volume=June 1955|pages=1123}}</ref> In 1966 the power station had a generating capacity of 9.0 MW and delivered 3,165 MWh of electricity.<ref>''CEGB Statistical  Yearbook 1966'', CEGB, London</ref> The CEGB later closed the station and it was subsequently demolished.

[[File:Devonshire Park Theatre.jpg|thumb|left|[[Devonshire Park Theatre]], completed in 1884.]]

=== Towner Art Gallery ===
The [[Towner Art Gallery]] is Eastbourne's principal arts gallery and arts education hub. After being located for many years in Eastbourne Manor House, within Gildredge Park, it relocated next to the Congress Theatre in 2009. The gallery holds one of the most important collections of public art in southern England.

=== Theatres ===
Eastbourne has three council-owned theatres: the Grade II* [[Listed building|listed]]<ref>{{NHLE |num=1323698 |desc=Congress Theatre |accessdate=13 January 2007}}</ref> [[Congress Theatre (Eastbourne)|Congress Theatre]], the Grade II listed [[Devonshire Park Theatre]] and the Grade II listed Winter Garden. The Grade II listed [[Royal Hippodrome Theatre]] used to be council-owned, but is now run by an independent charitable trust.

The Devonshire Park Theatre is a fine example of a Victorian theatre with ornate interior decorations, and plays host to touring dramas and comedies and an annual local [[pantomime]]. The Royal Hippodrome has the longest running summer show in Britain.<ref>{{Citation|title=Eastbourne Borough Council – Theatres |url=http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/leisure/theatres |access-date=7 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527032351/http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/leisure/theatres/ |archive-date=27 May 2013 }}</ref> The [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] makes regular appearances and has an annual season at the Congress Theatre.

Other theatre venues in the town include the volunteer-run Underground Theatre, in the basement of the town's Central Library,<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.undergroundtheatre.org.uk/index.html|title=About the Under Ground Theatre|access-date=18 July 2011|publisher=Eastbourne Arts Centre}}</ref> and the [[Lamb Theatre]], based at the Lamb Inn in Old Town, which was launched in August 2009 but reinstated an older tradition at the pub.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/entertainment/Oldest-town-inn-begins-new.5533723.jp|title=Oldest town inn begins new life as theatre|access-date=16 October 2009|newspaper=[[Eastbourne Herald]]}}</ref>

=== Cinemas ===
Eastbourne had two cinemas: the Curzon Cinema and [[Cineworld]]. The Curzon Cinema was a small, family-run, independent cinema in Langney Road, in the town centre, which closed in January 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/people/eastbourne-curzon-cinema-announces-it-will-close-next-year-927341|title=Curzon to close in 2020|website=Easbourneherald.co.uk|access-date=23 January 2020}}</ref> Cineworld is a large [[Multiplex cinema]] with eight screens, in the Beacon shopping centre.

In 2013, the owners of the Curzon Cinema declared themselves "shocked" at the threats to their venue from a newly announced eight-screen multiplex, to be built in a renovated Arndale Centre nearby (the Centre has been renamed as The Beacon).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/curzon-owner-shocked-by-plans-for-multiplex-cinema-1-5748060|title=Curzon owner 'shocked' by plans for multiplex cinema|website=Eastbourneherald.co.uk|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref>

=== Music venues ===
[[Eastbourne Bandstand]] lies on the seafront, between the Wish Tower and the pier. It stages 1812 Firework Concerts, [[Rock and roll|Rock N Roll]] nights, [[Big Band]] concerts, [[Promenade concert]]s and [[tribute band]]s.

There was once a second similar bandstand (also built in 1935) in the 'music gardens' near the Redoubt Fortress. The bandstand was removed to make way for the Pavilion Tearooms but the colonnades built around it are still there (behind the tea rooms). Before 1935 each of these sites had a smaller "birdcage" bandstand; the one in the music gardens having been moved from a rather precarious position opposite the Albion Hotel. The kiosk in the music gardens was originally one of the toll kiosks at the entrance to the pier.<ref name=WHITEFIELD />

Grove Road is the location of two independent record shops and a venue called Printer's Playhouse (which hosts performances of live music and new plays).

=== Media ===
Former local radio station [[107.5 Sovereign Radio|Sovereign FM]] is now [[More Radio Eastbourne]], broadcasting to Eastbourne from studios in Worthing.<ref>{{Citation|title=Sovereign Radio, Eastbourne|url=http://www.mediauk.com/radio/194/107.5-sovereign-radio|publisher=Media-UK|access-date=26 April 2008}}</ref>
Regional radio stations, [[Heart Sussex]], (previously Southern FM) has, since mid 2019, been networked from London and  no longer has a [[Sussex]] base, which was previously in [[Portslade]] and [[BBC Sussex]] which broadcasts from [[Brighton]].

[[BBC]] ''[[South East Today]]'' and ''[[ITV Meridian]]'' are the two regional news channels.

=== Depictions in popular culture ===
The seafront and the iconic cliff at Beachy Head has been used for many scenes in feature films, and the local council set up a film liaison unit to encourage and facilitate the shooting of film sequences in and around the town.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/eastbourne/film/ | title = Film Liaison | access-date =10 July 2011 | publisher=Eastbourne Borough Council}}</ref> The 2006 [[Academy Award]]-nominated film ''[[Notes on a Scandal (film)|Notes on a Scandal]]'' includes scenes filmed at Beachy Head, Cavendish Hotel and 117&nbsp;Royal Parade.

Television too has used Eastbourne as a backdrop. The series ''[[Little Britain]]'' had the character [[Emily Howard (Little Britain)|Emily Howard]] strolling along the promenade. Other brief appearances were made in the television series ''[[Agatha Christie's Marple]]'', ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'', ''[[French and Saunders]]'' and ''[[Foyle's War]]''. A sequence of sketches that appear in each episode of ''[[Bang, Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer]]'', was shot in the old Jo Pip's / Cunninghams theatre venue on Seaside Road, which has since been developed into flats. The 1993 BBC drama series ''[[Westbeach]]'' was filmed on location in Eastbourne and surrounding areas.

The elderly female residents of Eastbourne were the inspiration for the song "Eastbourne Ladies" by English singer [[Kevin Coyne]], which appeared on his 1973 album ''[[Marjory Razorblade]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/tracks/nn3r4c|title=Eastbourne Ladies – Kevin Coyne Song – BBC Music|website=BBC|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/5qvh |title=Music – Review of Kevin Coyne – Marjory Razorblade |publisher=BBC |access-date=12 August 2014}}</ref>

=== Beachy Head and the Downs ===
{{Main|Beachy Head|Eastbourne Downs}}
The [[Eastbourne Downland]] provides a spectacular backdrop to the town. The 4,000 acres of farmland and downland are owned by the town of Eastbourne, following the 1926 Eastbourne Corporation Act, which aimed to protect their unspoilt beauty "in perpetuity".

The Eastbourne Downs include [[Beachy Head]] cliff, to the west of the town, a famous beauty spot and an infamous suicide spot. Statistics are not officially published to reduce suicidal mimicry,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gunnell|first=D.|year=1994|title=Reporting Suicide – The effect of media coverage on patterns of self harm|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=308|issue=6941|pages=1446–47|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/308/6941/1446|doi=10.1136/bmj.308.6941.1446|s2cid=71591905}}</ref> but unofficial statistics show it to be the third most common suicide spot.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hunt|first=Tom|year=2006|title=Cliffs of Despair: A Journey to the Edge|publisher=Random House|isbn =978-0-375-50715-1}}</ref>

The lighthouse at the foot of the cliff came into operation in October 1902. Although originally manned by two keepers, it has been remotely monitored by [[Trinity House]] via a landline since June 1983. Prior to its construction, shipping had been warned by the [[Belle Tout Lighthouse]] on the cliff top some {{convert|1640|yards|m}} to the west. Belle Tout Lighthouse was operational from 1834 to 1902, and closed because its light was not visible in mist and low cloud. It became a private residence, but was severely damaged in the Second World War by Canadian artillery.<ref>{{Citation|last=Surtees|first=Dr John|year=1997|title=Beachy Head|place=Seaford|publisher=SB Publications|isbn=978-1-85770-118-0}}</ref> In 1956, it was rebuilt as a house and remains a dwelling to this day.

=== Eastbourne Pier ===
{{Main|Eastbourne Pier}}
Eastbourne Pier was built between 1866 and 1872 at the junction of Grand and Marine Parades. The pier interrupts what would otherwise have been a ribbon development of buildings – to the west, high-class hotels, with modest family hotels and boarding houses to the east.<ref name="crook10">{{cite magazine|title=Eastbourne Pier – Past, present and future|magazine=The Eastbourne Society Observer|date=Spring 2010|first=Richard|last=Crook|issue=182|page=10}}</ref> The Eastbourne Pier Company was registered in April 1865 with a capital of £15,000<ref>{{cite book | last = Surtees | first = Dr John | title = Eastbourne – a history | publisher=Phillimore | year = 2002 | location = Chichester | page = 134 |isbn = 978-1-86077-226-9 }}</ref> and on 18 April 1866 work began. It was opened by [[Lord Edward Cavendish]] on 13 June 1870, although it was not actually completed until two years later. On New Year's Day 1877 the landward half was swept away in a storm. It was rebuilt at a higher level, creating a drop towards the end of the pier. The pier is effectively built on stilts that rest in cups on the sea-bed allowing the whole structure to move during rough weather. It is roughly 300&nbsp;metres (1000&nbsp;ft) long. A domed 400-seater pavilion was constructed at a cost of £250 at the seaward end in 1888. A 1,000-seater theatre, bar, [[camera obscura]] and office suite replaced this in 1899/1901. At the same time, two saloons were built midway along the pier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theheritagetrail.co.uk/piers/eastbourne%20pier.htm |title=English Seaside Piers – Eastbourne Pier |access-date=13 March 2010 |publisher=English Heritage Trail }}</ref> Access to the camera obscura was destroyed by an arson attack in 1970, but was restored in 2003 with a new stairway built.<ref name="crook10" />

Eastbourne Redoubt on Royal Parade is one of three examples of a type of fortress built to withstand potential invasion from Napoleon's forces in the early 19th century.<ref>{{Citation| url = http://www.eastbournemuseums.co.uk/OtherRedoubts.htm

== Education ==
Eastbourne's reputation for health, enhanced by bracing air and sea breezes contributed to the establishment of many independent schools in the 19th century and in 1871,<ref name=PETRIECAREW>{{Citation|last=Petrie Carew|first=Dorothea|title=Many Years Many Girls|place=Dublin|publisher=The Author|year=1967}}</ref> the year which saw the arrival of Queenwood Ladies College, the town was just beginning a period of growth and prosperity.<ref name= PETRIECAREW /> By 1896, Gowland's Eastbourne Directory listed 76&nbsp;private schools for boys and girls. However, economic difficulties during the inter-war years saw a gradual decline in the number of independent schools.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite magazine|magazine=Eastbourne Local History Society Newsletter|title=Independent Schools|issue=79}}</ref>

In 1930, the headmistress of [[Clovelly-Kepplestone]], a well-established boarding school for girls, referred to "heavy financial losses experienced by schools in the past few years".<ref name="ReferenceA" />  In 1930, this school was forced to merge its junior and senior departments; in 1931, one of its buildings was sold off, and in 1934 the school closed altogether. Finally, indicative of the changes that would later befall many of the larger buildings in the town,<ref>{{cite magazine | title = The First Years (30th anniversary publication) | magazine=Eastbourne Civic Society – the First Years | year = 1991}}</ref> the school was demolished to make way for a block of flats, which was completed in 1939.<ref name="ReferenceA" />

The Eastbourne (Blue Book) Directory for 1938 lists 39&nbsp;independent schools in the town. With the [[fall of France]] in June 1940, and the risk of invasion, most left – the majority never to return.<ref name=OCKENDEN /> By 2020, the number had reduced to just three: [[St Andrew's Prep|St. Andrew's Prep School]], [[Eastbourne College]] and [[St. Bede's Prep School|St.&nbsp;Bede's Preparatory School]]

Eastbourne has 6 state secondary schools, 17 state primary schools, 1 primary special school and 2 secondary special schools. Parts of the [[University of Brighton]] are based in the Meads area of the town. There are several language colleges and schools, with students coming mainly from Europe.<ref name=TOURISM />

[[East Sussex College]] is a large further education college with a campus in Eastbourne. This state-funded college provides a range of GCSE, GCE A Level, BTEC and vocational programmes for students aged 16–19 years of age, plus a full range of adult FE programmes. It originated from a 2001 merger between Lewes Tertiary College and Eastbourne College of Arts and Technology (ECAT) to form Sussex Downs College, which then took over Park College (the old Eastbourne Sixth Form college) in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sussexdowns.ac.uk/|title=Sussex Downs College – Welcome to Sussex Downs College|website=Sussexdowns.ac.uk|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref> In 2018, a further merger with Sussex Coast College in Hastings formed the current East Sussex College.

== Religious life ==
{{See also|List of places of worship in Eastbourne|List of demolished places of worship in East Sussex}}
As well as the medieval parish church of St Mary in Old Town, another remarkable church building in Eastbourne is the redbrick [[St Saviour's Church, Eastbourne|St Saviour's and St Peter's]]. Originally consecrated under the former name in 1872, it was designed by [[George Edmund Street]]<ref>{{harvnb|Stevens|1987|p=20}}</ref> but merged with St Peter's in 1971 when the latter was made redundant and demolished.

The tall flint tower of St&nbsp;Michael's at Ocklynge is one of Eastbourne's landmarks.

== Transport ==

Eastbourne is connected by road to London by the [[A22 road|A22]], and to [[Brighton and Hove]] and [[Hastings]] by the nearby [[A27 road|A27]]. The car is the most used form of transport in the town, with only 6% of journeys taken by bus; the local council transport plan aims to reduce the amount of car usage.<ref name=TRANSPORT>{{Citation|publisher=East Sussex County Council|title=Local Transport Plan 2006–2011|date=March 2006}}</ref> Bus services within Eastbourne have been provided by [[Stagecoach Group]] under the name [[Stagecoach in Eastbourne]] since November 2008, when the company acquired [[Eastbourne Buses]], a service [[municipal bus company|run by the local council]], and subsequently the independent company [[Cavendish Motor Services]].<ref name="EBusesSold">{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/Eastbourne-Buses-was-sold-for.4740549.jp|title=Eastbourne Buses was sold for £4million|publisher=TR Beckett Newspapers|access-date=29 November 2008|date=27 November 2008}}</ref> Eastbourne Buses had been formed in 1903 by the County Borough of Eastbourne, who were the first local authority in the world authorised to run motor buses.<ref>{{Citation|last=Spencer|first=Dave|year=1993|title=Eastbourne Bus Story| place=Midhurst|publisher=Middleton Press|isbn=978-1-873793-17-6}}</ref> As well as local journeys within the town, Stagecoach also runs routes to [[Polegate]], [[Hailsham]], [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], [[Uckfield]] and [[East Grinstead]] at various frequencies, while the two routes to [[Hastings]] via [[Bexhill-on-Sea|Bexhill]] are run by [[Stagecoach South East]] from Hastings. The other main operator into Eastbourne is [[Brighton & Hove (bus company)|Brighton & Hove]], owned by the [[Go-Ahead Group]], which runs frequent services seven days a week from [[Brighton]] via [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]] and [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]]. Limited numbers of additional buses are run by the [[Cuckmere Buses]], and a regular [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] coach service operates daily from London's [[Victoria Coach Station]].

The main [[Eastbourne railway station|railway station]] is situated in the town centre and is served by [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]]. The present station (the town's third), designed by F. D. Bannister, dates from 1886.<ref name=SURTEES /> It was originally on what was termed the ''Eastbourne Branch''<ref>''Handbook of Stations ... on the Railways of Great Britain and Ireland'' British Transport Commission (Railway Clearing House) 1956</ref> from [[Polegate railway station|Polegate]]. There was a rarely used triangular junction between Polegate and the now-closed ''Stone Cross'' which allowed trains to bypass the Branch; the track has now been lifted. Also on the erstwhile Branch is [[Hampden Park railway station]] to the north of the town. Regular services along the coast have invariably served Eastbourne. All trains, because of the layout, have to pass through Hampden Park once in each direction. This has the effect of making the Hampden Park level crossing very busy. Indeed, it is thought to be the busiest in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eastbourneherald.co.uk/news/Level-crossing-warnings-at-Hampden.5915776.jp |title=Level crossing warnings at Hampden Park |date=16 December 2009 |newspaper=[[Eastbourne Herald]] |publisher=Johnston Press Digital Publishing |access-date=3 June 2010}}</ref> Regular services are to London Victoria, [[Gatwick Airport]], [[Hastings]] and [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford International]] and a commuter service to Brighton.
