A '''biofuel''' is a [[fuel]] that is produced through contemporary processes from [[biomass]], rather than a fuel produced by the very slow geological processes involved in the formation of [[fossil fuel]]s, such as oil. Since [[biomass]] technically can be used as a fuel directly (e.g. wood logs), some people use the terms biomass and biofuel interchangeably. More often than not, however, the word biomass simply denotes the biological raw material the fuel is made of, or some form of thermally/chemically altered ''solid'' end product, like torrefied pellets or [[briquette]]s.  

The word biofuel is usually reserved for liquid or gaseous fuels, used for transportation. The [[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] (EIA) follows this naming practice.<ref>The IEA states: "Biofuels are transportation fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel that are made from biomass materials." https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.php?page=biofuel_home</ref> Drop-in biofuels are functionally equivalent to petroleum fuels and fully compatible with the existing petroleum infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Karatzos|first1=Sergios|url=http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf|title=The Potential and Challenges of Drop-in Biofuels|last2=McMillan|first2=James D.|last3=Saddler|first3=Jack N.|date=July 2014|publisher=IEA Bioenergy Task 39|isbn=978-1-910154-07-6|page=2|id=Report T39-T1|access-date=9 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112021600/http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf|archive-date=12 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> They require no engine modification of the vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Alternative Fuels Data Center: Renewable Hydrocarbon Biofuels|url=https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/emerging_hydrocarbon.html|website=afdc.energy.gov}}</ref>  

Biofuels can be produced from plants (i.e. [[energy crop]]s), or from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes (if the waste has a biological origin).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/biofuel.html|title=What is biofuel? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref> Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary [[carbon fixation]], such as those that occur in [[plants]] or [[microalgae]] through the process of [[photosynthesis]].  If the [[biomass]] used in the production of biofuel can regrow quickly, the fuel is generally considered to be a form of [[renewable energy]]. The [[greenhouse]] gas mitigation potential of biofuel varies considerably, from emission levels comparable to fossil fuels in some scenarios to negative emissions in others.

The two most common types of biofuel are bioethanol and biodiesel.

* [[Ethanol#Fuel|Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], or [[sweet sorghum]]. [[Cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form (E100), but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|United States]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]].
* [[Biodiesel]] is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe. It can be used as a [[fuel]] for vehicles in its pure form (B100), but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles.

In 2019, worldwide biofuel production reached 161&nbsp;billion liters (43&nbsp;billion gallons US), up 6% from 2018,<ref name="Transport biofuels">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Transport biofuels|url=https://www.iea.org/reports/transport-biofuels|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=IEA}}</ref> and biofuels provided 3% of the world's fuels for road transport. The [[International Energy Agency]] want biofuels to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050, in order to reduce dependency on petroleum.<ref name="Transport biofuels" /> However, the production and consumption of biofuels are not on track to meet the IEA's sustainable development scenario. From 2020 to 2030 global biofuel output has to increase by 10% each year to reach IEA's goal. Only 3% growth annually is expected the next 5 years.<ref name="Transport biofuels"/>

=== Fourth-generation biofuels ===
This class of biofuels includes [[Electrofuel|electrofuels]] and [[Solar fuel|solar fuels]]. [[Electrofuel|Electrofuels]] are made by storing [[electrical energy]] in the chemical bonds of liquids and gases. The primary targets are [[butanol]], [[biodiesel]], and [[Hydrogen fuel|hydrogen]], but include other alcohols and carbon-containing gases such as [[methane]] and [[butane]]. A solar fuel is a synthetic chemical [[fuel]] produced from solar energy. Light is converted to [[chemical energy]], typically by reducing [[protons]] to [[hydrogen]], or [[carbon dioxide]] to [[organic compounds]].

==Examples ==
The following fuels can be produced using first, second, third or fourth-generation biofuel production procedures. Most of these can be produced using two or three of the different biofuel generation procedures.<ref>Ethanol for instance can be produced using 1G, 2G and 3G procedures</ref>

===Biogas===
[[File:Biogas.jpg|thumb|Biogas]]
[[File:Biogas pipes.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Pipes carrying biogas|alt=]]
{{Main|Biogas}}
Biogas is [[methane]] produced by the process of [[anaerobic digestion]] of [[organic material]] by [[anaerobe]]s.<ref>Redman, G., The Andersons Centre. [https://web.archive.org/web/20081004232058/http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/metadot/index.pl?id=7198%3Bisa%3DDBRow%3Bop%3Dshow%3Bdbview_id%3D2457 "Assessment of on-farm AD in the UK"], ''[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]'', 9 June 2008. Retrieved 2009-05-11.</ref> It can be produced either from [[biodegradable waste]] materials or by the use of [[energy crop]]s fed into [[anaerobic digester]]s to supplement gas yields. The solid byproduct, [[digestate]], can be used as a biofuel or a fertilizer.

Biogas can be recovered from [[mechanical biological treatment]] waste processing systems. [[Landfill gas]], a less clean form of biogas, is produced in [[landfill]]s through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion. If it escapes into the atmosphere, it is a potential{{Clarify|reason=why "potential"?|date=October 2020}} [[greenhouse gas]].

Farmers can produce biogas from [[manure]] from their cattle by using anaerobic digesters.<ref>"BIOGAS: No bull, manure can power your farm." Farmers Guardian (25 September 2009): 12. General OneFile. Gale.</ref>

===Syngas===

{{Main|Gasification}}
[[Syngas]], a mixture of [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen]] and other hydrocarbons, is produced by partial combustion of biomass, that is, combustion with an amount of [[oxygen]] that is not sufficient to convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide and water.<ref name="evans"/> Before partial combustion, the biomass is dried, and sometimes [[pyrolysis|pyrolysed]]. The resulting gas mixture, syngas, is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted.

Syngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines, [[turbines]] or high-temperature fuel cells.<ref name="e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch">[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], PhD Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008</ref> The [[wood gas generator]], a wood-fueled gasification reactor, can be connected to an internal combustion engine.

Syngas can be used to produce [[methanol]], [[Dimethyl ether|DME]] and [[hydrogen]], or converted via the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] to produce a diesel substitute, or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline. Gasification normally relies on temperatures greater than 700&nbsp;°C.

Lower-temperature gasification is desirable when co-producing [[biochar]], but results in syngas polluted with [[tar]].

===Ethanol===

{{Main|Ethanol fuel}}
[[File:Sao Paulo ethanol pump 04 2008 74 zoom.jpg|thumb|[[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|Neat ethanol]] on the left&nbsp;(A), [[gasoline]] on the right (G) at a [[filling station]] in [[Brazil]]|alt=]]
Biologically produced [[alcohols]], most commonly [[ethanol]], and less commonly [[Propan-1-ol|propanol]] and [[butanol fuel|butanol]], are produced by the action of [[microorganism]]s and [[enzyme]]s through the fermentation of sugars or starches (easiest), or cellulose (which is more difficult). [[Biobutanol]] (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for [[gasoline]], because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.

[[Ethanol fuel]] is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|in Brazil]]. [[Alcohol fuel]]s are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], [[sugar beet]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[molasses]] and any sugar or starch from which [[alcoholic beverage]]s such as [[whiskey]], can be made (such as [[potato]] and [[fruit]] waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are [[digestive enzyme|enzyme digestion]] (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, [[distillation]] and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable [[natural gas]] fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as [[bagasse]], the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, is the most common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also [[waste heat]] are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory<ref>[http://www.eon.se/om-eon/Om-energi/Produktion-av-el-gas-varme-och-kyla/Kraftvarme/Vara-kraftvarmeverk/Handeloverket/Handeloverket-Panna-15/Energikombinatet_bild/ Energikunskap | Lär dig mer om energi – E.ON]</ref> – where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.

Ethanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline; it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage. Most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bioethanol with petroleum/gasoline. Ethanol has a smaller [[energy density]] than that of gasoline; this means it takes more fuel (volume and mass) to produce the same amount of work. An advantage of ethanol ({{chem|CH|3|CH|2|OH}}) is that it has a higher [[octane rating]] than ethanol-free gasoline available at roadside gas stations, which allows an increase of an engine's [[compression ratio]] for increased [[thermal efficiency]]. In high-altitude (thin air) locations, some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter [[oxidizer]] to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions.

Ethanol is also used to fuel bioethanol [[fireplaces]]. As they do not require a chimney and are "flueless", bioethanol fires<ref>Bio ethanol fires information [http://www.prestigiousfires.co.uk/ bio ethanol fireplace]. (2009)</ref> are extremely useful{{Citation needed|date=October 2020|reason=useful or decorative?}} for newly built homes and apartments without a flue.
The downsides to these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires, and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.

Corn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of [[cellulosic ethanol]]. According to a joint research agenda conducted through the US Department of Energy,<ref>see "Breaking the Biological Barriers to Cellulosic Ethanol"</ref> the fossil energy ratios ([[Fossil Energy Ratio|FER]]) for cellulosic ethanol, corn ethanol, and gasoline are 10.3, 1.36, and 0.81, respectively.<ref>Brinkman, N. et al., "Well-to-Wheels Analysis of Advanced/Vehicle Systems", 2005.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Farrell | first1 = A.E. |display-authors=et al | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol can Contribute to Energy and Environmental Goals | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5760| pages = 506–8 | doi=10.1126/science.1121416 | pmid=16439656| bibcode = 2006Sci...311..506F | s2cid = 16061891 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hammerschlag | first1 = R | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol's Energy Return on Investment: A Survey of the Literature 1999-Present | journal = Environ.

Ethanol has roughly one-third lower energy content per unit of volume compared to gasoline. This is partly counteracted by the better efficiency when using ethanol (in a long-term test of more than 2.1&nbsp;million km, the BEST project found FFV vehicles to be 1–26% more energy efficient than petrol cars, but the volumetric consumption increases by approximately 30%, so more fuel stops are required).

===Other bioalcohols===

[[Methanol]] is currently produced from [[natural gas]], a [[non-renewable]] fossil fuel. In the future it is hoped to be produced from biomass as [[biomethanol]]. This is technically feasible, but the production is currently being postponed for concerns that the economic viability is still pending.<ref>Börjesson.P. et al. 2013, REPORT f3 2013:13, p 170</ref> The [[methanol economy]] is an alternative to the [[hydrogen economy]], to be contrasted with today's [[hydrogen]] production from natural gas.

[[Butanol fuel|Butanol]] ({{chem|C|4|H|9|OH}}) is formed by [[Clostridium acetobutylicum|ABE fermentation]] (acetone, butanol, ethanol) and experimental modifications of the process show potentially high [[net energy gain]]s with butanol as the only liquid product. Butanol will produce more energy than ethanol because of its lower oxygen content<ref name="Schmidt-Rohr 15">Schmidt-Rohr, K. (2015).

{{Further|Biodiesel around the world}}

[[Biodiesel]] is the most common biofuel in Europe. It is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters ([[Fatty acid methyl ester|FAMEs]]). Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, [[soy]], [[rapeseed]], [[Jatropha curcas|jatropha]], [[Madhuca longifolia|mahua]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[flax]], [[sunflower]], [[palm oil]], [[hemp]], [[thlaspi arvense|field pennycress]], ''[[Pongamia pinnata]]'' and [[algae fuel|algae]]. Pure biodiesel (B100, also known as "neat" biodiesel) currently reduces emissions with up to 60% compared to diesel Second generation B100.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.perstorp.com/en/Media/Pressreleases/2013/20130701_Verdis_Polaris_Aura_second_generation_B100/ |title=Perstop Press release: Verdis Polaris Aura – second generation B100 – The advanced green one |access-date=21 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804182248/https://www.perstorp.com/en/Media/Pressreleases/2013/20130701_Verdis_Polaris_Aura_second_generation_B100/ |archive-date=4 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> {{as of|2020}}, researchers at Australia's [[CSIRO]] have been studying [[safflower]] oil as an engine [[lubricant]], and researchers at [[Montana State University]]'s Advanced Fuel Centre in the US have been studying the oil's performance in a large [[diesel engine]], with results described as a "game-changer".<ref>{{cite web | title=Safflower oil hailed by scientists as possible recyclable, biodegradable replacement for petroleum  | website=ABC News |series=Landline| publisher= Australian Broadcasting Corporation|first=Tim|last=Lee | date=7 June 2020 | url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-07/safflower-oil-new-biofuel-to-replace-petroleum/12321028 | access-date=7 June 2020}}</ref>

[[File:Targray Biodiesel Railcar.png|thumb|Targray Biofuels Division railcar transporting Biodiesel.]]Biodiesel can be used in any diesel engine when mixed with mineral diesel. It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and performance problems may then occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes somewhat more [[viscosity|viscous]] at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.inforse.org/europe/dieret/altfuels/biodiesel.htm|title=BIODIESEL}}</ref>

In some countries, manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for B100 use, although [[Volkswagen]] of [[Germany]], for example, asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B100<!-- (see [[Biodiesel#Use|biodiesel use]]) -->. In most cases, biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards, which use '[[Viton]]' (by [[DuPont]]) [[synthetic rubber]] in their mechanical [[fuel injection]] systems. Note however, that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before 2014, as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date.

Electronically controlled '[[common rail]]' and '[[Unit Injector]]' type systems from the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the [[fuel rail]] design.
Since biodiesel is an effective [[solvent]] and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, [[oil filter|engine filters]] may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes.

===Straight vegetable oil===

{{Main|Vegetable oil fuel}}
Straight unmodified [[Eating|edible]] vegetable oil is generally not used as fuel, but lower-quality oil has been used for this purpose. Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel, or (more rarely) cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel.

As with 100% biodiesel (B100), to ensure the [[fuel injector]]s atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, [[vegetable oil fuel]] must be heated to reduce its [[viscosity]] to that of diesel, either by electric coils or heat exchangers. This is easier in warm or temperate climates. [[MAN B&W Diesel]], [[Wärtsilä]], and [[Deutz AG]], as well as a number of smaller companies, such as [[Elsbett]], offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil, without the need for after-market modifications.

Vegetable oil can also be used in many older diesel engines that do not use [[common rail]] or [[Unit Injector|unit injection]] electronic diesel injection systems. Due to the design of the combustion chambers in [[indirect injection]] engines, these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil. This system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn. Some older engines, especially Mercedes, are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion. A handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre-"Pumpe Duse" [[VW TDI]] engines and other similar engines with [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]]. Several companies, such as [[Elsbett]] or Wolf, have developed professional conversion kits and successfully installed hundreds of them over the last decades.

Oils and fats can be [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to give a diesel substitute. The resulting product is a straight-chain hydrocarbon with a high [[cetane number]], low in [[aromatics]] and [[sulfur]] and does not contain oxygen. [[Hydrogenated oil]]s can be blended with diesel in all proportions. They have several advantages over biodiesel, including good performance at low temperatures, no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack.<ref name=evans>Evans, G.

Many first generation biofuel projects are not carbon neutral given this definition. Some have even higher emissions than some fossil based alternatives.<ref>«The environmental costs and benefits of bioenergy have been the subject of significant debate, particularly for first‐generation biofuels produced from food (e.g. grain and oil seed). Studies have reported life‐cycle GHG savings ranging from an 86% reduction to a 93% increase in GHG emissions compared with fossil fuels (Searchinger et al., 2008; Davis et al., 2009; Liska et al., 2009; Whitaker et al., 2010). In addition, concerns have been raised that N2O emissions from biofuel feedstock cultivation could have been underestimated (Crutzen et al., 2008; Smith & Searchinger, 2012) and that expansion of feedstock cultivation on agricultural land might displace food production onto land with high carbon stocks or high conservation value (i.e. iLUC) creating a carbon debt which could take decades to repay (Fargione et al., 2008). Other studies have shown that direct nitrogen‐related emissions from annual crop feedstocks can be mitigated through optimized management practices (Davis et al., 2013) or that payback times are less significant than proposed (Mello et al., 2014). However, there are still significant concerns over the impacts of iLUC, despite policy developments aimed at reducing the risk of iLUC occurring (Ahlgren & Di Lucia, 2014; Del Grosso et al., 2014).»

This is controversial, as the allocation of GHG emissions to the management and the use of coproducts can have a large effect on the total carbon footprint of resulting bioenergy products (Whitaker et al., 2010; Davis et al., 2013). The potential consequences of land use change (LUC) to bioenergy on GHG balance through food crop displacement or 'indirect' land use change (iLUC) are also an important consideration (Searchinger et al., 2008).»

GCB Bioenergy, 8: 317–333. https://doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.12263</ref><ref>«While the initial premise regarding bioenergy was that carbon recently captured from the atmosphere into plants would deliver an immediate reduction in GHG emission from fossil fuel use, the reality proved less straightforward. Studies suggested that GHG emission from energy crop production and land-use change might outweigh any CO2 mitigation (Searchinger et al., 2008; Lange, 2011). Nitrous oxide (N2O) production, with its powerful global warming potential (GWP), could be a significant factor in offsetting CO2 gains (Crutzen et al., 2008) as well as possible acidification and eutrophication of the surrounding environment (Kim & Dale, 2005). However, not all biomass feedstocks are equal, and most studies critical of bioenergy production are concerned with biofuels produced from annual food crops at high fertilizer cost, sometimes using land cleared from natural ecosystems or in direct competition with food production (Naik et al., 2010). Dedicated perennial energy crops, produced on existing, lower grade, agricultural land, offer a sustainable alternative with significant savings in greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon sequestration when produced with appropriate management (Crutzen et al., 2008; Hastings et al., 2008, 2012; Cherubini et al., 2009; Don- dini et al., 2009a; Don et al., 2012; Zatta et al., 2014; Rich- ter et al., 2015).»

It is the total amount of absorption and emissions that together determines if the GHG life cycle cost of a biofuel project is positive, neutral or negative. If emissions during production, processing, transport and combustion are higher than what is absorbed, both above and below ground during crop growth, the GHG life cycle cost is positive. Likewise, if total absorption is higher than total emissions, the life cycle cost is negative.

Whitaker et al. argue that a [[Miscanthus giganteus|miscanthus]] crop with a yield of 10 tonnes per hectare per year sequesters so much carbon that the crop more than compensates for both farm operations emissions and transport emissions. (The emissions originating from ''combustion'' are fully absorbed by next seasons' above-ground plant growth.) The top chart on the right displays two CO<sub>2</sub> negative miscanthus production pathways, and two CO<sub>2</sub> positive poplar production pathways, represented in gram CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents per megajoule. The bars are sequential and move up and down as atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is estimated to increase and decrease. The grey/blue bars represent agriculture, processing and transport related emissions, the green bars represents soil carbon change, and the yellow diamonds represent total final emissions.<ref>«A life‐cycle perspective of the relative contributions and variability of soil carbon stock change and nitrogen‐related emissions to the net GHG intensity (g CO2‐eq MJ−1) [gram CO2-equivalents per megajoule] of biofuel production via select production pathways (feedstock/prior land‐use/fertilizer/conversion type). Positive and negative contributions to life‐cycle GHG emissions are plotted sequentially and summed as the net GHG intensity for each biofuel scenario, relative to the GHG intensity of conventional gasoline (brown line) and the 50% and 60% GHG savings thresholds (US Renewable Fuel Standard and Council Directive 2015/1513); orange and red lines, respectively.

Successful sequestration is dependent on planting sites, as the best soils for sequestration are those that are currently low in carbon. The varied results displayed in the graph highlights this fact.<ref>«Whilst these values represent the extremes, they demonstrate that site selection for bioenergy crop cultivation can make the difference between large GHG savings or losses, shifting life‐cycle GHG [green house gas] emissions above or below mandated thresholds. Reducing uncertainties in ∆C [carbon increase or decrease] following LUC [land use change] is therefore more important than refining N2O [nitrous oxide] emission estimates (Berhongaray et al., 2017). Knowledge on initial soil carbon stocks could improve GHG savings achieved through targeted deployment of perennial bioenergy crops on low carbon soils (see section 2). […] The assumption that annual cropland provides greater potential for soil carbon sequestration than grassland appears to be over‐simplistic, but there is an opportunity to improve predictions of soil carbon sequestration potential using information on the initial soil carbon stock as a stronger predictor of ∆C [change in carbon amount] than prior land use.»

GCB Bioenergy, 10: 150–164. https://doi.org/10.1111/gcbb.12488 </ref> For the UK, successful sequestration is expected for arable land over most of England and Wales, with unsuccessful sequestration expected in parts of Scotland, due to already carbon rich soils (existing woodland) plus lower yields. Soils already rich in carbon includes [[Mire|peatland]] and mature forest. [[Grassland]] can also be carbon rich, however Milner et al. argue that the most successful carbon sequestration in the UK takes place below improved grasslands.<ref>«Fig. 3 confirmed either no change or a gain of SOC [soil organic carbon] (positive) through planting Miscanthus on arable land across England and Wales and only a loss of SOC (negative) in parts of Scotland. The total annual SOC change across GB in the transition from arable to Miscanthus if all nonconstrained land was planted with would be 3.3 Tg C yr−1 [3.3 million tonnes carbon per year]. The mean changes for SOC for the different land uses were all positive when histosols were excluded, with improved grasslands yielding the highest Mg C ha−1 yr−1 [tonnes carbon per hectare per year] at 1.49, followed by arable lands at 1.28 and forest at 1. Separating this SOC change by original land use (Fig. 4) reveals that there are large regions of improved grasslands which, if planted with bioenergy crops, are predicted to result in an increase in SOC. A similar result was found when considering the transition from arable land; however for central eastern England, there was a predicted neutral effect on SOC. Scotland, however, is predicted to have a decrease for all land uses, particularly for woodland due mainly to higher SOC and lower Miscanthus yields and hence less input.»

Smil estimates that the average area-specific power densities for biofuels, wind, hydro and solar power production are 0.30 W/m<sup>2</sup>, 1 W/m<sup>2</sup>, 3 W/m<sup>2</sup> and 5 W/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively (power in the form of heat for biofuels, and electricity for wind, hydro and solar).{{sfn | Smil | 2015 | p=211, box 7.1}} The average human power consumption on ice-free land is 0.125 W/m<sup>2</sup> (heat and electricity combined),{{sfn|Smil|2015|p=170}} although rising to 20 W/m<sup>2</sup> in urban and industrial areas.{{sfn|Smil|2015|p=2095 (kindle location)}} The reason for the low area-specific power density for biofuels is a combination of low yields and only partial utilization of the plant when making liquid fuels (for instance, ethanol is typically made from sugarcane's sugar content or corn's starch content, while biodiesel is often made from rapeseed and soybean's oil content).

Smil estimates the following densities:


'''Ethanol'''

* Winter [[wheat]] (USA) 0.08 W/m<sup>2</sup> {{sfn|Smil|2015|p=228}}
* [[Maize|Corn]] 0.26 W/m<sup>2</sup> (yield 10 t/ha) {{sfn|Smil|2015|p=89}} 
* [[Wheat]] (Germany) 0.30 W/m<sup>2</sup> {{sfn|Smil|2015|p=228}} 
* ''[[Miscanthus giganteus|Miscanthus x giganteus]]'' 0.40 W/m<sup>2</sup> (yield 15 t/ha) {{sfn|Smil|2015|p=91}} 
* [[Sugarcane]] (Brazil) 0.50 W/m<sup>2</sup> (yield 80 t/ha wet) {{sfn|Smil|2015|p=227}}


'''Jet fuel''' 

* [[Soybean oil|Soybean]] 0.06 W/m<sup>2</sup> {{sfn|Smil|2015|p=227}}
* [[Jatropha|Jathropa]] (marginal land) 0.20 W/m<sup>2</sup> {{sfn|Smil|2015|p=227}} 
* [[Palm oil]] 0.65 W/m<sup>2</sup> {{sfn|Smil|2015|p=227}} 


'''Biodiesel'''

* [[Rapeseed]] 0.12 W/m<sup>2</sup> (EU average){{sfn|Smil|2015|p=90}} 
* [[Rapeseed]] (adjusted for energy input, the Netherlands) 0.08 W/m<sup>2</sup> {{sfn|Smil|2015|p=229}}
* [[Sugar beet|Sugar beets]] (adjusted for energy input, Spain) 0.02 W/m<sup>2</sup> {{sfn|Smil|2015|p=229}}



Combusting solid [[biomass]] is more energy efficient than combusting biofuel (liquids), as the whole plant is utilized. For instance, corn plantations producing solid biomass for combustion generate more than double the amount of power per square metre compared to corn plantations producing for ethanol, when the yield is the same: 10 t/ha generates 0.60 W/m<sup>2</sup> and 0.26 W/m<sup>2</sup> respectively.{{sfn|Smil|2015|pp=80, 89}} Oven dry biomass in general have a calorific content of roughly 18 GJ/t,{{sfn|Ghose|2011|p=263}} and every t/ha of dry biomass yield increases a plantation's power production by 0.06 W/m<sup>2</sup>.<ref>Cf. Smil's estimate of 0.60 W/m<sup>2</sup> for the 10 t/ha yield above. The calculation is: Yield (t/ha) multiplied with energy content (GJ/t) divided by seconds in a year (31 556 926) multiplied with the number of square metres in one hectare (10 000).</ref>

As mentioned above, Smil estimates that the world average for wind, hydro and solar power production is 1 W/m<sup>2</sup>, 3 W/m<sup>2</sup> and 5 W/m<sup>2</sup> respectively. In order to match these power densities, plantation yields must reach 17 t/ha, 50 t/ha and 83 t/ha for wind, hydro and solar respectively. This seems achievable for tropical plantations – Smil estimate that large scale plantations with [[eucalyptus]], [[acacia]], [[leucaena]], [[Pine|pinus]] and [[dalbergia]] in tropical and subtropical regions yield 20–25 t/ha, equivalent to 1.20–1.50 W/m<sup>2</sup>.{{sfn|Smil|2015|p=85}} It also seems achievable for elephant grasses, e.g. [[Miscanthus giganteus|miscanthus]] (10–40 t/ha, or 0.6–2.4 W/m<sup>2</sup>), and [[Pennisetum purpureum|napier]] (15–80 t/ha, or 0.9–4.8 W/m<sup>2</sup>), but unlikely for forest and many other types of biomass crops – Smil's estimate for natural temperate mixed forests is 1.5–2 dry tonnes per hectare (2–2,5 m<sup>3</sup>, equivalent to 0.1 W/m<sup>2</sup>), ranging from 0.9 m3 in Greece to 6 m<sup>3</sup> in France).{{sfn|Smil|2008|p=75-76}}
