==Political career==
Støjberg was first elected to office as a member of the city council of [[Viborg Municipality]], a position she occupied from 1994 to 2002. Additionally, she served as chairman of ''Liberalt Oplysnings Forbund (LOF)'' from 1996 to 1999.

In 1999, she first ran for [[Folketing|parliament]]. With the electoral victory of her party in 2001, then headed by [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], she entered parliament.

Since 2005, Støjberg has been a member of the Venstre party management. From 2005 to 2007, she was deputy faction chairwoman in the Folketing. Since 2007, she has represented the electoral district of Western Jutland. From 2007 to 2009, Støjberg was a spokesperson for Venstre.

After the head of government Anders Fogh Rasmussen transferred to a new role in [[NATO]], Støjberg became, in April 2009, Minister of Employment and Minister of Gender Equality, succeeding [[Claus Hjort Frederiksen]]. In 2010, the ministries were restructured and Støjberg was, until the electoral defeat of the conservative camp in 2011, only Minister of Employment. In the opposition, Støjberg became one of the leading public voices of her party and occupied from 2014 to the electoral victory in 2015 the post of spokesperson for Venstre. She has been Minister for Immigration and Integration since June 2015.

==Controversies==
Støjberg led a tightening of Danish asylum law which came into force 1 September 2015, and which, among other things, limited the provision of social services for asylum seekers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Verschärfung des Asylrechts tritt in Kraft|periodical=[[Deutschlandfunk]]|url=http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/daenemark-verschaerfung-des-asylrechts-tritt-in-kraft.795.de.html?dram%3Aarticle_id=329870|accessdate=2015-09-01|last=Albrecht Breitschuh|date=2015-09-01|language=de}}</ref> According to Støjberg, it should be unattractive for asylum seekers to travel into Denmark.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maximal abschreckend|periodical=[[Spiegel Online]]|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/daenemark-migrationsministerin-ist-fuer-maximale-abschreckung-a-1071695.html|accessdate=2016-01-13|last=[[Manfred Ertel]]|date=2016-01-13|language=de}}</ref>

Creating a controversy amongst interest groups advocating for asylum seekers and migrants, ads were posted in [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] newspapers under Støjberg in which people were warned against applying for asylum in Denmark.<ref>{{cite web|title=Abschreckung potenzieller Asylbewerber: Dänemark schaltet Anzeigen im Libanon|periodical=n-tv.de|url=http://www.n-tv.de/ticker/Daenemark-schaltet-Anzeigen-im-Libanon-article15881951.html|accessdate=2016-10-08|language=de}}</ref>

Moreover, particularly in the Anglophone sphere, the "[[Jewellery law]]", which was introduced under Støjberg, and which decreed that asylum seekers would already at the border give up a part of their valuables as a pledge for later service costs was critically reported on,<ref>{{cite web|title=Denmark wants to seize jewelry and cash from refugees|periodical=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/12/17/denmark-wants-to-seize-jewelry-from-refugees/|accessdate=2016-10-08}}</ref> in connection to which comparisons to [[Nazism]] were also made by commentators.{{who|date=November 2017}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Denmark Wants to Take Jewelry From Syrian Refugees|periodical=The Daily Beast|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/16/denmark-wants-to-take-jewelry-from-syrian-refugees.html|accessdate=2016-10-08|last=Barbie Latza Nadeau|date=2015-12-16}}</ref>

In March 2017, Støjberg again attracted international media attention when she celebrated the 50th tightening of immigration law during her tenure as Minister for Immigration with a cake that she photographed and published on Facebook.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/danish-integration-minister-inger-st-jberg-furious-backlash-celebrating-tougher-immigration-laws-a7632161.html|title=Danish minister sparks furious backlash after celebrating tougher immigration laws with cake|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-02-20}}</ref>

Støjberg is currently involved in a controversial application of the Aliens Act being used to criminalize professors who speak or write publicly, which is being classified as a violation of work visas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-06/heartbroken-in-copenhagen-u-s-academic-caught-in-migrant-trap|title=U.S. Tax Expert Caught in Surreal Green Card Trap in Denmark|date=2017-12-06|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-12-06}}</ref>

In May 2018, Støjberg published a post through the Danish tabloid [[BT (tabloid)|BT]], saying that Muslims fasting during Ramadan should take leave from work “to avoid negative consequences for the rest of Danish society.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bt.dk/politik/stoejbergs-ramadan-opfordring-gaar-verden-rundt|title=Støjbergs ramadan-opfordring går verden rundt|work=www.bt.dk|access-date=2018-05-23|language=da}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/world/europe/danish-minister-says-muslims-shouldnt-work-during-ramadan/2018/05/21/ba098070-5d1d-11e8-b656-236c6214ef01_story.html?noredirect=on|title=Danish minister says Muslims fasting for Ramadan pose danger|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=2018-05-23}}</ref> Støjberg cited bus drivers as an example of workers whose performance could be negatively affected by abstaining from food and drink. Her comments provoked a backlash from other Danish politicians. A spokeswoman for the Danish government issued a statement which claimed that Støjberg comments were her own and did not represent the views of the country's government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/46cc830247a54adebe34898444e82334|title=Danish govt: Minister's views on fasting Muslims are her own|work=AP News|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en-US}}</ref> Bus companies also distanced themselves from Støjberg's comments. Arriva, which runs a number of bus routes in Denmark, reported that it had never had any accidents involving drivers who were fasting.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44209471|title=Danish minister prompts Ramadan row|date=2018-05-22|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-GB}}</ref>
