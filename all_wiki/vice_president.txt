A '''vice president''' (in British English: '''vice-president''' for governments and '''director''' for businesses) is an [[Corporate officer|officer]] in [[government]] or [[business]] who is below a [[President (corporate title)|president]] (managing director) in rank. It can also refer to executive vice presidents, signifying that the vice president is on the executive branch of the government, university or company. The name comes from the [[Latin]] ''[[List of Latin phrases (S-Z)#vice|vice]]'' meaning "in place of" and typically serves as ''[[pro tempore]]'' ([[Latin Language|Latin]]: ’for the time being’) to the president.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vice- "vice"], etymologyonlive.com</ref> In some countries, the vice president is called the ''deputy president''. In everyday speech, the abbreviation ''VP'' can be used.

{{see also|List of current vice presidents}}

In [[government]], a vice president is a person whose primary responsibility is to act in place of the [[President (government title)|president]] on the event of the president's death, resignation or incapacity. Vice presidents are either elected jointly with the president as their [[running mate]], or more rarely, appointed independently after the president's election.

Most governments with vice presidents have one person in this role at any time, although in some countries there are two or more vice presidents–an extreme case being Iran's [[Vice President of Iran|12 vice presidents]]. If the president is not present, dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to fulfill their duties, the vice president will generally serve as president. In many [[presidential system]]s, the vice president does not wield much day-to-day political power, but is still considered an important member of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Some vice presidents in the Americas hold the position of [[president of the senate]]; this is the case, for example, in Argentina, the United States, and Uruguay. The vice president sometimes assumes some of the ceremonial duties of the president, such as attending functions and events that the actual president may be too busy to attend; the [[Vice President of the United States]], for example, often attends funerals of world leaders on behalf of the [[President of the United States|president]]. In parliamentary or semi-presidential systems, a vice president may coexist with a prime minister, as is [[Vice President of India|the case in India]] and [[Vice President of Namibia|Namibia]], but the presence of both offices concurrently is rare.

In [[business]], "vice president" refers to hierarchical position that ranges from extremely senior positions directly reporting to C-level executives (in non-financial companies), to junior non-management positions with four to 10 years of experience (in financial companies).

In non-financial businesses, vice presidents often report directly to the [[President (corporate title)|president]] or [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the company and is a member of the executive management team. Some [[corporations]] that use this [[Corporate title|term]] may have individuals with the title of vice president responsible for specific business divisions (e.g., vice president for legal, vice president for sales and marketing, vice president for finance, and vice president for human resources). 

When there are several vice presidents in a company, these individuals are sometimes differentiated with titles denoting higher positions such as executive vice president or senior vice president, with the remaining management team holding the title vice president. The title of assistant vice president or associate vice president is used in large organizations below vice president and there can be a very convoluted list of other types of VPs as seen in the next section. 

As many of these VPs have minimal employees reporting to them, their necessity has been questioned, with for example ''[[Inc Magazine|Inc.]]'' magazine arguing to flatten the corporate hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/the-world-isnt-flat-but-companies-should-be.html|title=3 Reasons to Eliminate Hierarchy in Your Company|date=21 November 2013|website=Inc.com|accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref> Similarly, as universities have adopted a corporate structure<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Slow-Death-of-the/228991|title=The Slow Death of the University|date=6 April 2015|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref> there is concern over administrative bloat<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/research-scores-of-us-top-brass-fail-to-shine|title=Research scores of US top brass fail to shine|date=20 July 2016|website=Timeshighereducation.com |accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref> and over-paying VPs.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Are you overpaying your academic executive team?

''The Fall of the Faculty: The Rise of the All-Administrative University and Why It Matters'' (2011). Oxford University Press.</ref> "Corporate vice president" is an older term that usually denotes a vice president that is named as a corporate officer by the board of directors.  Not all vice presidents in a company in the modern business environment are named as an official corporate officer.{{fact|date=June 2015}}

===Hierarchy of vice presidents===
Depending on the specific organization, the following may be an example of the hierarchy of the vice presidents:

*Senior Executive Vice President (Sr. EVP)
*Executive Vice President (EVP)
*Senior Vice President (SVP)
*First Vice President (FVP)
*Vice President (VP)
*Additional Vice President (Addl. VP) 
*Assistant Vice President (Asst. VP)
*Joint Vice President (Jt. VP) 
*Associate Vice President (Asso. VP)

This comparison is not strictly correct, as ''director'' is a legal term, meaning someone registered with the relevant country's company registrar (or simply named in the legal documents, for countries not having company registration) as having managerial control of the company, and having legal responsibility for its operation, whilst a vice president does not. In either case the responsibilities may be overall to the company, a region (US, EMEA, CEE...), business unit or function such as sales, marketing, IT etc.

===In financial services companies===
In [[brokerage firm]]s, [[Investment banking|investment banks]] and other financial companies, "vice president" is a seniority rank that denotes higher responsibility, though such need not be managerial. The title does not denote an actual managerial position within the company, but often a role relatively junior to the executive board. Financial services companies have multiple vice presidents <ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/16423358 According to The Economist], on the website LinkedIn, the title of vice-president grew 426% faster than website membership growth, from 2005 to 2009</ref>, possibly because the title is a form of [[delayering]] when an employee can not be moved higher in the organization but still deserves recognition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acc.com/legalresources/quickcounsel/lpjtii.cfm|title=The Legal Pitfalls of Job Title Inflation (Part I): Apparent Authority and Employee Misclassification|publisher=Association of Corporate Counsel|year=2013}}</ref>  In most cases, the title merely implies that someone is in a medium-seniority individual contributor role.

==In other organizations==
In other organizations (''e.g.'', [[trade union]]s, societies, clubs) one or multiple vice presidents are elected by the members of the organization. When multiple vice presidents are elected, the positions are usually numbered to prevent confusion as to who may preside or succeed to the office of president upon vacancy of that office (for example: first vice president, second vice president, and so on).<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 457–458|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal|title-link = Robert's Rules of Order}}</ref> In some cases vice presidents are given titles due to their specific responsibilities, for example: vice president of operations, finance, etc.<ref name=":0" /> In some associations the first vice president can be interchangeable with executive vice president and the remaining vice presidents are ranked in order of their seniority.

The primary responsibility of the vice president of a club or organization is to be prepared to assume the powers and duties of the office of the president in the case of a vacancy in that office.<ref name=":0" /> If the office of president becomes vacant, the vice president (or in clubs with multiple vice presidents, the VP that occupies the highest-ranking office), will assume the office of president, with the lower vice presidents to fill in the remaining vice presidencies, leaving the lowest vice presidency to be filled by either election or appointment.<ref name=":0" /> If the bylaws of a club specifically provide of the officer title of [[president-elect]], that officer would assume the powers and duties of the president upon vacancy of that office only if specified in the bylaws.<ref name=":0" />
