'''John Sidney McCain III''' (August 29, 1936&nbsp;– August 25, 2018) was an American politician and [[United States Navy]] officer, who served as a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] for [[Arizona]] from 1987 until his death in 2018. He previously served two terms in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee for [[president of the United States]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]], which he lost to [[Barack Obama]].

McCain graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1958 and [[Early life and military career of John McCain|received a commission]] in the [[United States Navy]]. He became a [[naval aviator]] and flew [[ground-attack aircraft]] from [[aircraft carriers]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], McCain almost died in the [[1967 USS Forrestal fire|1967 USS ''Forrestal'' fire]]. While on a bombing mission during [[Operation Rolling Thunder]] over [[Hanoi]] in October 1967, he was shot down, seriously injured, and captured by the [[North Vietnam]]ese. McCain was a [[prisoner of war]] until 1973. He experienced episodes of [[torture]] and refused an out-of-sequence early [[repatriation|release]]. During the war, McCain sustained wounds that left him with lifelong physical disabilities. He retired from the Navy as a [[Captain (United States O-6)|captain]] in 1981 and moved to Arizona, where he entered politics.

In 1982, McCain was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]], where he served two terms. He entered the U.S. Senate in 1987 and easily won reelection five times. While generally adhering to [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] principles, McCain also had a reputation as a "maverick" for his willingness to break from his party on certain issues. His supportive stances on [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]], [[gun control|gun regulations]], and [[Campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]] were significantly more liberal than those of the party's base. McCain was investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as one of the [[Keating Five]]; he then made regulating the [[campaign finance|financing of political campaigns]] one of his signature concerns, which eventually resulted in passage of the [[McCain–Feingold Act]] in 2002. He was also known for his work in the 1990s to restore [[United States–Vietnam relations|diplomatic relations]] with [[Vietnam]]. McCain chaired the [[Senate Commerce Committee]] from 1997 to 2001 and 2003 to 2005, where he opposed [[pork barrel]] spending. He belonged to the bipartisan "[[Gang of 14]]", which played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations.

McCain entered the race for the [[John McCain 2000 presidential campaign|Republican nomination for president in 2000]] but lost a [[2000 Republican Party presidential primaries|heated primary season contest]] to Governor [[George W. Bush]] of Texas. He secured the [[John McCain 2008 presidential campaign|Republican presidential nomination in 2008]] but lost the [[2008 United States presidential election|general election]] to [[Barack Obama]]. McCain subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the [[Obama administration]], especially with regard to foreign policy matters. In 2015, he became Chairman of the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]]. He refused to support then-Republican presidential nominee [[Donald Trump]] in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]; McCain won re-election to a sixth and final term that same year. McCain was a vocal critic of the Trump administration. While McCain opposed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]], he cast the deciding vote against the ACA-repealing [[American Health Care Act of 2017]].

After being diagnosed with [[brain cancer]] in 2017, McCain reduced his role in the Senate in order to focus on treatment. He died on August 25, 2018, at age 81. Following his death, McCain lay in state in the Arizona State Capitol rotunda and then in the [[United States Capitol rotunda]]. His funeral was televised from the [[Washington National Cathedral]], with former U.S. Presidents [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]] giving eulogies.
