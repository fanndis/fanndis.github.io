===Early years and railroad construction===
Park Avenue was originally known as Fourth Avenue and carried the tracks of the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] starting in the 1830s.<ref>{{cite news|author=Gray, Christopher|title=Before There Was a 'Grand' in Central|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/realestate/before-there-was-a-grand-in-central.html|date=March 3, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 15, 2015|author-link=Christopher Gray}}</ref> The railroad originally ran through an [[Park Avenue Tunnel (roadway)|open cut]] through [[Murray Hill, Manhattan|Murray Hill]], which was covered with grates and grass between 34th and 40th Street in the early 1850s. A section of this "park" was later renamed Park Avenue in 1860, and the name was later applied to the segment between Union Square and [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Gray, Christopher|title=Putting the Park in Park Avenue|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/realestate/putting-the-park-in-park-avenue-streetscapesmidtown.html|date=July 24, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 15, 2015|author-link=Christopher Gray}}</ref>

The Harlem Railroad was later incorporated into the [[New York Central Railroad]], and a terminal for the New York Central at 42nd Street, the [[Grand Central Depot]], opened in 1871.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/grandcentralterm00fitc|title=Grand Central Terminal and Rockefeller Center: A Historic-critical Estimate of Their Significance|last=Fitch|first=James Marston|last2=Waite|first2=Diana S.|date=1974|publisher=The Division|isbn=|location=Albany, New York|pages=|language=en}}</ref>{{rp|3}} But the tracks laid to the new terminal proved problematic.

After the electric trains were buried underground, the area around Park Avenue in the vicinity of Grand Central was developed into several blocks worth of prime real estate called [[Grand Central Terminal#Terminal City|Terminal City]]. Stretching from 42nd to 51st Streets between Madison and Lexington Avenues, it came to include the [[Chrysler Building]] and other prestigious office buildings; luxury apartment houses along Park Avenue; and an array of high-end hotels that included the  [[Marguery Hotel|Marguery]], [[Park Lane Hotel (Manhattan)|Park Lane]], and [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf Astoria]].<ref name="Gray 2010">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/realestate/22scapes.html|title=Covering Its Tracks Paid Off Handsomely|last=Gray|first=Christopher|date=August 19, 2010|website=The New York Times|access-date=December 10, 2018}}</ref> In 1929, New York Central built its headquarters in a 34-story building (now called the [[Helmsley Building]]), straddling Park Avenue north of the terminal.<ref>{{cite web | title=Park Avenue, Interrupted | website=The New York Times | date=December 21, 2014 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/realestate/park-avenue-interrupted.html | access-date=December 8, 2018}}</ref> 

The [[Park Avenue Viaduct]] reroutes Park Avenue around Grand Central Terminal between 40th and 46th Streets, allowing Park Avenue traffic to traverse around the building and over 42nd Street without encumbering nearby streets.<ref name=":15">{{cite news|url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1928/09/02/105202500.pdf|title=New Viaduct Thoroughfare Relieves Park Avenue Traffic Congestion; Result of Many Years' Work.|date=September 2, 1928|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=December 7, 2018|page=Real Estate, Page 123}}</ref> The western (now southbound) leg of the viaduct was completed in 1919,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1919/04/17/archives/link-up-park-av-to-ease-congestion-civic-bodies-celebrate-opening.html|title=Link Up Park Av. to Ease Congestion|date=April 17, 1919|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=December 7, 2018}}</ref> but congestion developed soon after the viaduct's opening, so an eastern leg for northbound traffic was added in 1928.<ref name=":15" />

===Later years===
In 1927, the medians on Park Avenue north of Grand Central were trimmed to add one lane of traffic in each direction. This project eliminated the pedestrian path on the medians, as they became much narrower. The median was extended by one block from [[96th Street (Manhattan)|96th Street]] to 97th Street in 1941, creating the only remaining median on Park Avenue with a pedestrian path and seating.<ref>{{cite news|author=Kadinsky, Sergey|title=Park Avenue's Hidden History|url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2017/10/park-avenues-hidden-history/|date=October 24, 2017|newspaper=Forgotten-NY|accessdate=October 25, 2017}}</ref> In the 1920s the portion of Park Avenue from Grand Central to 96th Street saw extensive apartment building construction. This long stretch of the avenue contains some of the most expensive real estate in the world. Real estate at [[740 Park Avenue]], for example, sells for several thousand dollars per square foot.<ref>{{cite news |title=Peeking Behind the Gilded Walls of 740 Park Ave. |first=Teri Karush |last=Rogers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/09/realestate/09parkave.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 9, 2005 |accessdate=August 15, 2007}}</ref>

In October 1937, a part of the [[Park Avenue Tunnel (roadway)|Murray Hill Tunnel]] was reopened for road traffic. Efforts to promote a Grand Park Avenue Expressway to Grand Concourse in the Bronx were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/park-avenue/ |title=Park Avenue Express Highway (NY 22, unbuilt) |publisher=Nycroads.com |date=February 14, 1935 |accessdate=October 8, 2012}}</ref>

A tradition was introduced in 1945 as a memorial to American soldiers killed in action, whereby [[Christmas tree]]s are placed in the median and lit up on the first Sunday in December at [[Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City)|Brick Presbyterian Church]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/nyregion/05open.html |work=The New York Times |first=Corey |last=Kilgannon |title=Park Ave. Christmas Lights Go Up, and Xiao Ye Closes |date=December 3, 2010}}</ref> On May 5, 1959, the [[New York City Council]] voted 20–1 to change the name of Fourth Avenue between 17th and 32nd Streets to Park Avenue South. The renaming, along with a ban on overhanging signs along the newly renamed Park Avenue South, was intended to improve the character of the avenue.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sign Ban Is Voted on Two Avenues |last=Bennett |first=Charles G. |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0C1EFD345C1A7B93C4A9178ED85F4D8585F9 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 6, 1959 |page=41 |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}</ref> The [[Pan Am Building]] (now MetLife Building), in between the Park Avenue Viaduct's legs north of Grand Central Terminal, was opened in 1963.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Christopher |date=October 7, 2001 |title=Streetscapes/The MetLife Building, Originally the Pan Am Building; Critics Once Called It Ugly; Now They're Not Sure |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/07/realestate/streetscapes-metlife-building-originally-pan-am-building-critics-once-called-it.html?pagewanted=all |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=September 30, 2015}}</ref>

==Route==
[[File:Park Ave E 188th St - Bronx.jpg|thumb|Park Avenue in [[Fordham, Bronx]], near [[Fordham Plaza]].]]

===Manhattan===
{{redirect|Park Avenue South|the street of the same name in Buffalo, New York|South Park Avenue}}
The road that becomes Park Avenue originates at the [[Bowery]]. From [[Cooper Square]] at [[8th Street (Manhattan)|8th Street]] to [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] at [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], it is known as '''Fourth Avenue''', a {{convert|70|foot|m|adj=mid|-wide}} road carrying northbound traffic. At 14th Street, it turns slightly northeast to align with other avenues drawn up in the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]]. From 14th Street to [[17th Street (Manhattan)|17th Street]], it forms the eastern boundary of Union Square and is known as '''Union Square East'''; its southbound lanes merge with [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] south of 15th Street, and the thoroughfare divides into two distinct portions in the one-block section between 14th and 15th Streets.  From 17th Street to [[32nd Street (Manhattan)|32nd Street]], it is known as '''Park Avenue South'''. Above 32nd Street, for the remainder of its distance, it is known as Park Avenue, a 140-foot-wide boulevard.<ref name="gmaps manhattan"/>

Between [[33rd Street (Manhattan)|33rd Street]] and [[40th Street (Manhattan)|40th Street]], the left-hand northbound lane descends into the [[Murray Hill Tunnel]]. Immediately across from 40th Street, the center lanes of Park Avenue rise onto an elevated structure that goes around [[Grand Central Terminal]] and the [[MetLife Building]] (formerly the PanAm Building), carrying each direction of traffic on opposite sides of the buildings. The bridge, one of two structures in Manhattan known as the [[Park Avenue Viaduct]], returns to ground level at 46th Street after going through the [[Helmsley Building]] (also referred to as the New York Central Building or 230 Park Avenue).<ref name="gmaps manhattan"/> The [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] runs under this portion of the street. Once the line reaches [[Grand Central–42nd Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Grand Central–42nd Street]], it shifts east to [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Lexington Avenue]].

[[File:Park Avenue NB past 51st Street Manhattan.jpeg|thumb|right|Park Avenue northbound past 51st Street in Midtown Manhattan]]
As Park Avenue enters [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] north of Grand Central Terminal, it is distinguished by many glass-box skyscrapers that serve as headquarters for corporations and investment banks such as [[Société Générale]], [[JPMorgan Chase]] at [[270 Park Avenue]] and [[277 Park Avenue]], [[UBS]] at [[299 Park Avenue]], [[Citigroup]], [[Colgate-Palmolive]], and [[MetLife]] at the MetLife Building.<ref name="gmaps manhattan"/> Prior to July 2010, the eleven intersections between 46th Street and 56th Street lacked the city's usual pedestrian crossing signals and overhead gantry-mounted traffic lights, because the railroad tunnel ceiling, which is also the street, was not thick enough for their poles' foundations. (These intersections did, however, have upright pole-mounted traffic lights prior to 2010, but there were no [[Pedestrian crossing|pedestrian signal]]s. After 2010, standard gantry-mounted traffic lights and [[pedestrian crossing#Countdown timers|pedestrian "countdown" signal]]s were installed.)<ref>{{cite news |first=William |last=Neuman |title=It's a Deal: Help for Park Ave. Pedestrians |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 22, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/22/nyregion/22walkdontwalk.html |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |first1=Jillian |last1=Goodman |first2=Chris |last2=Rovzar |title=City Finally Installs Crossing Signals on Park Avenue Above Grand Central |newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=July 7, 2010 |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/07/city_finally_installs_crossing.html |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref>

From 47th to 97th Streets, the tracks for [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s [[Park Avenue main line]] run in the Park Avenue Tunnel underneath Park Avenue. At 97th Street, the tracks come above ground, rising onto the other Manhattan structure known as the Park Avenue Viaduct. The first street to pass under the viaduct is 102nd Street; from there to the [[Harlem River]] the railroad viaduct runs down the middle of Park Avenue. Park Avenue in Manhattan ends north of 132nd Street, with connections to the [[Harlem River Drive]].<ref name="gmaps manhattan"/>

The flowers and greenery in the median of Manhattan's Park Avenue are privately maintained, by the Fund for Park Avenue. The [[begonia]] was specifically chosen by the Fund's gardeners because there is no automatic watering system and the floral variety is resilient under hot sun rays.<ref>{{cite news |title=Why Yellow Takes the Wheel |first=Michael |last=Pollak |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/16/nyregion/thecity/16fyi.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 16, 2006 |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}</ref>

===The Bronx===
The avenue is continued on the other side of the river in [[the Bronx]]. In the Bronx, Park Avenue begins at East 135th Street in the [[Mott Haven]] neighborhood. The entire avenue is divided by Metro-North's own right of way in the borough. Between East 135th Street to East 173rd Street, Park Avenue is one way only in either direction in most sections. North of East 173rd Street it is a two way avenue continuing to [[Fordham Plaza]] where it ends.<ref name="gmaps bronx"/>
