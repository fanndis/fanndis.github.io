'''Coca-Cola''', or '''Coke''', is a [[Carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drink]] manufactured by [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. Originally marketed as a [[temperance bar|temperance drink]] and intended as a [[patent medicine]], it was invented in the late 19th century by [[John Stith Pemberton]] and was bought out by businessman [[Asa Griggs Candler]], whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century.<ref name="Eschner2017">{{cite web |last1=Eschner |first1=Kat |title=Coca-Cola's Creator Said the Drink Would Make You Smarter |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/coca-colas-creator-said-drink-would-make-you-smarter-180962665/ |publisher=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |access-date=October 7, 2019 |language=en |date=March 29, 2017 |quote=So Pemberton concocted a recipe using coca leaves, kola nuts and sugar syrup.

The current [[Coca-Cola formula|formula of Coca-Cola]] remains a [[trade secret]]; however, a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.

The Coca-Cola Company produces [[concentrate]], which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. A typical {{convert|12|USfloz|adj=on}} can contains {{convert|38|g}} of sugar (usually in the form of [[high-fructose corn syrup]]). The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and [[vending machine]]s throughout the world. The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for [[soda fountain]]s of major restaurants and [[foodservice]] distributors.

The Coca-Cola Company has on occasion introduced other cola drinks under the Coke name. The most common of these is [[Diet Coke]], along with others including [[Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola]], [[Diet Coke Caffeine-Free]], [[Coca-Cola Zero Sugar]], [[Coca-Cola Cherry]], [[Coca-Cola Vanilla]], and special versions with [[Coca-Cola with Lemon|lemon]], [[Coca-Cola with Lime|lime]], and coffee. Coca-Cola was called '''Coca-Cola Classic''' from July 1985 to 2009, to distinguish it from "[[New Coke]]". Based on [[Interbrand]]'s "best global brand" study of 2015, Coca-Cola was the world's third most valuable brand, after Apple and Google.<ref>{{cite news |title=2015 Ranking |url=http://interbrand.com/best-brands/best-global-brands/2015/ranking/ |access-date=June 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021100708/http://interbrand.com/best-brands/best-global-brands/2015/ranking/ |archive-date=October 21, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2013, Coke products were sold in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers drinking more than 1.8 billion company beverage servings each day.<ref>Elmore, 2013, p. 717</ref> Coca-Cola ranked No. 87 in the 2018 [[Fortune 500|''Fortune'' 500]] list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/|title=Fortune 500 Companies 2018: Who Made the List|website=Fortune|language=en-US|access-date=November 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181110190356/http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/|archive-date=November 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

It is also worth noting that a Spanish drink called "Kola Coca" was presented at a contest in Philadelphia in 1885, a year before the official birth of Coca-Cola. The rights for this Spanish drink were bought by Coca-Cola in 1953.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/10/newser-spanish-town-coca-cola/2638515/|title=Spanish town claims origins of Coca-Cola|access-date=June 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302212931/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/10/newser-spanish-town-coca-cola/2638515/|archive-date=March 2, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1886, when Atlanta and [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]] passed [[prohibition]] legislation, Pemberton responded by developing Coca-Cola, a nonalcoholic version of [[Pemberton's French Wine Coca]].<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Jack |last=Hayes |title=Coca-Cola Television Advertisements: Dr. John S.

By 1888, three versions of Coca-Cola – sold by three separate businesses – were on the market. A co-partnership had been formed on January 14, 1888, between Pemberton and four Atlanta businessmen: J.C. Mayfield, A.O. Murphey, C.O. Mullahy, and E.H. Bloodworth. Not codified by any signed document, a verbal statement given by Asa Candler years later asserted under testimony that he had acquired a stake in Pemberton's company as early as 1887.<ref>{{cite book| last = Pendergrast| first = Mark| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| url = https://archive.org/details/forgodcountrycoc00pend_0| url-access = limited| year=2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = [https://archive.org/details/forgodcountrycoc00pend_0/page/42 42] }}</ref> John Pemberton declared that the ''name'' "Coca-Cola" belonged to his son, Charley, but the other two manufacturers could continue to use the ''formula''.<ref name="Pendergrast1">{{cite book| last = Pendergrast| first = Mark| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| url = https://archive.org/details/forgodcountrycoc00pend_0| url-access = limited| date = 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = [https://archive.org/details/forgodcountrycoc00pend_0/page/45 45]–47 }}</ref>

Charley Pemberton's record of control over the "Coca-Cola" name was the underlying factor that allowed for him to participate as a major shareholder in the March 1888 Coca-Cola Company incorporation filing made in his father's place.<ref>{{cite book| last = Pendergrast| first = Mark| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| url = https://archive.org/details/forgodcountrycoc00pend_0| url-access = limited| date = 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = [https://archive.org/details/forgodcountrycoc00pend_0/page/45 45] }}</ref> Charley's exclusive control over the "Coca-Cola" name became a continual thorn in Asa Candler's side. Candler's oldest son, Charles Howard Candler, authored a book in 1950 published by [[Emory University]]. In this definitive biography about his father, Candler specifically states: " on April 14, 1888, the young druggist Asa Griggs Candler purchased a one-third interest in the formula of an almost completely unknown proprietary elixir known as Coca-Cola."<ref>{{cite book | author = Candler, Charles Howard | title = Asa Griggs Candler | year = 1950 | publisher = Emory University | page = 81 | location = Georgia }}</ref> The deal was actually between John Pemberton's son Charley and Walker, Candler & Co. – with John Pemberton acting as cosigner for his son. For $50 down and $500 in 30 days, Walker, Candler & Co. obtained all of the one-third interest in the Coca-Cola Company that Charley held, all while Charley still held on to the name. After the April 14 deal, on April 17, 1888, one-half of the Walker/Dozier interest shares were acquired by Candler for an additional $750.<ref name=ForGodCountryandCocaColapg44-45>{{cite book| last = Pendergrast| first = Mark| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| url = https://archive.org/details/forgodcountrycoc00pend_0| url-access = limited| date = 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = [https://archive.org/details/forgodcountrycoc00pend_0/page/44 44]–45 }}</ref>

===Company===
In 1892, Candler set out to incorporate a second company; "The Coca-Cola Company" (the current corporation). When Candler had the earliest records of the "Coca-Cola Company" destroyed in 1910, the action was claimed to have been made during a move to new corporation offices around this time.<ref>{{cite book| last = Pendergrast| first = Mark| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| url = https://archive.org/details/forgodcountrycoc00pend_0| url-access = limited| date =2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = [https://archive.org/details/forgodcountrycoc00pend_0/page/49 49] }}</ref>

After Candler had gained a better foothold on Coca-Cola in April 1888, he nevertheless was forced to sell the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names "Yum Yum" and "Koke". This was while Charley Pemberton was selling the elixir, although a cruder mixture, under the name "Coca-Cola", all with his father's blessing. After both names failed to catch on for Candler, by the middle of 1888, the Atlanta pharmacist was quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to Coca-Cola, and hoped he could force his two competitors, Walker and Dozier, completely out of the business, as well.<ref name="ForGodCountryandCocaColapg44-45" />

John Pemberton died suddenly on August 16, 1888. Asa Candler then decided to move swiftly forward to attain full control of the entire Coca-Cola operation.

Charley Pemberton, an alcoholic and opium addict unnerved Asa Candler more than anyone else. Candler is said to have quickly maneuvered to purchase the exclusive rights to the name "Coca-Cola" from Pemberton's son Charley immediately after he learned of Dr. Pemberton's death. One of several stories states that Candler approached Charley's mother at John Pemberton's funeral and offered her $300 in cash for the title to the name. Charley Pemberton was found on June 23, 1894, unconscious, with a stick of opium by his side. Ten days later, Charley died at Atlanta's Grady Hospital at the age of 40.<ref>{{cite book| last = Pendergrast| first = Mark| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| url = https://archive.org/details/forgodcountrycoc00pend_0| url-access = limited| date = 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = [https://archive.org/details/forgodcountrycoc00pend_0/page/48 48]–49}}</ref>

In Charles Howard Candler's 1950 book about his father, he stated: "On August 30 [1888], he [[Asa Candler]] became the sole proprietor of Coca-Cola, a fact which was stated on letterheads, invoice blanks and advertising copy."<ref>{{cite book | author = Candler, Charles Howard | title = Asa Griggs Candler | year = 1950 | publisher = Emory University | page = 81 | location = Georgia}}</ref>

With this action on August 30, 1888, Candler's sole control became technically all true. Candler had negotiated with Margaret Dozier and her brother Woolfolk Walker a full payment amounting to $1,000, which all agreed Candler could pay off with a series of notes over a specified time span. By May 1, 1889, Candler was now claiming full ownership of the Coca-Cola beverage, with a total investment outlay by Candler for the drink enterprise over the years amounting to $2,300.<ref>{{cite book| last = Pendergrast| first = Mark| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| url = https://archive.org/details/forgodcountrycoc00pend_0| url-access = limited| date = 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = [https://archive.org/details/forgodcountrycoc00pend_0/page/46 46] }}</ref>

In 1914, Margaret Dozier, as co-owner of the original Coca-Cola Company in 1888, came forward to claim that her signature on the 1888 Coca-Cola Company bill of sale had been forged. Subsequent analysis of other similar transfer documents had also indicated John Pemberton's signature had most likely been forged as well, which some accounts claim was precipitated by his son Charley.<ref name="Pendergrast1" />

On September 12, 1919, Coca-Cola Co. was purchased by a group of investors for $25 million and [[Delaware General Corporation Law|reincorporated in Delaware]]. The company publicly offered 500,000 shares of the company for $40 a share.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/thisday/gahistory/09/12/coca-cola-sale-completed|title=This Day in Georgia History – Coca-Cola Sale Completed – GeorgiaInfo|work=usg.edu|access-date=June 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115081202/http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/thisday/gahistory/09/12/coca-cola-sale-completed|archive-date=November 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/business-economy/robert-w-woodruff-1889-1985|title=Robert W.

In 1986, The Coca-Cola Company merged with two of their bottling operators (owned by JTL Corporation and BCI Holding Corporation) to form Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.

A few years later two entrepreneurs from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], namely [[Benjamin Thomas (Coca-Cola bottler)|Benjamin F. Thomas]] and [[Joseph B. Whitehead]], proposed the idea of bottling and were so persuasive that Candler signed a contract giving them control of the procedure for only one dollar.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coca-Cola History|website=worldofcoca-cola.com|url=https://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/about-us/coca-cola-history|access-date=June 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407225546/http://www.worldofcoca-cola.com/about-us/coca-cola-history/|archive-date=April 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Candler never collected his dollar, but in 1899, Chattanooga became the site of the first Coca-Cola bottling company.

On April 23, 1985, Coca-Cola, amid much publicity, attempted to change the [[Coca-Cola formula|formula]] of the drink with "New Coke". Follow-up taste tests revealed most consumers preferred the taste of New Coke to both Coke and [[Pepsi]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1913612_1913610_1913608,00.html|title=New Coke – Top 10 Bad Beverage Ideas|date=April 23, 2010|work=Time.com|access-date=June 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191121111728/http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1913612_1913610_1913608,00.html|archive-date=November 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> but Coca-Cola management was unprepared for the public's [[nostalgia]] for the old drink, leading to a [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]]. The company gave in to protests and returned to the old formula under the name '''Coca-Cola Classic''', on July 10, 1985. "New Coke" remained available and was renamed '''Coke II''' in 1992; it was discontinued in 2002.

On July 5, 2005, it was revealed that Coca-Cola would resume operations in Iraq for the first time since the [[Arab League]] boycotted the company in 1968.<ref>{{cite news |author=Rory Carroll in Baghdad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/05/iraq.rorycarroll |title=Cola wars as Coke moves on Baghdad |work=The Guardian |date=July 5, 2005 |access-date=March 13, 2011 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621193954/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/05/iraq.rorycarroll |archive-date=June 21, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In April 2007, in Canada, the name "Coca-Cola Classic" was changed back to "Coca-Cola". The word "Classic" was removed because "New Coke" was no longer in production, eliminating the need to differentiate between the two.<ref>According to a Coca-Cola customer-service representative.</ref> The formula remained unchanged. In January 2009, Coca-Cola stopped printing the word "Classic" on the labels of {{convert|16|USfloz|ml|adj=on}} bottles sold in parts of the southeastern United States.<ref name="wsj">{{cite news |title=Coke to Omit 'Classic' |first=Betsy |last=McKay |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 30, 2009 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123332768434033495 |access-date=June 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200521052905/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123332768434033495 |archive-date=May 21, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The change is part of a larger strategy to rejuvenate the product's image.<ref name=wsj /> The word "Classic" was removed from all Coca-Cola products by 2011.

{{Main|Coca-Cola formula}}

The exact formula of Coca-Cola's natural flavorings (but not its other ingredients, which are listed on the side of the bottle or can) is a [[trade secret]]. The original copy of the formula was held in [[SunTrust Bank]]'s main vault in Atlanta for 86 years. Its predecessor, the Trust Company, was the [[underwriter]] for the Coca-Cola Company's [[initial public offering]] in 1919. On December 8, 2011, the original secret formula was moved from the vault at SunTrust Banks to a new vault containing the formula which will be on display for visitors to its [[World of Coca-Cola]] museum in downtown Atlanta.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2011/1208/Coca-Cola-formula-after-86-years-in-vault-gets-new-home | title=Coca-Cola formula, after 86 years in vault, gets new home | journal=The Christian Science Monitor | date=December 8, 2011 | access-date=June 8, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200124075036/https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/Latest-News-Wires/2011/1208/Coca-Cola-formula-after-86-years-in-vault-gets-new-home | archive-date=January 24, 2020 | url-status=live }}</ref>

====Coca leaf ====
Pemberton called for five [[ounce]]s of coca leaf per gallon of syrup (approximately 37&nbsp;g/L), a significant dose; in 1891, Candler claimed his formula (altered extensively from Pemberton's original) contained only a tenth of this amount. Coca-Cola once contained an estimated nine milligrams of cocaine per glass.

====Kola nuts for caffeine====
Kola nuts act as a flavoring and the original source of caffeine in Coca-Cola. Kola nuts contain about 2.0 to 3.5% caffeine, and has a bitter flavor.

In 1911, the U.S. government sued in ''[[United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola]]'', hoping to force the Coca-Cola Company to remove caffeine from its formula. The court found that the syrup, when diluted as directed, would result in a beverage containing 1.21 [[Grain (unit)|grains]] (or 78.4&nbsp;mg) of caffeine per {{convert|8|USfloz|ml}} serving.<ref>{{caselaw source

 }}</ref> The case was decided in favor of the Coca-Cola Company at the district court, but subsequently in 1912, the U.S. Pure Food and Drug Act was amended, adding caffeine to the list of "habit-forming" and "deleterious" substances which must be listed on a product's label. In 1913 the case was appealed to the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, where the ruling was affirmed, but then appealed again in 1916 to the Supreme Court, where the government effectively won as a new trial was ordered. The company then voluntarily reduced the amount of caffeine in its product, and offered to pay the government's legal costs to settle and avoid further litigation.

Coca-Cola contains 34&nbsp;mg of caffeine per 12 fluid ounces (9.8&nbsp;mg per 100&nbsp;ml).<ref>{{cite book| author = Gene A.

===Franchised production model===
The actual production and distribution of Coca-Cola follows a franchising model. The Coca-Cola Company only produces a syrup concentrate, which it sells to bottlers throughout the world, who hold Coca-Cola franchises for one or more geographical areas. The bottlers produce the final drink by mixing the syrup with filtered water and sweeteners, putting the mixture into cans and bottles, and carbonating it, which the bottlers then sell and distribute to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants, and foodservice distributors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/aboutbottling.html |title=Offices & Bottling Plants |access-date=January 7, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216144908/http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/ourcompany/aboutbottling.html |archive-date=February 16, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Coca-Cola Company owns minority shares in some of its largest franchises, such as [[Coca-Cola Enterprises]], [[Coca-Cola Amatil]], [[Coca-Cola Hellenic]] Bottling Company, and [[Coca-Cola FEMSA]], but fully independent bottlers produce almost half of the volume sold in the world.
Independent bottlers are allowed to sweeten the drink according to local tastes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cokecce.com/pages/allContent.asp?page_id=84#q1 |title=What Is the Difference Between Coca-Cola Enterprises and the Coca-Cola Company |access-date=December 9, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021100615/http://cokecce.com/pages/allContent.asp?page_id=84 |archive-date=October 21, 2012}}</ref>

Coca-Cola has been a point of legal discussion in the Middle East.

Another clause was discussed, whereby the same rules apply if a person is unaware of the condition or ingredients of the item in question.

The Coca-Cola bottle, called the "contour bottle" within the company, was created by bottle designer [[Earl R. Dean]] and Coca-Cola's [[general counsel]], [[Harold Hirsch]]. In 1915, The Coca-Cola Company was represented by their general counsel to launch a competition among its bottle suppliers as well as any competition entrants to create a new bottle for their beverage that would distinguish it from other beverage bottles, "a bottle which a person could recognize even if they felt it in the dark, and so shaped that, even if broken, a person could tell at a glance what it was."<ref name="vigo.lib.in.us">{{cite web|title=Inventory: Earl R.

Chapman J. Root, president of [[the Root Glass Company]] of [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff, including company auditor T. Clyde Edwards, plant superintendent Alexander Samuelsson, and [[Earl R. Dean]], bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room. Root and his subordinates decided to base the bottle's design on one of the soda's two ingredients, the [[coca leaf]] or the [[kola nut]], but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like. Dean and Edwards went to the [[Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library]] and were unable to find any information about coca or kola. Instead, Dean was inspired by a picture of the gourd-shaped [[cocoa pod]] in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show Root. He explained to Root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle. Root gave Dean his approval.<ref name="vigo.lib.in.us" />

Faced with the upcoming scheduled maintenance of the mold-making machinery, over the next 24 hours Dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by Root the next morning. Chapman Root approved the prototype bottle and a [[design patent]] was issued on the bottle in November 1915. The prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base, making it unstable on [[conveyor belt]]s. Dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottle's middle diameter. During the 1916 bottler's convention, Dean's contour bottle was chosen over other entries and was on the market the same year. By 1920, the contour bottle became the standard for The Coca-Cola Company. A revised version was also patented in 1923. Because the Patent Office releases the ''Patent Gazette'' on Tuesday, the bottle was patented on December 25, 1923, and was nicknamed the "Christmas bottle." Today, the contour Coca-Cola bottle is one of the most recognized packages on the planet..."even in the dark!".<ref name="history-of-bottling" />

===Designer bottles===
[[Karl Lagerfeld]] is the latest designer to have created a collection of aluminum bottles for Coca-Cola. Lagerfeld is not the first fashion designer to create a special version of the famous Coca-Cola Contour bottle. A number of other limited edition bottles by fashion designers for Coca-Cola Light soda have been created in the last few years, including [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]].<ref name="Madonna bottle"/>

In 2009, in Italy, Coca-Cola Light had a Tribute to Fashion to celebrate 100 years of the recognizable contour bottle. Well known Italian designers Alberta Ferretti, Blumarine, Etro, Fendi, Marni, Missoni, Moschino, and Versace each designed limited edition bottles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ifitshipitshere.blogspot.com/2010/04/coca-cola-light-get-dressed-by-another.html|title=Coca-Cola Light Gets Dressed By Another Designer, Karl Lagerfeld|access-date=May 14, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721082512/http://ifitshipitshere.blogspot.com/2010/04/coca-cola-light-get-dressed-by-another.html|archive-date=July 21, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Competitors==
[[Pepsi]], the flagship product of [[PepsiCo]], The Coca-Cola Company's main rival in the soft drink industry, is usually second to Coke in sales, and outsells Coca-Cola in some markets.

Coca-Cola's advertising has significantly affected [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], and it is frequently credited with inventing the modern image of [[Santa Claus]] as an old man in a red-and-white suit.

Coke's advertising is pervasive, as one of [[Ernest Woodruff|Woodruff's]] stated goals was to ensure that everyone on Earth drank Coca-Cola as their preferred beverage. This is especially true in southern areas of the United States, such as [[Atlanta]], where Coke was born.

Some Coca-Cola [[Television advertisement|television commercials]] between 1960 through 1986 were written and produced by former Atlanta radio veteran [[Don Naylor]] ([[WGKA|WGST]] 1936–1950, [[WAGA (TV)|WAGA]] 1951–1959) during his career as a producer for the [[McCann Erickson]] [[advertising agency]]. Many of these early television commercials for Coca-Cola featured movie stars, sports heroes, and popular singers.

During the 1980s, [[Pepsi-Cola]] ran a series of television advertisements showing people participating in taste tests demonstrating that, according to the commercials, "fifty percent of the participants who said they preferred Coke ''actually'' chose the Pepsi." Statisticians pointed out the problematic nature of a 50/50 result: most likely, the taste tests showed that in blind tests, most people cannot tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke. Coca-Cola ran ads to combat Pepsi's ads in an incident sometimes referred to as the ''[[cola wars]]''; one of Coke's ads compared the so-called [[Pepsi challenge]] to two [[common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]] deciding which [[tennis ball]] was furrier. Thereafter, Coca-Cola regained its leadership in the market.

[[Selena]] was a spokesperson for Coca-Cola from 1989 until the time of her death. She filmed three commercials for the company. During 1994, to commemorate her five years with the company, Coca-Cola issued special Selena coke bottles.<ref>Orozco, Cynthia E.

The Coca-Cola Company purchased [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1982, and began inserting Coke-product images into many of its films. After a few early successes during Coca-Cola's ownership, Columbia began to underperform, and the studio was sold to [[Sony]] in 1989.

Coca-Cola has gone through a number of different [[advertising slogan]]s in its long history, including "The pause that refreshes", "I had like to buy the world a Coke", and "Coke is it".

In 2006, Coca-Cola introduced [[My Coke Rewards]], a customer loyalty campaign where consumers earn points by entering codes from specially marked packages of Coca-Cola products into a website. These points can be redeemed for various prizes or sweepstakes entries.<ref>[http://www.mycokerewards.com/ My Coke Rewards] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104025504/http://www.mycokerewards.com/ |date=November 4, 2009 }} (Official Site)</ref>

===Sports sponsorship===
Coca-Cola was the first commercial [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]] of the [[Olympic Games]], at the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 games]] in Amsterdam, and has been an Olympics sponsor ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/sponsors/coca-cola|title=Coca-Cola|publisher=Olympic Movement|access-date=August 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821045818/http://www.olympic.org/sponsors/coca-cola|archive-date=August 21, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> This corporate sponsorship included the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] hosted in [[Atlanta]], which allowed Coca-Cola to spotlight its hometown. Most recently, Coca-Cola has released localized commercials for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver; one Canadian commercial referred to Canada's hockey heritage and was modified after Canada won the gold medal game on February 28, 2010 by changing the ending line of the commercial to say "Now they know whose game they're playing".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99msEwWpJBE |title=YouTube Post of Coca-Cola 2010 Olympic Hockey Commercial |access-date=March 2, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629051932/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99msEwWpJBE |archive-date=June 29, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]], Coca-Cola has sponsored the [[FIFA World Cup]], and other competitions organized by FIFA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/marketing/sponsorship/partners/coca-cola.html|title=FIFA Partners - FIFA.com|last=FIFA.com|website=FIFA.com|language=en-GB|access-date=August 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813010802/http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/marketing/sponsorship/partners/coca-cola.html|archive-date=August 13, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> One [[FIFA]] tournament trophy, the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|FIFA World Youth Championship]] from Tunisia in [[1977 FIFA World Youth Championship|1977]] to Malaysia in [[1997 FIFA World Youth Championship|1997]], was called "FIFA&nbsp;– Coca-Cola Cup". In addition, Coca-Cola sponsors [[NASCAR]]'s annual [[Coca-Cola 600]] and [[Coke Zero Sugar 400]] at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in [[Concord, North Carolina]] and [[Daytona International Speedway]] in Daytona, Florida; since 2020, Coca-Cola has served as a premier partner of the [[NASCAR Cup Series]], which includes holding the naming rights to the series' regular season championship trophy.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Brown|first=Maury|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2019/12/05/monster-energy-out-busch-coca-cola-geico-xfinity-become-premier-partners-of-nascar-cup-series/|title=Busch, Coca-Cola, GEICO, Xfinity Become Premier Partners Of NASCAR Cup Series|magazine=[[Forbes]]|date=December 5, 2019|access-date=December 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206004234/https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2019/12/05/monster-energy-out-busch-coca-cola-geico-xfinity-become-premier-partners-of-nascar-cup-series/|archive-date=December 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Coca-Cola has a long history of sports marketing relationships, which over the years have included [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Football League]], the [[National Basketball Association]], and the [[National Hockey League]], as well as with many teams within those leagues. Coca-Cola has had a longtime relationship with the NFL's [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], due in part to the now-famous [[Hey Kid, Catch!|1979 television commercial]] featuring [[Joe Greene (American football)|"Mean Joe" Greene]], leading to the two opening the Coca-Cola Great Hall at [[Heinz Field]] in 2001 and a more recent [[Coca-Cola Zero]] commercial featuring [[Troy Polamalu]].

Coca-Cola is the official soft drink of many [[College football|collegiate football]] teams throughout the nation, partly due to Coca-Cola providing those schools with upgraded athletic facilities in exchange for Coca-Cola's sponsorship. This is especially prevalent at the high school level, which is more dependent on such contracts due to tighter budgets.

Coca-Cola was one of the official sponsors of the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] held on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Coca-Cola is also one of the associate sponsors of [[Delhi Daredevils]] in the [[Indian Premier League]].

In England, Coca-Cola was the main sponsor of [[The Football League]] between 2004 and 2010, a name given to the three professional divisions below the [[Premier League]] in [[association football|soccer]] (football). In 2005, Coca-Cola launched a competition for the 72 clubs of The Football League&nbsp;– it was called "Win a Player". This allowed fans to place one vote per day for their favorite club, with one entry being chosen at random earning £250,000 for the club; this was repeated in 2006. The "Win A Player" competition was very controversial, as at the end of the 2 competitions, [[Leeds United A.F.C.]] had the most votes by more than double, yet they did not win any money to spend on a new player for the club. In 2007, the competition changed to "Buy a Player". This competition allowed fans to buy a bottle of Coca-Cola or Coca-Cola Zero and submit the code on the wrapper on the Coca-Cola website. This code could then earn anything from 50p to £100,000 for a club of their choice. This competition was favored over the old "Win a Player" competition, as it allowed all clubs to win some money. Between 1992 and 1998, Coca-Cola was the title sponsor of the [[Football League Cup]] (Coca-Cola Cup), the secondary cup tournament of England.

Between 1994 and 1997, Coca-Cola was also the title sponsor of the [[Scottish League Cup]], renaming it to the Coca-Cola Cup like its English counterpart. From 1998 to 2001, the company was the title sponsor of the [[Northern Ireland Football League Cup|Irish League Cup]] in [[Northern Ireland]], where it was named the Coca-Cola League Cup.

Coca-Cola is the presenting sponsor of the [[Tour Championship]], the final event of the [[PGA Tour]] held each year at [[East Lake Golf Club]] in [[Atlanta]], GA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pgatour.com/tournaments/tour-championship-by-coca-cola.html|title=TOUR Championship by Coca-Cola|work=PGATour|access-date=June 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803233217/http://www.pgatour.com/tournaments/tour-championship-by-coca-cola.html|archive-date=August 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Coca-Cola has a high degree of identification with the United States, being considered by some an "American Brand" or as an item representing America.

Coca-Cola was introduced to China in 1927, and was very popular until 1949.

A Coca-Cola fountain dispenser (officially a Fluids Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus or FGBA) was developed for use on the [[Space Shuttle]] as a test bed to determine if carbonated beverages can be produced from separately stored carbon dioxide, water, and flavored syrups and determine if the resulting fluids can be made available for consumption without bubble nucleation and resulting foam formation.

Coca-Cola is sometimes used for the [[Coca-Cola treatment of phytobezoars|treatment]] of gastric [[phytobezoar]]s. In about 50% of cases studied, Coca-Cola alone was found to be effective in gastric phytobezoar dissolution.

==Criticism==
{{Main|Criticism of Coca-Cola}}

Criticism of Coca-Cola has arisen from various groups around the world, concerning a variety of issues, including [[health effects]], [[environmental issues]], and [[business practice]]s. The drink's coca flavoring, and the nickname "Coke", remain a common theme of criticism due to the relationship with the illegal drug [[cocaine]]. In 1911, the US government seized 40 barrels and 20 kegs of Coca-Cola syrup in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], alleging the caffeine in its drink was "injurious to health", leading to amended food safety legislation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Benjamin|first1=Ludy T.|last2=Rogers|first2=Anne M.|last3=Rosenbaum|first3=Angela|date=January 1, 1991|title=Coca-Cola, caffeine, and mental deficiency: Harry Hollingworth and the Chattanooga trial of 1911|journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=42–55|doi=10.1002/1520-6696(199101)27:1<42::AID-JHBS2300270105>3.0.CO;2-1|pmid=2010614|issn=1520-6696}}</ref>

Beginning in the 1940s, Pepsi started marketing their drinks to African Americans, a niche market that was largely ignored by white-owned manufacturers in the US, and was able to use its anti-racism stance as a selling point, attacking Coke's reluctance to hire blacks and support by the chairman of The Coca-Cola Company for segregationist [[Governor of Georgia]] [[Herman Talmadge]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/business/06boyd.html?_r=1&ref=obituaries&oref=slogin|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=May 6, 2007|title=Edward F.

Coca-Cola Classic is rich in sugar (or sweetners in some countries) especially [[sucrose]], which causes [[dental caries]] when consumed regularly. Besides this, the high caloric value of the sugars themselves can contribute to [[obesity]].

==Colombian death-squad allegations==
In July 2001, the Coca-Cola company was sued over its alleged use of political [[far-right]] wing [[death squads]] (the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]]) to kidnap, torture, and kill Colombian bottler workers that were linked with trade union activity. Coca-Cola was sued in a US federal court in Miami by the Colombian food and drink union Sinaltrainal. The suit alleged that Coca-Cola was indirectly responsible for having "contracted with or otherwise directed [[paramilitary]] security forces that utilized extreme violence and murdered, tortured, unlawfully detained or otherwise silenced trade union leaders". This sparked campaigns to boycott Coca-Cola in the UK, US, Germany, Italy, and Australia.<ref>{{cite news|title=Coca-Cola Accused|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/29/weekinreview/july-22-28-coca-cola-accused.html|access-date=June 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224203333/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/29/weekinreview/july-22-28-coca-cola-accused.html|archive-date=December 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Guardian">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jul/24/marketingandpr.colombia |title=Coca-Cola boycott launched after killings at Colombian plants |date=July 24, 2003 |newspaper=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian |access-date=February 2, 2016 |last1=Brodzinsky |first1=Sibylla |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131115030/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jul/24/marketingandpr.colombia |archive-date=January 31, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Javier Correa, the president of Sinaltrainal, said the campaign aimed to put pressure on Coca-Cola "to mitigate the pain and suffering" that union members had suffered.<ref name="Guardian"/>
