'''Hanover''' is a [[New England town|town]] located along the [[Connecticut River]] in [[Grafton County, New Hampshire|Grafton County]], [[New Hampshire]], United States. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], its population was 11,260.<ref name="Census 2010">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/0600000US3300933860| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Census Summary File 1 (G001), Hanover town, Grafton County, New Hampshire| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American FactFinder| accessdate=June 22, 2016| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213130204/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/0600000US3300933860| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref> The town is home to [[Dartmouth College]], the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] [[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory]], and [[Hanover High School (New Hampshire)|Hanover High School]]. The [[Appalachian Trail]] crosses the town, connecting with a number of trails and nature preserves.

Most of the population resides in the [[Hanover (CDP), New Hampshire|Hanover census-designated place]] (CDP) — the main village of the town. Located at the junctions of New Hampshire routes [[New Hampshire Route 10|10]], [[New Hampshire Route 10A|10A]], and [[New Hampshire Route 120|120]], the Hanover CDP recorded a population of 8,636 people at the 2010 census.<ref name="Census 2010 CDP">{{cite web|title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Census Summary File 1 (G001), Hanover CDP, New Hampshire|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US3333780|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213043212/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US3333780|archive-date=February 13, 2020|accessdate=June 22, 2016|work=American FactFinder|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref> The town also contains the smaller villages of [[Etna, New Hampshire|Etna]] and Hanover Center.

==History==
Hanover was chartered by Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] on July 4, 1761, and in 1765–1766 its first European inhabitants arrived, the majority from [[Connecticut]]. Although the surface is uneven, the town developed into an agricultural community. Dartmouth College was established in 1769 beside the [[common land|Common]] at a village called "the Plain"—an extensive and level tract of land a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the [[Connecticut River]], and about {{convert|150|ft}} above it.<ref name=Coolidge>{{Cite book | last = Coolidge | first = Austin J.|author2=John B.

At one point in its history, the southwest corner of Hanover was known as "Dresden", which in the 1780s joined other disgruntled New Hampshire towns along the Connecticut River that briefly defected to what was then the independent [[Vermont Republic]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The College on the Hill: A Dartmouth Chronicle |last=Hill |first=Ralph Nading |publisher=Dartmouth Publishing |year=1965 |isbn= |location=Hanover, NH |page=46 |quote= |doi = 10.1349/ddlp.1484}}</ref> After various political posturings, however, the towns returned to New Hampshire at the heated insistence of [[George Washington]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flowofhistory.org/themes/american_republic/western.php |title=The American Republic: 1760–1780: The Western Rebellion |work=New Hampshire Profile |first=Jere |last=Daniell |year=1976 |publisher=The Flow of History |accessdate=2011-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122132910/http://www.flowofhistory.org/themes/american_republic/western.php |archive-date=2010-11-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> One remnant of this era is that the name "Dresden" is still used in the [[Dresden School District]], an [[Hanover High School (New Hampshire)|interstate school district]] serving both Hanover and [[Norwich, Vermont]]—the first and one of the few interstate school districts in the nation.

The film ''[[Winter Carnival (film)|Winter Carnival]]'' (1939) was shot in Hanover.<ref>Barth, Jack (1991).

=== Etymology ===
"Hannover" (as it was spelled in the 1761 charter and in its German original form as well) was named either after a local parish in [[Sprague, Connecticut]], or after the German [[House of Hanover]] in honor of the reigning British-Hanoverian king, [[George III]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hanovernh.org/about |title=About the Town of Hanover |publisher=www.hanovernh.org |accessdate=2011-02-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528152115/http://www.hanovernh.org/about |archivedate=2010-05-28 }}</ref> 
Originally [[Hannover|Han(n)over]] is a city (capital) in [[Lower Saxony]], North [[Germany]]. The name of the German city derives from the [[Low German]] form of what is "hohes Ufer" in German, which translates into "high shore" in English, and describes the high shore of the [[Leine]] river. (see [[:de:Am Hohen Ufer]]; in German).

While it is likely that the name "Dresden" derived from [[Dresden]] in Germany, it has also been suggested that it could derive directly from the old [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] word ''drezg'' ("forest") or ''Drezd'ane'', for an inhabitant of a forest.<ref>The settlers in the riverside forest, an appellation fully compatible with that of the early inhabitants of the Hanover Plain.</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/Library_Bulletin/Nov1997/HoefnagelClose.html| title=Dresden: What Is in the Name| author=Dick Hoefnagel and Virginia L. Close| accessdate=October 25, 2008}}</ref>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|50.3|sqmi|1}}, of which {{convert|49.0|sqmi|1}} is land and {{convert|1.3|sqmi|1}} is water, comprising 2.52% of the town.<ref name="Census 2010"/> The primary settlement in Hanover, where over 75% of the town's population resides, is defined as the Hanover [[census-designated place]] (CDP) and contains the areas around Dartmouth College and the intersections of New Hampshire Routes [[New Hampshire Route 10|10]], [[New Hampshire Route 10A|10A]], and [[New Hampshire Route 120|120]]. The CDP has a total area of {{convert|5.0|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|4.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2}} is water.<ref name="Census 2010 CDP"/>

Hanover borders the towns of [[Lyme, New Hampshire|Lyme]], [[Canaan, New Hampshire|Canaan]], and [[Enfield, New Hampshire]]; [[Norwich, Vermont]]; and the city of [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]]. Inside the limits of Hanover are the small rural villages of [[Etna, New Hampshire|Etna]] and Hanover Center.

The highest point in Hanover is the north peak of [[Moose Mountain (New Hampshire)|Moose Mountain]], at {{convert|2313|ft|m}} above [[sea level]]. Hanover lies fully within the [[Connecticut River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]].<ref name=watershed>{{cite book |title=Water Use in New Hampshire: An Activities Guide for Teachers |url=http://nh.water.usgs.gov/Publications/nh.intro.html |last=Foster |first=Debra H. |author2=Batorfalvy, Tatianna N. |author3= Medalie, Laura  |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Geological Survey |year=1995}}</ref>

There are a number of trails and nature preserves in Hanover, and the majority of these trails are suitable for [[snowshoe]]s and [[cross-country ski]]s. The Velvet Rocks Trail, located on the [[Appalachian Trail by state|Appalachian Trail]], has a number of [[rock climbing]] and [[bouldering]] spots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainproject.com/area/107529408/black-velvet-canyon-boulders|title=Climbing in Black Velvet Canyon Boulders, Red Rock|website=Mountain Project|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref>

In the [[New Hampshire Senate]], Hanover is included in the 5th District and is represented by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Martha S. Hennessey. On the New Hampshire Executive Council, Hanover is in the 1st District and is represented by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Michael J. Cryans]]. In the United States House of Representatives, Hanover is a part of [[New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district]] and is currently represented by Democrat [[Ann McLane Kuster]].

Like most other college towns, Hanover is a liberal bastion and a Democratic stronghold in presidential elections. No Republican presidential nominee has managed to receive over 32 percent of the vote in the town in the past two decades. Hanover backed [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] with 85 percent of the vote in 2016, providing the former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and [[U.S. Senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] with her largest margin of victory in the state of New Hampshire, which she narrowly won by 2,736 votes statewide. Her margin of victory in Hanover was by over twice that amount, allowing attribution that her margin in Hanover was what ultimately allowed her to carry the Granite State. However, Hanover did not back Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary (supporting [[Barack Obama]] with 58.15 percent of the vote to Clinton's 26.11 percent) nor did it support her in the 2016 Democratic primary when voters opted for [[U.S. Senator]] [[Bernie Sanders]] from neighboring [[Vermont]] with 53.04 percent of the vote.
