In the [[French Civil Service]], an inspector general (''inspecteur général'') is a member of a body of civil servants known as ''inspection générale'', generally of a high level, charged with a nationwide mission to inspect some specific services and provide government officials with advice regarding that service. For example:
* ''[[General Inspection of Finances (France)|Inspection Générale des Finances]]'' (IGF; Ministry of Finances)
* ''[[IGAS|Inspection Générale des Affaires Sociales]]'' (IGAS; Social Security)
* ''{{ill|Inspection générale de l'administration|fr}}'' (IGA; various administrative departments, e.g. [[Prefectures in France|prefectures]])
* ''Inspection générale de l'Éducation Nationale'' (Ministry of National Education: teaching issues)
* ''Inspection générale de l'administration de l'Éducation Nationale'' (ministries of National Education and Research: administrative issues)
* [[French National Police]] [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]]
** ''Inspection générale de la Police Nationale'' (except [[Paris]] and close suburbs)
** ''Inspection générale des services'' of the [[Prefecture of Police]] (Paris and surroundings).

The ''inspection générale des Finances'' is particularly prestigious as a job appointment after studies at the ''[[École Nationale d'Administration]]''. In recent decades, many of its members have occupied various high positions in lieu of their traditional mission of inspection. The corps has come under increased criticism for this.

==Germany==

Since the reestablishment of the German armed forces after World War II, the [[Inspector General of the Bundeswehr|inspector general of the federal armed forces]] (''Generalinspekteur der Bundeswehr'') is the highest-ranking soldier, responsible for the overall military planning and the principal military advisor to the federal minister of defense and the federal government. Head of the Command Staff of the Armed Forces (''Führungsstab der Streitkräfte''), his position is broadly equivalent to that of the American [[chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In the German federal police (''Bundespolizei''), the highest-ranking police officer is called inspector of the federal police as well, although this position is a more coordinating than commanding one. For all state alert police services there also exists an inspector (''Inspekteur der Bereitschaftspolizeien der Länder''). All of the sixteen German state police departements has an inspector, as the highest-ranking police officer. The state police presidents are normally not police officers, they are administration officials. The competence for police services in Germany is assigned to the federal states of Germany. The federal police is a coordinating police département with only a few competences, e.g. in border control or airport and trial security.

In the scope of responsibility of the state police departments the federal police can only act with permission or request of the local state police.
