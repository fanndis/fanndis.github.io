{{United Kingdom in the European Union}}

The '''European Parliament election, 2004''' was the [[United Kingdom]]'s part of the wider [[2004 European Parliament election]] which was held between 10 and 13 June 2004 in the 25 member states of the [[European Union]]. The United Kingdom's part of this election was held on Thursday 10 June 2004. The election also coincided with the [[2004 United Kingdom local elections|2004 local elections]] and the [[2004 London Assembly election|London Assembly]] and [[2004 London mayoral election|mayoral]] elections. In total, 78 [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] were elected from the United Kingdom using [[proportional representation]].

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] both polled poorly. The Conservatives experienced their second-lowest ever recorded vote share in a national election (even less than their 1832 nadir, although the party would do worse still in the [[2014 European Parliament election|2014]] and [[2019 European Parliament election|2019]] elections), and Labour their lowest since 1918. The [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) saw a large increase in support, increasing its number of [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s from 3 to 12 and on popular vote pushed the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], who themselves had increased their representation from 10 to 12 seats into fourth place. In [[Northern Ireland]], [[Sinn Féin]] beat the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]] in the polls and took its first Northern Ireland seat.

==Background==

===Electoral system===
The United Kingdom elected 78 [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] using [[proportional representation]]. The United Kingdom was divided into twelve multi-member constituencies. The eleven of these regions which form [[Great Britain]] used a closed-list [[Party-list proportional representation|party list system]] method of [[proportional representation]], calculated using the [[D'Hondt method]]. [[Northern Ireland]] used the [[Single transferable vote|Single Transferable Vote]] (STV). As a consequence of the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union]], the number of [[Apportionment in the European Parliament|seats allocated]] to the United Kingdom was fewer than in 1999.

It was the first European election to be held in the United Kingdom using postal-only voting in four areas: the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, and East Midlands
regions.<ref>{{Citation|title=Research Paper 04/50 European Parliament elections 2004|publisher=House of Commons Library|date=23 June 2004}}</ref>

===Regional seat allocations===
A combination of the effects of the [[Treaty of Nice]] and the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union]] meant that the number of [[Apportionment in the European Parliament|seats allocated]] to the United Kingdom for the 2004 election was reduced from the 87 MEPs allocated for the [[1999 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|1999]] election to 78 MEPs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/institutional_affairs/treaties/nice_treaty/nice_treaty_bodies_en.htm|title=Treaty of Nice: The other institutions and bodies of the Union|publisher=Europa|accessdate=25 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=245975&p_p_state=normal&originalUrl=%2Fobj%2Fchanges_in_the_distribution_of_seats_in_the_european_parliament-en-e6d28948-3fa8-4fe7-a552-1b062bc6fb47.html&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_id=viewer_display2_WAR_ena2010viewerportlet&_viewer_display2_WAR_ena2010viewerportlet_objectId=e6d28948-3fa8-4fe7-a552-1b062bc6fb47&_viewer_display2_WAR_ena2010viewerportlet_contentLocale=en&languageId=en&_viewer_display2_WAR_ena2010viewerportlet_parentObjectId=null&p_p_mode=view|title=Changes in the distribution of seats in the European Parliament|publisher=Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe|accessdate=25 May 2014}}</ref>

==Results==

[[File:European Parliament election, 2004 (United Kingdom).svg|thumb|Partial map, showing most popular party by counting area on Great Britain only.]]
Turnout for all the regions was 37.6% on an electorate of 45,309,760{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] both polled poorly. The Conservatives, although getting a vote share 4.1% greater than Labour, experienced their lowest vote share in a national election since 1832. Labour's vote share was its lowest since 1918. Labour's decline in votes was regarded as being largely due to widespread public dissatisfaction about the Iraq War and, as with the Conservatives, the increased popularity of [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]]. UKIP saw a large increase in support, increasing its number of [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s from 3 to 12, drawing level with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], who themselves had increased their representation from 10 to 12 seats. UKIP polled higher than the Liberal Democrats and pushing them into fourth place.

Turnout was lowest in Scotland, which did not hold local elections on the same day. In Scotland, Labour topped the poll, followed by the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP). The Conservative Party's share of the vote declined by 2 percent, making it the region with the smallest swing against them.<ref name= "Research Paper 04/50 European Parliament elections 2004"/>

Wales was the only region were Labour increased its share of the vote compared to 1999. The Conservatives managed to make gains pushing Plaid Cymru into third and whose share of the vote fell by 12 percentage points relative to 1999. Similarly UKIP narrowly beat the Liberal Democrats into fourth place. Wales was the region were the Green Party polled their lowest share of the vote.<ref name= "Research Paper 04/50 European Parliament elections 2004"/>

†Loss/gain figures for seats are losses/gains versus the 1999 notional result, as the number of MEPs overall fell.

===Gibraltar===
{{Main|European Parliament election, 2004 (Gibraltar)}}
Gibraltar participated in the United Kingdom's election for the first time in 2004 as part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England constituency]]. Gibraltar is a [[British Overseas Territories|British overseas territory]] (BOT) and therefore is under the [[jurisdiction]] and [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|sovereignty]] of the [[United Kingdom]] but does not form part of it.<ref name=fco>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-us/what-we-do/overseas-territories The 14 Territories]</ref> Gibraltar is however part of the EU, the only BOT to be so. Following however, the result of the successful challenge of ''[[Matthews v United Kingdom]]'' before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 1999<ref name="webcitation.org"/> residents of [[Gibraltar]] were given the right to vote in the European Parliament elections. The British government decided not to give Gibraltar its own seat due to its small electorate of just over 20,000 which would have meant with just one seat Gibraltar would have been over-represented by about 30 times the average.<ref name="Court upholds Rock voting rights"/>

None of the main [[List of political parties in Gibraltar|Gibraltar political parties]] contested the election, so voters chose from United Kingdom party lists. However, Lyana Armstrong-Emery of Gibraltar's [[Reform Party (Gibraltar)|Reform Party]] had a place on a joint list with the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]]. In addition both the leader of the Conservative Party, [[Michael Howard]], and his deputy, [[Michael Ancram]], campaigned in Gibraltar.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/1462148/The-Tories-won%27t-let-you-down,-Howard-tells-Gibraltar.html|title=The Tories won't let you down, Howard tells Gibraltar|accessdate=19 September 2008|last=Wilkinson|first=Isambard|date=18 May 2004|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>
