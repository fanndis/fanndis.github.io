"'''I Knew You Were Trouble'''" (stylized as "'''I Knew You Were Trouble.'''") is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] for her fourth studio album, ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012). It was released on October 9, 2012, by [[Big Machine Records]], as the third [[Promotional recording#Countdown to album release programs|promotional single]] from the album. It was later promoted as the third single from the album on November 27, 2012. As the fourth track on ''Red'', the song was written by Swift, [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], with the production handled by the latter two. "I Knew You Were Trouble" has been described as a "kiss-off" and "[[Breakup song|breakup banger]]" with an uptempo [[pop rock]], [[electropop]], and [[dance-pop]] sound, with strong influences of [[dubstep]]. Its lyrics detail a toxic relationship.

"I Knew You Were Trouble" received positive reviews from [[music critics]], who commended its mainstream appeal yet noted Swift's experimentation with dubstep as relatively limited. Upon release as a promotional single, due to strong [[Music download|digital sales]], the song sold more than 416,000&nbsp;copies in its first week, and debuted at number-three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, becoming the third consecutive top-ten single from ''Red''. Swift became the first artist in digital history to have two songs sell more than 400,000 copies in their first-weeks, the other being the lead single of ''Red'', "[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]". In January 2013, "I Knew You Were Trouble" reached a new peak of number-two on the Hot 100, selling a further 582,000 copies in a week. The song also topped the [[Digital Songs|''Billboard'' Digital Songs]], [[Pop Songs]] and [[Adult Pop Songs]] charts.

At the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]], "I Knew You Were Trouble" was nominated for [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] and won the [[Best Female Video]]—her second win in the category following "[[You Belong with Me]]" (2009). It also won the Song of the Year at the [[2013 Radio Disney Music Awards]] and the [[YouTube]] phenomenon award at the inaugural [[YouTube Music Awards]] in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1163514/youtube-music-awards-eminem-among-winners |title=YouTube Music Awards: Eminem Among Winners |publisher=BSkyB |date=2013-11-05 |accessdate=2014-04-07}}</ref> As of July 2019, the song had sold 5.42&nbsp;million pure copies in the United States. It has been certified [[RIAA certification|7× Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), for moving over 7 million units in the country. It is also received 6× Platinum and 5× Platinum certifications in Australia and Canada, respectively.

During her performance at the [[IHeartRadio music festival|2012 iHeart Radio Music Festival]] in [[Las Vegas]], Swift told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine that she would start unveiling the songs from her fourth studio album, ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'', one-by-one. "Starting this week I’m gonna start unveiling new music... I really want there to be so many surprises left on the record for when it comes out eventually, some collaborations that haven't been talked about and some songs that are definitely what make the album so unique," she added.<ref name="rs">{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swift-hints-at-surprise-collaborations-for-red-20120923|title=Taylor Swift Hints at Surprise Collaborations for 'Red'|last=Baltin|first=Steve|date=September 23, 2012|accessdate=December 10, 2012|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Jann S.

What's the lighting gonna be like? What costumes are we gonna have?"—and one of the songs that stood out to her for its visual aspect was called "I Knew You Were Trouble.".<ref name="rs"/>

<blockquote>
"I had just gone through an experience that made me write this song about like knowing the second you see someone like, 'Oh, this is going to be interesting. It's going to be dangerous, but look at me going in there anyway... I think that for me, it was the first time I ever kind of noticed that in myself, like when you are curious about something you know might be bad for you, but you know that you are going to go for it anyway because if you don't, you'll have greater regrets about not seeing where that would go, but I think that for me it all went along with this record that was pushing boundaries, like the sound of this record pushes boundaries, it was writing about something I hadn't written before."<ref name="toxic"/>

The [[melody]] of the song was developed by Swift on a [[piano]] and she asked Martin and Shellback to make the final sound "as chaotic as that emotion felt".<ref name="time">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/10/19/taylor-swift-on-going-pop-ignoring-the-gossip-and-the-best-worst-nickname-shes-ever-had/|title=Taylor Swift on Going Pop, Ignoring the Gossip and the Best (Worst) Nickname She's Ever Had|last=Macsai|first=Dan|date=October 19, 2012|accessdate=December 10, 2012|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref> She also wanted to sing the [[bassline]] of the song in a particular way and sound, to which Martin and Shellback suggested to infuse a little bit of [[dubstep]].<ref name="time"/> Unaware of the fact that the sound she had asked for in "I Knew You Were Trouble" was actually dubstep, Swift recalled having listened to dubstep music presented to her by British musician [[Ed Sheeran]], who played her the songs popular in the UK clubs.

==Critical reception==
The song received generally positive reviews from critics, who complimented its mainstream appeal though many noted Swift's experimentation with [[dubstep]] was relatively limited. ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic Jon Caramanica praised the song, calling it "one of [2012's] great pop songs" and noting that the dubstep element "arrives halfway through like a wrecking ball, changing the course not just of the song but also of Ms. Swift's career."<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|last=Caramanica|first=Jon|title=No More Kid Stuff for Taylor Swift|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/arts/music/no-more-kid-stuff-for-taylor-swift.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 24, 2012|accessdate=November 5, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''{{'}}s Mark Hogan compared the song positively to lead single "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", calling it "peppy, uber-catchy pop" and "a far cry from traditional country". The reviewer also commented that "yes, 'Trouble' shows some wub...

[[Hearst Corporation|Hearts Magazines UK]]|last=Corner|first=Lewis}}</ref> Randall Roberts from ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote in-depth about the repercussions of Swift using dubstep in her songs, and her departure from country music with the songs from ''Red'':
<blockquote>
It's unfair to criticize a 22-year-old for adapting with the times, though, especially considering the sound in question is merely one part of a precision-built machine that is 'I Knew You Were Trouble'. After all, Swift is the pop moment, and the ways in which she and her peers adapt new sounds and vibes into their work is the lifeblood of pop innovation. Even if the bass drop in question is a conceit – it's not like the song is going to be a hit among dudes rocking to [[Rusko (musician)|Rusko]] – the Max Martin/Shellback collaboration is made better by the bass (as is usually the case).

It's for that reason that Swift's use of it has prompted so much discussion. Pop has been sonically conservative for the past half-decade (at least). Any hint at evolution or surprise from the upper echelons of the charts is a welcome development. And even if said surprise is little and relatively inconsequential, it serves as a reminder of pop's fluidity.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/oct/09/entertainment/la-et-ms-first-take-taylor-swift-accents-new-single-with-hint-of-dubstep-20121009|title=First take: Taylor Swift accents new single with hint of dubstep|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=October 9, 2012|accessdate=December 11, 2012|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

There might be a little part of us that misses Swift's very personal and idiosyncratic songcraft, but it's already clear that it's elsewhere on the album – and the introduction of these all-star producers into the mix is giving Swift a chance to show that she's way more versatile than just a girl with a guitar."<ref name="idol">{{cite web|title=Taylor Swift's "I Knew You Were Trouble": Listen to the Dubstep Track|url=http://idolator.com/7077381/taylor-swifts-i-knew-you-were-trouble-listen-to-the-dubstep-track|publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]].

===Synopsis===

The video starts with Swift speaking in a confessional voice-over. Swift wakes up on an abandoned desert, surrounded by trash and debris, and wearing dark makeup. Flashbacks show Swift and her boyfriend engaging in various stunts, along with a few tender moments, such as when Swift's boyfriend gives her a necklace as a gift. After a while of what seems to be a good relationship, she begins to realize something is wrong. While in his parked car, he leans over to kiss her when some police pull up for him. He starts a fight in a club, which results in the both of them being injured. There are also scenes of her in a grimy small bathroom, looking at herself in the mirror. While at an outdoor concert, she sees him kissing a large number of different girls. He then looks at her in a nonchalant fashion. She falls asleep in the desert where the party is being held, and wakes up alone the next morning. The video ends with her letting go of the necklace he gave her.
