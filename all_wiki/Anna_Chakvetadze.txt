====2013: Retirement====

==Playing style==
Chakvetadze was a baseline player, whose game depended upon her excellent defensive skills. Her greatest assets were her speed, court coverage, shot selection, anticipation, and footwork. Her forehand and backhand were both hit flat and with depth, although she could hit her backhand with slice as and when the situation required. She was an excellent counterpuncher, with her exemplary fitness allowing her to extend rallies until she could create an opportunity to hit a winner. Her best groundstroke shots were her forehand and backhand, both down the line. Her first serve averaged 96 mph (155 km/h), and peaked at 109 mph (175 km/h), allowing her to serve aces and dictate service points. Her second serve was reliable, averaging 81 mph (130 km/h), meaning that double faults were uncommon; she was also excellent at defending her second serve with her powerful groundstrokes. Due to her doubles experience, she was a capable volleyer, and was adept at the net, but chose to play mostly from the baseline. Chakvetadze's major weaknesses were her lack of confidence and nerves. In difficult moments, she would commit many uncharacteristic unforced errors. Due to the careful nature of her game and her excellent point construction and shot selection, she was frequently compared to [[Martina Hingis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisconfidential.com/anna-chakvetadze.html|title=Anna Chakvetadze: Meet the new Anna from Russia|work=Tennis Confidential|accessdate=18 July 2020}}</ref>
