It convenes in [[Hanover]] and currently consists of 137 members consisting of five parties. Since 2017 the majority has been a coalition of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]], supporting the cabinet of [[Minister-President]] [[Stephan Weil]] (SPD).<ref>[http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_171/nn_11596/sid_BFFAC37F60144DE89641ED5F567AC23F/nsc_true/EN/organisation-en/laender-en/ni-en/ni-en-node.html?__nnn=true Bundesrat.

==Landtag building==
[[File:13-03-19-landtag-niedersachsen-by-RalfR-179.jpg|thumb|left|Leineschloss]]
The Landtag is situated in the [[Leineschloss]], a former residence of the kings of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]]. After its destruction in [[World War II]] it was rebuilt from 1957 to 1962. Thus, from 1947 to 1962, the parliament of Lower Saxony convened in the Old town hall (''Stadthalle Hanover'').

==Current composition==
After the [[2013 Lower Saxony state election|elections of January 20, 2013]], the composition of the Lower Saxony Landtag is as follows:
{| class="wikitable"  
!Party
!Seats
!(Percent)
|-
|[[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union (CDU)]] || 54 || 36.0%
|-
|[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party (SPD)]] || 49 || 32.6%
|-
|[[Alliance '90/The Greens|Alliance '90/The Greens (Die Grünen)]] || 20 || 13.7%
|-
|[[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party (FDP)]] || 14 || 9.9%
|}

Elections are conducted using a proportional representation system, with a minimum of 5% vote share to receive any seats in the Landtag.

Currently, the Social Democratic Party and the Greens have a Government even though they do not have a majority of seats. This is due to Elke Twesten switching party allegiance from the Greens to the CDU on August 7, 2017, leaving the government with 68 seats and the opposition with 69 seats. Because of this, Stephan Weil, the SPD prime minister of the state, called for parliament to be dissolved and new elections to be held three months earlier than previously scheduled.<ref>https://www.ft.com/content/6cf9d638-7905-11e7-90c0-90a9d1bc9691</ref>
