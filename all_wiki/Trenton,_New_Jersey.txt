The [[Trenton Six]] were a group of black men arrested for the alleged murder of an elderly white shopkeeper in January 1948 with a soda bottle. They were arrested without warrants, denied lawyers and sentenced to death based on what were described as coerced confessions. With the involvement of the Communist Party and the NAACP, there were several appeals, resulting in a total of four trials. Eventually the accused men (with the exception of one who died in prison) were released.

The Trenton Riots of 1968 were a major civil disturbance that took place during the week following the assassination of civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] on April 4. [[Race riot]]s broke out nationwide following the murder of the civil rights activist. More than 200 Trenton businesses, mostly in Downtown, were ransacked and burned. More than 300 people, most of them young black men, were arrested on charges ranging from assault and arson to looting and violating the mayor's emergency curfew. In addition to 16 injured policemen, 15 firefighters were treated at city hospitals for smoke inhalation, burns, sprains and cuts suffered while fighting raging blazes or for injuries inflicted by rioters. Citizens of Trenton's urban core often pulled false alarms and would then throw bricks at firefighters responding to the alarm boxes. This experience, along with similar experiences in other major cities, effectively ended the use of open-cab fire engines. As an interim measure, the Trenton Fire Department fabricated temporary cab enclosures from steel deck plating until new equipment could be obtained. The losses incurred by downtown businesses were initially estimated by the city to be $7&nbsp;million, but the total of insurance claims and settlements came to $2.5&nbsp;million.<ref>Cumbler, John T.

Trenton's [[Battle Monument, Trenton, New Jersey|Battle Monument]] neighborhood was hardest hit. Since the 1950s, North Trenton had witnessed a steady exodus of middle-class residents, and the riots spelled the end for North Trenton. By the 1970s, the region had become one of the most blighted and crime-ridden in the city.<ref>Listokin, David; and Listokin, Barbara.

Accessed December 1, 2019. "Socioeconomic and housing challenges are especially severe in some of Trenton’s oldest neighborhoods. In the Old Trenton area, abandonment went unchecked for decades, and when abandoned houses were demolished by the city, the empty lots remaining would fill with garbage and vermin. Another hard-hit location was the 'Battle Monument' area: 'Time has not been kind to the Battle Monument section of this city. The five-block area, the hub of the Battle of Trenton in 1775 and of transportation in the 1950s, has in the last four decades suffered from abandonment and neglect.'"</ref>

===Neighborhoods===
The city of Trenton is home to numerous neighborhoods and sub-neighborhoods. The main neighborhoods are taken from the four [[cardinal direction]]s (North, South, East, and West). Trenton was once home to large Italian, Hungarian, and Jewish communities, but, since the 1950s, demographic shifts have changed the city into a relatively segregated urban enclave of middle and lower income African Americans. Italians are scattered throughout the city, but a distinct Italian community is centered in the [[Chambersburg, New Jersey|Chambersburg]] neighborhood, in South Trenton.<ref>Di Ionno, Mark. [http://blog.nj.com/njv_mark_diionno/2007/07/in_trenton_time_marches_on_and.html "Chambersburg"], ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', July 17, 2007. Accessed March 16, 2012. "The difference between Chambersburg, the traditional Italian section of Trenton, and other city neighborhoods that have undergone 'natural progression' is that Chambersburg hung on so long."</ref> This community has been in decline since the 1970s, largely due to economic and social shifts to the suburbs surrounding the city. Today Chambersburg has a large Latino community. Many of the Latino immigrants are from Mexico, Guatemala and Nicaragua. There is also a significant and growing Asian community in the Chambersburg neighborhood primarily made up of Burmese and Bhutanese/Nepali refugees.

The [[North Trenton|North Ward]], once a mecca for the city's middle class, is now one of the most economically distressed, torn apart by race riots following the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] in 1968. Nonetheless, the area still retains many important architectural and historic sites. North Trenton still has a large [[Polish-American]] neighborhood that borders Lawrence Township, many of whom attend [[St. Hedwig's Roman Catholic Church]] on Brunswick Avenue. St. Hedwig's church was built in 1904 by Polish immigrants, many of whose families still attend the church. North Trenton is also home to the historic Shiloh Baptist Church—one of the largest houses of worship in Trenton and the oldest African American church in the city, founded in 1888.<ref>Richard Grubb & Associates. [http://www.trentonhistory.org/THS--Trenton_AA_report-2.pdf ''Three Centuries of African-American History in Trenton: A Preliminary Inventory of Historic Sites''], Trenton Historic Society, September 2011. Accessed December 1, 2019. "Shiloh Baptist Church is the city’s oldest African-American Baptist congregation. The first groups of Black Baptists were formed in the city around 1880, with Shiloh formally organized in 1896."</ref> The church is currently pastored by Rev. Darrell L. Armstrong, who carried the Olympic torch in 2002 for the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Also located just at the southern tip of North Trenton is the city's Battle Monument, also known as "Five Points". It is a {{convert|150|ft|m|abbr=on}} structure that marks the spot where [[George Washington]]'s [[Continental Army]] launched the [[Battle of Trenton]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. It faces downtown Trenton and is a symbol of the city's historic past.<ref name=BattleMonument/>

[[South Trenton|South Ward]] is a diverse neighborhood, home to many Latin American, Italian-American, and African American residents.<ref>[http://www.trentonian.com/article/20091018/NEWS/310189979 "In their own words, South Ward candidates explain why they should win City Council seat"], ''[[The Trentonian]]'', October 18, 2009. Accessed June 12, 2018.</ref>

[[East Trenton|East Ward]] is the smallest neighborhood in Trenton and is home to the [[Trenton Transit Center]] and [[Trenton Central High School]]. The Chambersburg neighborhood is within the East Ward and was once noted in the region as a destination for its many [[Italian cuisine|Italian]] restaurants and pizzerias. With changing demographics, many of these businesses have either closed or relocated to suburban locations.

West Ward is the home of Trenton's more suburban neighborhoods.

[[File:Trenton Makes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Lower Trenton Bridge]] is commonly referred to among locals as the "Trenton Makes Bridge"]]
Trenton was a major manufacturing center in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One relic of that era is the slogan "Trenton Makes, The World Takes", which is displayed on the [[Lower Free Bridge (Trenton)|Lower Free Bridge]] (just north of the [[Trenton–Morrisville Toll Bridge]]).<ref>Bruder, Jessica. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/02/nyregion/jerseyana-trenton-s-fighting-words.html "Jerseyana; Trenton's Fighting Words"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 2, 2004. Accessed March 16, 2012. "''Trenton Makes, the World Takes'', reads the famous red neon sign that spans a bridge between the state Capitol and Morrisville, Pa., affectionately known by locals as the ''Trenton Makes'' bridge.... In its heyday, Trenton was a world-class producer of rubber, steel, wire rope, and pottery. The cables for three famous suspension bridges – the Brooklyn, George Washington and Golden Gate – were produced here at John A. Roebling's factory."</ref> The city adopted the slogan in 1917 to represent Trenton's then-leading role as a major manufacturing center for rubber, wire rope, ceramics and cigars. It was home to American Standards largest fixture factory.<ref>Blackwell, Jon. [http://www.capitalcentury.com/1911.html "1911: 'Trenton Makes' history"], ''[[The Trentonian]]''. Accessed October 28, 2014.</ref>

Along with many other United States cities in the 1970s, Trenton fell on hard times when manufacturing and industrial jobs declined. Concurrently, state government agencies began leasing office space in the surrounding suburbs. State government leaders (particularly governors [[William T. Cahill|William Cahill]] and [[Brendan Byrne]]) attempted to revitalize the downtown area by making it the center of state government. Between 1982 and 1992, more than a dozen office buildings were constructed primarily by the state to house state offices.<ref>Mickle, Paul.

===Television market===
Trenton has long been part of the Philadelphia television market. However, following the [[2000 United States Census]], Trenton was shifted from the Philadelphia metropolitan statistical area to the New York metropolitan statistical area.
