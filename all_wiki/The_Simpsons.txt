The show is set in the fictional town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] and parodies [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] and [[Society of the United States|society]], television, and the [[human condition]].

The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of [[The Simpsons shorts|animated shorts]] with producer [[James L. Brooks]]. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name; he thought Simpson was a funny name in that it had the word "simp" in it, which is short for "[[simpleton]]".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Matt Groening Reveals the Location of the Real Springfield|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/matt-groening-reveals-the-location-of-the-real-springfield-60583379/|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en|access-date=May 1, 2020}}</ref> The shorts became a part of ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour [[prime time]] show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–1990).

Since its debut on December 17, 1989, [[List of The Simpsons episodes|{{Template parameter value|The Simpsons|Infobox television||num_episodes}} episodes]] of ''The Simpsons'' have been broadcast.

A feature-length film, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527&nbsp;million. On October 30, 2007, [[The Simpsons Game|a video game]] was released.

''The Simpsons'' received acclaim throughout its first nine<ref name=Wilson/><ref name=bbcclassic/> or ten<ref name=empirereview/><ref name="LucidWorks"/> seasons, which are generally considered its "golden age". Since then, it has been criticized for a perceived [[The Simpsons#Perceived decline in quality|decline in quality]].

It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 34 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, 34 [[Annie Award]]s, and 2 [[Peabody Award]]s. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase "[[D'oh!]]" has been adopted into the English language, while ''The Simpsons'' has influenced many other later adult-oriented animated sitcoms.<!--The impending Futurama/Family Guy crossovers are mentioned in the 'Influence on TV' section.

==Premise==
===Characters===
{{Main|List of The Simpsons characters}}
''The Simpsons'' is known for its wide ensemble of main and supporting characters ([[ensemble cast]]).

The main characters are the Simpson family, who live in a fictional "[[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]]" town of Springfield.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=28}} [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], the father, works as a safety inspector at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to [[Marge Simpson|Marge Bouvier]], a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], a ten-year-old troublemaker and prankster; [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], a precocious eight-year-old activist; and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]], the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.<ref>{{cite video |people=Oakley, Bill |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Homer's dad [[Grampa Simpson]] lives in the Springfield Retirement Home after Homer forced his dad to sell his house so that his family could buy theirs. Grampa Simpson has had starring roles in several episodes.

The family also owns a dog, [[Santa's Little Helper]], and a cat, [[Simpson family#Snowball V (Snowball II)|Snowball V]], renamed [[Snowball II]] in "[[I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot]]".<ref>{{cite episode |title=I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot |episode-link=I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot |series=The Simpsons |network=Fox |airdate=January 11, 2004}}</ref> Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes.

[[File:Simpsons cast.png|thumb|left|upright=2|''The Simpsons'' sports a vast array of secondary and tertiary characters.]]
The show includes an array of quirky supporting characters, which include Homer's co-workers (also friends) [[Lenny Leonard]] and [[Carl Carlson]], the school principal [[Seymour Skinner]] and teachers [[Edna Krabappel]] and [[Elizabeth Hoover]], neighbor [[Ned Flanders]], friends [[Barney Gumble]], [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], [[Moe Szyslak]], [[Milhouse Van Houten]], and [[Nelson Muntz]], extended relatives [[Patty and Selma Bouvier]], townspeople such as [[Mayor Quimby]], Chief [[Clancy Wiggum]], tycoon [[Charles Montgomery Burns]] and his executive assistant [[Waylon Smithers]], and local celebrities [[Krusty the Clown]] and news reporter [[Kent Brockman]].

The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]''.<ref name="avclub1">{{cite news |url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/ |title=Matt Groening: Interview |access-date=October 22, 2006 |author=Rabin, Nathan |date=April 26, 2006 |newspaper=The A.V. Club |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119014837/http://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/ |archive-date=January 19, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Continuity and the floating timeline===
Despite the depiction of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays passing, the characters do not age between episodes (either physically or in stated age), and generally appear just as they did when the series began. The series uses a [[floating timeline]] in which episodes generally take place in the year the episode is produced even though the characters do not age. Flashbacks and flashforwards do occasionally depict the characters at other points in their lives, with the timeline of these depictions also generally floating relative to the year the episode is produced. For example, in the 1991 episode "[[I Married Marge]]", Bart (who is always 10 years old) appears to be born in 1980 or 1981. But in the 1995 episode "[[And Maggie Makes Three]]", Maggie (who always appears to be around 1 year old) appears to be born in 1993 or 1994. In the 1992 episode "[[Lisa's First Word]]", Lisa (who is always 8) is shown to have been born in 1984.

A canon of the show does exist, although ''[[Treehouse of Horror]]'' episodes and any fictional story told within the series are typically non-canon. However, continuity is inconsistent and limited in ''The Simpsons''. For example, [[Krusty the Clown]] may be able to read in one episode, but not in another – however he is consistently portrayed as being Jewish and that his rabbi father has since died. Lessons learned by the family in one episode may be forgotten in the next. Some examples of limited continuity include Sideshow Bob's appearances where Bart and Lisa flashback at all the crimes he committed in Springfield or when the characters try to remember things that happened in previous episodes.

{{Main|History of The Simpsons|The Simpsons shorts}}
[[File:Jameslbrooks.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[James L. Brooks]] (''pictured'') asked [[Matt Groening]] to create a series of animated shorts for ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''.]]
When producer [[James L. Brooks]] was working on the television variety show ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', he decided to include small animated sketches before and after the commercial breaks. Having seen one of cartoonist [[Matt Groening]]'s ''[[Life in Hell]]'' comic strips, Brooks asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts. Groening initially intended to present an animated version of his ''Life in Hell'' series.<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video |year=2000 |title=The Simpsons: America's First Family |medium=television documentary |publisher=BBC}}</ref> However, Groening later realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require the rescinding of [[publication right]]s for his life's work. He therefore chose another approach while waiting in the lobby of Brooks's office for the pitch meeting, hurriedly formulating his version of a [[dysfunctional family]] that became the Simpsons.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/><ref name=inter>{{cite interview |last=Groening |first=Matt |subject-link=Matt Groening |interviewer=David Bianculli |title=Fresh Air |work=[[NPR]] |publisher=[[WHYY-FM|WHYY]] |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1162008 |location=Philadelphia |date=February 14, 2003 |access-date=August 8, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213045217/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1162008 |archive-date=December 13, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> He named the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart" for his own name, adopting an [[anagram]] of the word ''brat''.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/>

The Simpson family first appeared as [[The Simpsons shorts|shorts]] in ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' on April 19, 1987.{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=14}} Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial shorts.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/> The animation was produced domestically at [[Klasky Csupo]],<ref name="animation">{{cite journal |first=Harvey |last=Deneroff |title=Matt Groening's Baby Turns 10 |journal=Animation |volume=14 |issue=1 |date=January 2000 |pages=10, 12}}</ref>{{sfn|Beck|2005 |p=239}} with [[Wes Archer]], [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], and [[Bill Kopp]] being animators for the first season.<ref name="silverman"/> Colorist Georgie Peluse was the person who decided to make the characters yellow.<ref name="silverman"/>

In 1989, a team of production companies adapted ''The Simpsons'' into a half-hour series for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The team included the Klasky Csupo animation house. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |title=3rd Degree: Harry Shearer |access-date=September 1, 2006 |last=Kuipers |first=Dean |date=April 15, 2004 |publisher=Los Angeles: City Beat |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308105912/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |archive-date=March 8, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called "the mainstream trash" that they were watching.<ref name="toonterrific">{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Tucker |title=Toon Terrific |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=March 12, 1993 |page=48(3)}}</ref> The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989, with "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]".<ref name=officialsite>{{cite web |url=http://www.thesimpsons.com/#/recaps/season-1_episode-1 |title=Simpsons Roasting on and Open Fire |publisher=The Simpsons.com |access-date=September 19, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705153215/http://www.thesimpsons.com/#/recaps/season-1_episode-1 |archive-date=July 5, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> "[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons)|Some Enchanted Evening]]" was the first full-length episode produced, but it did not broadcast until May 1990, as the last episode of the first season, because of animation problems.<ref>{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2001 |title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Some Enchanted Evening" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> In 1992, [[Tracey Ullman]] filed a lawsuit against Fox, claiming that her show was the source of the series' success.

In 1992, the show's production company, Gracie Films, switched domestic production to [[Film Roman]],<ref>{{cite news |author=Bernstein, Sharon |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-21/business/fi-739_1_bart-simpson |title='The Simpsons' Producer Changes Animation Firms |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 21, 1992 |page=18 |access-date=August 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618113432/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-21/business/fi-739_1_bart-simpson |archive-date=June 18, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> who continued to animate the show until 2016. In [[The Simpsons (season 14)|Season 14]], production switched from traditional [[Traditional animation#Traditional ink-and-paint and camera|cel animation]] to [[digital ink and paint]].<ref>{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Al Jean, Jeffrey Lynch, Mike Reiss, David Silverman |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Whacking Day]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The first episode to experiment with [[Digital ink and paint|digital coloring]] was "[[Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode)|Radioactive Man]]" in 1995. Animators used digital ink and paint during production of the [[The Simpsons (season 12)|season 12]] episode "[[Tennis the Menace]]", but Gracie Films delayed the regular use of digital ink and paint until two seasons later. The already completed "Tennis the Menace" was broadcast as made.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.license-europe.com/licensemag/data/articlestandard//licensemag/192007/425752/article.pdf |title=A Salute to the Simpsons |last=Grala |first=Alyson |page=14 |work=License! |access-date=August 11, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925213323/http://www.license-europe.com/licensemag/data/articlestandard//licensemag/192007/425752/article.pdf |archive-date=September 25, 2007 }}</ref>

The production staff at the U.S. animation studio, Film Roman, draws [[storyboard]]s, designs new characters, backgrounds, props and draws character and background layouts, which in turn become [[animatic]]s to be screened for the writers at Gracie Films for any changes to be made before the work is shipped overseas. The overseas studios then draw the [[Inbetweening|inbetweens]], [[Traditional animation|ink and paint]], and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States to be delivered to Fox three to four months later.<ref>{{cite news |title=TV's 'The Simpsons' Goes Global |date=August 5, 2001 |agency=Associated Press |author=Elber, Lynn}}</ref>

==Themes==
{{Main|Media in The Simpsons|Politics in The Simpsons|Religion in The Simpsons}}

''The Simpsons'' uses the standard setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town,{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=28}} serving as a [[satire|satirical]] parody of a [[American middle class|middle class]] [[American way|American lifestyle]].<ref>{{cite news |title=The Simpsons: Culture, Class and Popular TV |author=Flew, Terry |work=Metro |issue=97 |date=March 3, 1994 |url=http://www.metromagazine.com.au/magazine/backisues.asp?keywords=cultu&whichpage=12&pagesize=15 |access-date=June 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722074356/http://www.metromagazine.com.au/magazine/backisues.asp?keywords=cultu&whichpage=12&pagesize=15 |archive-date=July 22, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, because of its animated nature, ''The Simpsons''{{'}} scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the state of the environment.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=55}} Through Bart and Lisa's days at [[Springfield Elementary School]], the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of media channels—from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=388}}

Some commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] bias.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=221–222}} [[Al Jean]] acknowledged in an interview that "We [the show] are of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] bent."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=223}} The writers often evince an appreciation for [[Progressivism|progressive leanings]], but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=224}} The show portrays government and large corporations as evil entities that take advantage of the common worker.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=223}} Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In ''The Simpsons'', politicians are corrupt, ministers such as [[Reverend Lovejoy]] are dismissive to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=56}} Religion also figures as a recurring theme.<ref name="literacy">{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/4555717 |title=Biblical Literacy and the Simpsons|journal=Rethinking Biblical Literacy ed.

==Hallmarks==

===Opening sequence===
{{Main|The Simpsons opening sequence}}
[[File:Thesimpsons.ogg|thumb|right|The music played during the opening sequence. This piece is also known as ''[[The Simpsons Theme]]''.]]
''The Simpsons''{{'}} [[Title sequence|opening sequence]] is one of the show's most memorable hallmarks. The standard opening has gone through three iterations (a replacement of some shots at the start of the second season, and a brand new sequence when the show switched to high-definition in 2009).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4682314/The-Simpsons-opening-sequence-changes.html |title='The Simpsons' opening sequence changes |last=Leonard |first=Tom |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=March 2, 2009 |date=February 17, 2009 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220191329/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4682314/The-Simpsons-opening-sequence-changes.html |archive-date=February 20, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Each has the same basic sequence of events: the camera zooms through [[cumulus cloud]]s, through the show's title towards the town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. The camera then follows the members of the family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The original opening was created by [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], and was the first task he did when production began on the show.<ref name=silverinter>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/interviews/silverman/page4.shtml |title=Top titles |access-date=August 1, 2007 |publisher=BBC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119123229/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/interviews/silverman/page4.shtml |archive-date=November 19, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> The series' distinctive [[The Simpsons Theme|theme song]] was [[composer|composed]] by musician [[Danny Elfman]] in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece. This piece has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.<ref name="elfman">{{cite web|url=http://elfman.filmmusic.com/elfman_la_times.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001024519/http://elfman.filmmusic.com/elfman_la_times.html |archive-date=October 1, 2011 |title=Danny Elfman in the L.A.

One of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard,<ref name=silverinter/> Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone (or occasionally a different instrument), and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch.{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=90–91}}

===Halloween episodes===
{{Main|Treehouse of Horror}}
[[File:Bart Night Gallery.jpg|thumb|Bart Simpson introducing a segment of "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]" in the manner of [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Night Gallery]]'']]
The special [[Halloween]] episode has become an annual tradition. "[[Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode)|Treehouse of Horror]]" first broadcast in 1990 as part of [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]] and established the pattern of three separate, self-contained stories in each Halloween episode.<ref name="BBCI">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season2/page3.shtml |title=The Simpsons Halloween Special |access-date=November 9, 2007 |last1=Martyn |first1=Adrian |last2=Wood |year=2000 |publisher=BBC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103060830/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season2/page3.shtml |archive-date=November 3, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> These pieces usually involve the family in some [[Horror film|horror]], [[science fiction]], or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=31}} They always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Although the ''Treehouse'' series is meant to be seen on Halloween, this changed by the 2000s (and again in 2020), when new installments have premiered after Halloween due to [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]]'s current [[MLB on Fox|contract]] with [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[World Series]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Pick of the Day: The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror XVII |last=Ryan |first=Andrew |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=November 4, 2006 |page=12}}</ref>.  Prior to 2020 (between 2011 and 2019), every ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode had aired in October.

===Humor===
The show's humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show. Such references, for example, come from [[movies]], television, [[music]], literature, [[science]], and history.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=63–65}} The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the show's background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, [[newspapers]], [[billboards]], and elsewhere. The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show or viewing it in slow motion.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=62}} Kristin Thompson argues that ''The Simpsons'' uses a "flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show."{{sfn|King|2002}}

One of Bart's early [[hallmark]]s was his prank calls to [[Moe's Tavern]] owner [[Moe Szyslak]] in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a [[gag name]]. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls were apparently based on a series of prank calls known as the [[Tube Bar prank calls|Tube Bar recordings]], though Groening has denied any causal connection.<ref>[https://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-03/news/vw-42985_1_prank-calls Telephone Trespassing : Think only kids make prank calls? Now grown-ups are dialing, baiting their prey and taping what follows. And thousands collect the recordings.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203211508/http://articles.latimes.com/1993-06-03/news/vw-42985_1_prank-calls |date=December 3, 2013 }} Mark Ehrman.

The New Saigon calls, he says, are his favorites—although he prefers to characterize the similarity between the Moe's Tavern calls and the Tube Bar tapes as 'creative synchronicity.'"</ref>
Moe was based partly on Tube Bar owner [[Louis "Red" Deutsch]], whose often profane responses inspired Moe's violent side.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hudsonreporter.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15354520&BRD=1291&PAG=461&dept_id=523586&rfi=6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218105842/http://www.hudsonreporter.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15354520&BRD=1291&PAG=461&dept_id=523586&rfi=6 |archive-date=December 18, 2007 |title=Joke on 'Simpsons' started in JC |access-date=October 30, 2008 |date=August 10, 2005 |work=[[Hudson Reporter]] |author=Kaulessar, Ricardo |url-status=dead }}</ref> As the series progressed, it became more difficult for the writers to come up with a fake name and to write Moe's angry response, and the pranks were dropped as a regular joke during the fourth season.<ref name="Some">[[James L.

The show uses [[catchphrase]]s, and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=60}} Notable expressions include Homer's annoyed grunt "[[D'oh!]]", Mr. Burns' "Excellent" and [[Nelson Muntz]]'s "''Ha''-ha!" Some of Bart's catchphrases, such as "''[[¡Ay, caramba!]]''", "[[Don't have a cow]], man!" and "Eat my shorts!" appeared on T-shirts in the show's early days.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=25}} However, Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the [[merchandising]]. The use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons. The episode "[[Bart Gets Famous]]" mocks catchphrase-based humor, as Bart achieves fame on the ''Krusty the Clown Show'' solely for saying "I didn't do it."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=61}}

====Foreshadowing of actual events====
''The Simpsons'' has gained notoriety for jokes that eventually became reality. Perhaps the most famous example comes from the episode "[[Bart to the Future]]", which mentions billionaire [[Donald Trump]] having been [[President of the United States]] at one time and leaving the nation broke. The episode first aired in 2000, sixteen years before Trump was elected.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Simpsons predicted a Donald Trump presidency 16 years ago |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-simpsons-predicted-a-donald-trump-presidency-2016-11?r=UK&IR=T |work=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=December 31, 2017 |date=November 9, 2016 |author=Clark, Charles |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101135402/http://www.businessinsider.com/the-simpsons-predicted-a-donald-trump-presidency-2016-11?r=UK&IR=T |archive-date=January 1, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Another episode, "[[When You Dish Upon a Star]]", lampooned [[20th Century Fox]] as a division of [[The Walt Disney Company]].

===Television===
''The Simpsons'' was the first successful animated program in American prime time since ''[[Wait Till Your Father Gets Home]]'' in the 1970s.{{sfn|Alberti|2003 |p=xii}} During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. ''The Simpsons'' changed this perception,<ref name="animation"/> initially leading to a short period where networks attempted to recreate prime-time cartoon success with shows like ''[[Capitol Critters]]'', ''[[Fish Police (TV series)|Fish Police]]'', and ''[[Family Dog (TV series)|Family Dog]]'', which were expensive and unsuccessful.<ref>{{citation|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-28/entertainment/ca-2993_1_prime-time-programs|title='Fish Police' on Endangered Species List|author=Daniel Cerone|date=February 28, 1992|work=[[Los Angeles Times|LA Times]]|access-date=August 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305020006/http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-28/entertainment/ca-2993_1_prime-time-programs|archive-date=March 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> ''The Simpsons''{{'}} use of Korean animation studios for [[inbetweening|tweening]], coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of ''The Simpsons'' and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other adult animated series.<ref name="animation"/> This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows for adults, such as ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'' and ''[[The Critic]]''.<ref name="animation"/> For ''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]], "''The Simpsons'' created an audience for prime-time animation that had not been there for many, many years&nbsp;... As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways—you could classify it as—a wholly new medium."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/08/simpsons200708 |access-date=October 18, 2008 |date=August 2007 |title=Simpson Family Values |first=John |last=Ortved |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827213908/http://www.vanityfair.com./culture/features/2007/08/simpsons200708 |archive-date=August 27, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

''The Simpsons'' has had crossovers with four other shows. In the episode "[[A Star Is Burns]]", Marge invites Jay Sherman, the main character of ''The Critic'', to be a judge for a film festival in Springfield.

===Syndication===
The [[cable television]] network [[FXX]] has [[broadcast syndication|exclusive cable and digital syndication]] rights for ''The Simpsons.'' Original contracts had previously stated that syndication rights for ''The Simpsons'' would not be sold to cable until the series conclusion, at a time when cable syndication deals were highly rare. The series has been syndicated to local broadcast stations in nearly all markets throughout the United States since September 1993.<ref name=Simpsons>[https://www.deadline.com/2013/11/fxx-lands-the-simpsons-in-the-biggest-off-network-deal-in-tv-history/ FXX Lands 'The Simpsons' In Biggest Off-Network Deal In TV History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728172201/http://www.deadline.com/2013/11/fxx-lands-the-simpsons-in-the-biggest-off-network-deal-in-tv-history/ |date=July 28, 2014 }} ''Deadline Hollywood'', November 15, 2013</ref>

FXX premiered ''The Simpsons'' on their network on August 21, 2014 by starting a twelve-day [[Marathon (television)|marathon]] which featured the first 552 episodes (every single episode that had already been released at the time) aired chronologically, including ''The Simpsons Movie'', which FX Networks had already owned the rights to air. It was the longest continuous marathon in the history of television (until [[VH1 Classic]] aired a 433-hour, nineteen-day, marathon of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 2015; celebrating that program's 40th anniversary).<ref name=EverySimpsonsEver>{{cite news|last1=Bradley|first1=Bill|title='The Simpsons' Launches on FXX With Longest Continuous Marathon Ever|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/09/simpsons-launches-on-fxx-longest-marathon_n_5120709.html|newspaper=The Huffington Post|access-date=August 19, 2014|date=April 9, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723124514/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/09/simpsons-launches-on-fxx-longest-marathon_n_5120709.html|archive-date=July 23, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=VH1 Celebrates 40 Years of 'Saturday Night Live' with 'SNL Rewind: 2015 – 1975′ Mega-Marathon|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/89273/vh1-saturday-night-live-rewind-marathon/|publisher=[[VH1]]|access-date=October 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218001634/http://www.vh1.com/news/89273/vh1-saturday-night-live-rewind-marathon/|archive-date=February 18, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The first day of the marathon was the highest rated broadcast day in the history of the network so far, the ratings more than tripled that those of regular prime time programming for FXX.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Kissell|first1=Rick|title='The Simpsons' Marathon More Than Triples Primetime Audience for FXX|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/the-simpsons-marathon-more-than-triples-primetime-audience-for-fxx-1201288542/|magazine=Variety|access-date=August 24, 2014|date=August 22, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824135117/http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/the-simpsons-marathon-more-than-triples-primetime-audience-for-fxx-1201288542/|archive-date=August 24, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Ratings during the first six nights of the marathon grew night after night, with the network ranking within the top 5 networks in basic cable each night.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kondolojy|first1=Amanda|title=FXX Paints Labor Day Weekend Yellow|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/08/28/fxx-paints-labor-day-weekend-yellow/297657/|publisher=[[TV By the Numbers]]|access-date=September 2, 2014|date=August 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906052136/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/08/28/fxx-paints-labor-day-weekend-yellow/297657/|archive-date=September 6, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> In [[Australia]], a marathon of every episode of the show (at the time) aired from December 16, 2019 to January 5, 2020 on [[Fox8]] (a cable network operated on pay TV provider [[Foxtel]] and a corporate sibling to the American Fox network).<ref>https://www.foxtel.com.au/watch/the-simpsons.html#:~:text=On%20FOX8&text=From%20December%2016th%20FOX8%20will,with%20a%2021%20day%20marathon.</ref>

In response, Brooks said, "I am furious with Matt,&nbsp;... he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far.&nbsp;... his behavior right now is rotten."<ref name="LATimes">{{cite news |title=Matt Groening's Reaction to The Critic's First Appearance on The Simpsons |author=Brennan, Judy |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=The Times Mirror Company |date=March 3, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Groening's point well-taken, but probably best made privately |author=Richmond, Ray |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |date=March 4, 1995}}</ref>

"[[The Principal and the Pauper]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 9)|season nine]], 1997) is one of the most controversial episodes of ''The Simpsons''. Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that [[Principal Skinner|Seymour Skinner]], a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by Groening and by [[Harry Shearer]], who provides the voice of Skinner. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, "That's ''so'' wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/shearer-delight/Content?oid=1065334 |title=Shearer Delight |author=Wilonsky, Robert |date=April 27, 2001 |access-date=April 15, 2009 |work=[[East Bay Express]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002203123/http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/shearer-delight/Content?oid=1065334 |archive-date=October 2, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In a subsequent interview in 2006, Shearer added, "Now, the writers refuse to talk about it.

It began by proving that cartoon characters don't have to be caricatures; they can be invested with real emotions. Now the show has in essence fermented into a limp parody of itself.

In 2016, popular culture writer Anna Leszkiewicz suggested that even though ''The Simpsons'' still holds cultural relevance, contemporary appeal is only for the first ten seasons, with recent episodes only garnering mainstream attention when a favorite character from the golden era is killed off, or when new information and shock twists are given for old characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2016/04/smithers-question-why-do-we-keep-retrofitting-progressive-narratives-pop|title=The Smithers question: why do we keep retrofitting progressive narratives in pop culture?|access-date=September 3, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612053455/http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2016/04/smithers-question-why-do-we-keep-retrofitting-progressive-narratives-pop|archive-date=June 12, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The series' ratings have also declined; while the first season enjoyed an average of 13.4&nbsp;million viewing households per episode in the U.S.,<ref name="season1ratings" /> the twenty-first season had an average of 7.2&nbsp;million viewers.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/05/full-series-rankings-for-the-2009-10-broadcast-season|title=Full Series Rankings for the 2009–10 Broadcast Season&nbsp;–|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=May 27, 2010|magazine=Deadline.com|access-date=December 22, 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HlF91VGV?url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/05/full-series-rankings-for-the-2009-10-broadcast-season|archive-date=June 30, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Alan Sepinwall]] and [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] argued in their 2016 book titled ''[[TV (The Book)]]'' that the peak of ''The Simpsons'' are "roughly seasons [three through twelve]", and that despite the decline, episodes from the later seasons such as "[[Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind]]" and "[[Holidays of Future Passed]]" could be considered on par with the earlier classic episodes, further stating that "even if you want to call the show today a thin shadow of its former self, think about how mind-boggingly great its former self had to be for so-diminished a version to be watchable at all."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sepinwall|first1=Alan|last2=Seitz|first2=Matt Zoller|title=TV (The Book): Two Experts Pick the Greatest American Shows of All Time|date=September 6, 2016|publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]]|isbn=978-1455588190|title-link=TV (The Book): Two Experts Pick the Greatest American Shows of All Time}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Seitz, Matt Zoller|author2-link=Alan Sepinwall|author2=Sepinwall, Alan|title=Why ''The Simpsons'' Is the Best TV Show Ever|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/09/tv-the-book-simpsons-best-television-show.html|website=[[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]|publisher=[[New York Media, LLC]]|access-date=October 17, 2016|date=September 6, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019041130/http://www.vulture.com/2016/09/tv-the-book-simpsons-best-television-show.html|archive-date=October 19, 2016|url-status=live|author1-link=Matt Zoller Seitz}}</ref>

In 2020, [[Uproxx]] writer Josh Kurp stated that while he agrees with the sentiment that ''The Simpsons'' is not as good as it used to be, it is because "it was working at a level of comedy and characterization that no show ever has." He felt there were still many reasons to watch the series, as it was "still capable of quality television, and even the occasional new classic" and the fact that the show was willing to experiment, giving examples such as bringing on guest animators like [[Don Hertzfeldt]] and [[Sylvain Chomet]] to produce couch gags, and guest writers like [[Seth Rogen]] and [[Evan Goldberg]], [[Pete Holmes]] and [[Megan Amram]] to write episodes.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kurp |first1=Josh |title=Making The Case For Still Watching 'The Simpsons' After 30-Plus Seasons |url=https://uproxx.com/tv/case-for-still-watching-the-simpsons/ |website=Uproxx |access-date=May 13, 2020}}</ref>

====Race controversy====
{{Further|Apu Nahasapeemapetilon#Accusations of racial stereotyping}}
The stereotypical nature of the character [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]] has long been the subject of controversy. This was particularly highlighted by Indian-American comedian [[Hari Kondabolu]]'s 2017 documentary ''[[The Problem with Apu]]''. In the film, Kondabolu states that as a child he was a fan of ''The Simpsons'' and liked Apu, but he now finds the character's stereotypical nature troublesome. Defenders of the character responded that the show is built on comical stereotypes, with creator Matt Groening saying, "that's the nature of cartooning."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/arts/television/simpsons-matt-groening-apu.html|work=New York Times|title='Simpsons' Creator Matt Groening Says Debate Around Apu Is 'Tainted'|access-date=July 18, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718142054/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/arts/television/simpsons-matt-groening-apu.html|archive-date=July 18, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> He added that he was "proud of what we do on the show", and "it's a time in our culture where people love to pretend they're offended".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/05/01/simpsons-creator-matt-groening-on-apu-controversy-people-love-to-pretend-theyre-offended.html|title='Simpsons' creator Matt Groening on Apu controversy: 'People love to pretend they're offended'|last=Lam|first=Katherine|date=May 1, 2018|publisher=Fox News|access-date=May 1, 2018|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501170222/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/05/01/simpsons-creator-matt-groening-on-apu-controversy-people-love-to-pretend-theyre-offended.html|archive-date=May 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In response to the controversy, Apu's voice actor, [[Hank Azaria]], said he was willing to step aside from his role as Apu: "The most important thing is to listen to South Asian people, Indian people in this country when they talk about what they feel and how they think about this character."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/25/entertainment/hank-azaria-apu/index.html|title=Hank Azaria willing to 'step aside' from playing Apu on 'The Simpsons'|author=Lisa Respers France|publisher=CNN|access-date=May 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502064415/https://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/25/entertainment/hank-azaria-apu/index.html|archive-date=May 2, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In February 2020, he confirmed that he would no longer voice Apu. Groening stated at the same time that the character would remain in the show.

The criticisms were referenced in the season 29 episode "[[No Good Read Goes Unpunished]]", when Lisa breaks the [[fourth wall]] and addresses the audience by saying, "Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?" to which Marge replies, "Some things will be addressed at a later date." Lisa adds, "If at all." This reference was clarified by the fact that there was a framed photo of Apu with the caption on the photo saying "Don't have a cow, Apu", a play on Bart's catchphrase "Don't have a cow, man," as well as the fact that [[Hindus]] do not eat cows as they are considered sacred. In October 2018, it was reported that Apu would be written out of the show,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/the-simpsons-indian-character-apu-axed-after-racial-controversy-11537982|title=The Simpsons Indian character Apu 'axed' after racial controversy|publisher=Sky News|access-date=October 29, 2018|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030035450/https://news.sky.com/story/the-simpsons-indian-character-apu-axed-after-racial-controversy-11537982|archive-date=October 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> which Groening denied.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/apu-wont-be-written-off-the-simpsons-2542154|title='The Simpsons' confirm Apu won't be axed after all|work=NME|date=August 27, 2019|access-date=March 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219103705/https://www.nme.com/news/apu-wont-be-written-off-the-simpsons-2542154|archive-date=December 19, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The popularity of ''The Simpsons'' has made it a billion-dollar merchandising industry.<ref name="mikescully"/> The title family and supporting characters appear on everything from T-shirts to posters. ''The Simpsons'' has been used as a theme for special editions of well-known board games, including [[Cluedo|Clue]], [[Scrabble]], [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], [[Operation (game)|Operation]], and [[The Game of Life]], as well as the [[trivia]] games What Would Homer Do? and Simpsons ''[[Jeopardy!]]''. Several card games such as [[Trump (card games)|trump cards]] and The Simpsons Trading Card Game have also been released. Many official or unofficial ''Simpsons'' books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years.
