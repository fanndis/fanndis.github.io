Their first match occurred during the 2007 [[Kremlin Cup]], with Zvonareva winning in straight sets. The two did not play again until the 2011 season, when Radwańska won four of their five matches, including the finals of the Mercury Insurance Open and the Pan Pacific Open.

"I’m not sure if I invented it," says Radwanska, "but I was definitely one of the first ones. When I watch TV, I can hear commentators say that was my shot, even if someone else is playing, so it’s nice to hear I can put something new into tennis".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2016/06/21/wimbledon-2016-tennis-junkie-agnieszka-radwanska-relishing-retur/|title=Wimbledon 2016: Tennis junkie Agnieszka Radwanska relishing return to grass|work=telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>

[[File:Agnieszka Radwanska (9431591516).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Radwańska hitting a [[Tweener (tennis)|tweener]] shot]]
One of Radwańska's main weaknesses is her lack of power in her serve. Her serve, especially her second serve, is generally slow and vulnerable to attack. Her shots sometimes lack penetration on court, posing little threat to power hitters.<ref name="SportsIllustrated">{{cite news |title=The Toss: Can Agnieszka Radwanska take her game to next level? |publisher=SI |accessdate=1 March 2012 |url=http://tennis.si.com/2012/03/01/the-toss-can-agnieszka-radwanska-take-her-game-to-next-level/}}</ref><ref name="Australian Open SWOT Analysis">{{cite news |title=AO SWOT #8 Agnieszka Radwanska |publisher=Australian Open |accessdate=21 December 2012 |url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/news/articles/2012-12-21/201212201356003427911.html}}</ref> "I don't think I can ever serve 200 kilometers per hour, it's just not my body," Radwańska said. "I have to do something else. I was just born to play like this. I have so many ideas. In your mind it's like, 'OK, I go down the line, then crosscourt, maybe drop shot.' But you have just one second, or even not one second, it just has to be automatic." Radwańska merely exhales when she strikes the ball, rather than loudly grunting like many of her peers. She bounces the ball no more than four times before serving. She says she can play with any racket and likes to use one for an entire match, unlike most players, who routinely grab frames with fresh strings.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304211804577502780985880106 |title=The Subtlest Player at Wimbledon |work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>

Tennis commentators, including former pro [[Wojciech Fibak]], have compared her playing style to that of [[Martina Hingis]], with Fibak describing her as "a natural mover who understands the geometry of the court".<ref>{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Clarey |title=New Words on Women's Tennis Tour – Polish Spoken Here |work=The New York Times |date=20 June 2009 |accessdate=24 April 2011 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/sports/tennis/21polish.html}}</ref> Radwańska cited Hingis as an inspiration.<ref name=Miami /> She and Hingis had their lone tour meeting in 2007, with Radwańska winning in three sets.<ref name=Miami />

Radwańska played with the [[Babolat]] Pure Drive Lite racquets until the end of the 2016 season. At the start of the 2017 season, beginning with the [[WTA Shenzhen Open|Shenzhen Open]] tournament, Radwańska started playing with a new tennis racket, made by the Japanese manufacturer, [[Srixon]]. Other tennis players who also use Srixon rackets include [[Kevin Anderson (tennis)|Kevin Anderson]], [[Misaki Doi]], [[Kurumi Nara]], [[Zarina Diyas]] and [[Magda Linette]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sport.pl/tenis/1,64987,21194172,agnieszka-radwanska-ma-nowa-rakiete.html|title=Agnieszka Radwańska ma nową rakietę|work=sport.pl}}</ref> For her on court tennis apparel, Radwańska is currently sponsored by [[Lotto Sport Italia]].<ref name=profile />

===Coaches===
Radwańska began her tennis career with her father, Robert Radwański, as her coach. She stated: "My dad was traveling with me all my life and we practiced together for 17 years, almost actually 18. So it's pretty long time."<ref>{{cite web |author1=Matt Cronin |title=Radwanska's dad goes from coach to tourist |url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2012/03/radwanskas-dad-goes-from-coach-to-tourist/35216/ |website=www.tennis.com |publisher=Tennis.com |date=30 March 2012}}</ref>

In 2011, Radwańska began working with [[Fed Cup]] coach Tomasz Wiktorowski, who replaced her father.

Radwańska hired [[Martina Navratilova]] as part of her team at the conclusion of the 2014 season. In April 2015 they parted ways after Navratilova stated that she was too busy to continue in her part-time role as Radwańska's consulting coach.<ref name="edition.cnn.com">{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/25/tennis/martina-navratilova-radwanska-tennis/ |title=Martina Navratilova ends coaching role with Radwanska – CNN.com |author=Gary Morley, CNN |date=25 April 2015 |work=CNN |accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>

==Sponsors==
After years of expressing her love for the American restaurant chain [[Cheesecake Factory]], Radwańska became the restaurant's first sports endorsement in 2014. Radwańska began to wear the Cheesecake Factory's logo on her visor at the start of the [[2014 BNP Paribas Open]]. Additionally, she will continue to wear the company logo during all of her matches played in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tennisworldusa.org/Radwanska-Signs-Endorsement-Deal-with-Cheesecake-Factory-articolo16509.html |title=Radwanska Signs Endorsement Deal with Cheesecake Factory |accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>

On 1 January 2014 Radwańska became a global ambassador for the luxury watch manufacturer [[Rado (watch)|Rado]].

Radwańska also has a partnership agreement with [[Lexus]]. As a result of this sponsorship Lexus logo appears on Agnieszka's court dress in all the Grand Slam tournaments, the Masters tournament and in selected tournaments rank Premier and Premier Mandatory. Additionally, Radwańska is currently driving the latest Lexus model – LS limousine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.toyota.eu/newsrelease.do;jsessionid=7214D0B86E84A9463D63C1474339F20D?&id=3137&mid=1 |title=Toyota Europe News |work=Totota Europe |accessdate=6 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410015929/http://newsroom.toyota.eu/newsrelease.do/ |archive-date=10 April 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

On 6 January 2015 Radwańska signed a personal endorsement deal with financial management and HR software company [[Workday, Inc.]] The Pleasanton, California-based company announced the deal on its Twitter feed and Radwańska sported the Workday logo on her dress as she beat Great Britain's [[Heather Watson]] in a [[Hopman Cup]] match in Australia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/aga_radwanska_signs_workday_endorsement |title=Aga Radwanska signs Workday endorsement |accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>

==Charitable work==
Since 2009, Radwańska and her sister Urszula have devoted time during the off-season to Szlachetna Paczka ("Noble Box"). The charity has its volunteers go door-to-door throughout the year compiling a database of families in need, asking them what would help ease the pressures of the holidays. Then, for a three-week period from mid-November to early December, donors are given a list to take with them to the supermarket, where they fill a shopping cart with the food, clothing and more to donate to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agaradwanska.com/news/262,agas-charitable-spirit.html |title=Aga's Charitable Spirit – News – Agnieszka Radwańska |accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>

Additionally, she and Urszula offer their support to [[Habitat for Humanity]] and its project in Warsaw. As Habitat for Humanity ambassador Radwańska stated, "It's an honor to be a part of such a fantastic cause and be involved with Habitat for Humanity, helping underprivileged families across the world. I have great respect for all the volunteers and those working hard everyday against poverty housing."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.habitat.org/stories_multimedia/volunteer_stories/poland_may_tennis_players.aspx |title=Poland May Tennis Players  |accessdate=2015-01-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113033357/http://www.habitat.org/stories_multimedia/volunteer_stories/poland_may_tennis_players.aspx |archivedate=13 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
