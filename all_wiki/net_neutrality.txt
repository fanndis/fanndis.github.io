{{Net neutrality}}
{{Internet}}
'''Network neutrality''', most commonly called '''net neutrality''', is the principle that [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) must treat all [[Internet]] [[communication]]s equally, and not discriminate or charge differently based on [[user (computing)|user]], [[web content|content]], [[website]], [[computing platform|platform]], [[application software|application]], type of equipment, source address, destination address, or method of communication.<ref name=":2032">{{Cite document|title=Easley, R., Guo, H., Krämer, J. - From Net Neutrality to Data Neutrality, Information Systems Research 29(2):253–272|language=en-US|ssrn = 2666217}}</ref><ref>{{cite report | first=Angele A. | last=Gilroy | title=Access to Broadband Networks: The Net Neutrality Debate | page=1 | publisher=DIANE Publishing | isbn=978-1437984545 | date=11 March 2011}}</ref>

With net neutrality, ISPs may not intentionally [[IP address blocking|block]], [[bandwidth throttling|slow down]], or charge money for specific online content. Without net neutrality, ISPs may prioritize certain types of traffic, meter others, or potentially block traffic from specific services, while charging consumers for various tiers of service.

The term was coined by [[Columbia University]] [[media law]] professor [[Tim Wu]] in 2003, as an extension of the longstanding concept of a [[common carrier]], which was used to describe the role of telephone systems.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF|title=Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination|journal=Journal on Telecom and High Tech Law|author=Tim Wu|year=2003|access-date=23 April 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424062409/http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF|archive-date=24 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="kraemer-def">{{cite journal|last1=Kramer|first1=J|last2=Wiewiorra|first2=L.|last3=Weinhardt|first3=C.|date=2013|url=http://www.im.uni-karlsruhe.de/Upload/Publications/336c39b3-7a62-4159-bb1a-483f39dd5b24.pdf|title=Net Neutrality: A Progress Report|journal=Telecommunications Policy|volume=37|number=9|pages=794–813|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6YjuB9cRc?url=http://www.im.uni-karlsruhe.de/Upload/Publications/336c39b3-7a62-4159-bb1a-483f39dd5b24.pdf|archive-date=23 May 2015|doi=10.1016/j.telpol.2012.08.005|citeseerx=10.1.1.258.5878}}</ref><ref name="berners-lee-def">{{cite web |url=http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/144 |title=Net Neutrality: This is Serious |access-date=26 December 2008 |last=Berners-Lee |first=Tim |author-link=Tim Berners-Lee |date=21 June 2006 |website=timbl's blog |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227100511/http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/144 |archive-date=27 December 2008}}</ref><ref name="nn-for-google-users">{{cite web |author=Staff |url= https://www.google.com/help/netneutrality.html |title=A Guide to Net Neutrality for Google Users |access-date=7 December 2008 |website=[[Google]] |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901084929/https://www.google.com/help/netneutrality.html }}</ref> Net neutrality regulations may be referred to as "common carrier" regulations.<ref name="auto2">Jensen, Cory.

Proponents of net neutrality, which include [[computer science]] experts, [[consumer advocate]]s, [[human rights organization]]s, and Internet content providers claim that net neutrality helps to provide freedom of information exchange, promotes competition and innovation for Internet services, and upholds standardization of Internet data transmission which was essential for its growth. Opponents of net neutrality, which include ISPs, and telecom equipment manufacturers, assert that net neutrality requirements would reduce their incentive to build out the Internet, reduces competition in the marketplace, and may raise their operating costs which they would have to pass along to their users.

Net neutrality is administered on a national or regional basis, though much of the world's focus has been on the conflict over [[net neutrality in the United States]]. Net neutrality in the US has been a topic since the early 1990s, as they were one of the world leaders in online service providing. In 2019, the Save the Internet Act to "guarantee broadband internet users equal access to online content" was passed by the United States House of Representatives<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/technology/net-neutrality-vote.html</ref> but not by the US Senate. However, they face the same problems as the rest of the world. Finding an appropriate solution to creating more regulation for Internet Service Providers has been a major work in progress.

==Definition and related principles==
===Internet neutrality===

Network neutrality is the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/132075/2008/02/netneutrality1.html|title=Inside Net Neutrality: Is your ISP filtering content?|access-date=26 December 2008|last=Honan|first=Matthew|date=12 February 2008|work=MacWorld|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218093225/http://www.macworld.com/article/132075/2008/02/netneutrality1.html|archive-date=18 December 2008}}</ref> Internet traffic includes all of the different messages, files and data sent over the Internet, including, for example, [[email]]s, [[digital audio]] files, [[digital video]] files, etc. According to [[Columbia Law School]] professor [[Tim Wu]], the best way to explain network neutrality is that a public information network will be most useful if all content, websites, and platforms (e.g., mobile devices, video game consoles, etc.) are treated equally.<ref name="wu-def">{{cite web|url=http://timwu.org/network_neutrality.html|title=Network Neutrality FAQ|access-date=26 December 2008|last=Wu|first=Tim|author-link=Tim Wu|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141832/http://timwu.org/network_neutrality.html|archive-date=16 December 2008}}</ref>

Net Neutrality creates a flat world among companies and supports a level playing field. The internet holds the entire sum of human knowledge and when this knowledge is open and accessible to all, there is net neutrality. Net neutrality is regularly threatened and serves as a moral stance in society. The internet was designed to transfer packets of information freely, no matter what their content. <ref>[https://www.popsci.com/net-neutrality-is-under-attack-heres-why-we-need-to-protect-it/]</ref> 

Net neutrality is the principle that an internet service provider (ISP) has to provide access to all sites, content and applications at the same speed, under the same conditions without blocking or preferencing any content. Under net neutrality, whether you connect to Netflix, Internet Archive, or a friend's blog, your ISP has to treat them all the same.<ref>[https://www.thestreet.com/technology/what-is-net-neutrality-14816850]</ref> Without net neutrality, an ISP can decide what information you are exposed to. This could cause an increase in monetary charges for companies such as Netflix in order to stream their content. <ref>[https://www.popsci.com/net-neutrality-is-under-attack-heres-why-we-need-to-protect-it/]</ref>

A more detailed proposed definition of technical and service network neutrality suggests that service network neutrality is the loyalty to the paradigm that operation of a service at a certain layer is not influenced by any data other than the data interpreted at that layer, and in accordance with the protocol specification for that layer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbarel.com/analysis/policy/what-is-network-neutrality|title=Protecting Network Neutrality: Both Important and Hard|author=Hagai Bar-El|access-date=19 August 2014|website=hbarel.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820033907/http://www.hbarel.com/analysis/policy/what-is-network-neutrality|archive-date=20 August 2014}}</ref>

===Open Internet===
Under an "open Internet" system, the full resources of the Internet and means to operate on it should be easily accessible to all individuals, companies, and organizations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/unpacked/2017/09/15/what-is-the-open-internet-rule|title=What is the Open Internet Rule?|last=Wheeler|first=Tom|date=15 September 2017|website=Brookings|access-date=27 October 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028201703/https://www.brookings.edu/blog/unpacked/2017/09/15/what-is-the-open-internet-rule/|archive-date=28 October 2017}}</ref>

Applicable concepts include: net neutrality, [[open standard]]s, [[Transparency (telecommunication)|transparency]], lack of [[Internet censorship]], and low [[barriers to entry]]. The concept of the open Internet is sometimes expressed as an expectation of [[Decentralization#Technological decentralization|decentralized technological power]], and is seen by some observers as closely related to [[open-source software]], a type of software program whose maker allows users access to the code that runs the program, so that users can improve the software or fix [[bug (computing)|bugs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2012/03/23/open-vs-closed-what-kind-of-internet-do-we-want|title=Open vs. closed: What kind of internet do we want?|website=GigaOm|author=Ingram, Mathew|date=23 March 2012|access-date=8 June 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528071158/http://gigaom.com/2012/03/23/open-vs-closed-what-kind-of-internet-do-we-want/|archive-date=28 May 2014}}</ref>

Proponents of net neutrality see this as an important component of an "open Internet", wherein policies such as equal treatment of data and open [[web standards]] allow those using the Internet to easily communicate, and conduct business and activities without interference from a third party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/about-open-internet|title=About the Open Internet|website=European Commission|access-date=23 April 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424065845/http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/about-open-internet|archive-date=24 April 2014}}</ref>

In contrast, a "closed Internet" refers to the opposite situation, wherein established persons, corporations, or governments favor certain uses, restrict access to necessary [[web standards]], [[Traffic shaping|artificially degrade]] some services, or explicitly [[Internet censorship|filter out content]]. Some countries such as Thailand block certain websites or types of sites, and monitor and/or censor Internet use using [[Internet police]], a specialized type of [[law enforcement]], or [[secret police]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://2bangkok.com/blocked.shtml|title=Website Censorship in Thailand – 2008-2011 {{!}} 2Bangkok.com|last=admin|website=2bangkok.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-14}}</ref> Other countries such as Russia,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2016/russia|title=Russia|date=2016-11-10|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref> China,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/3.htm|title="Race to the Bottom": Corporate Complicity in Chinese Internet Censorship: II.

In comparison to the United States or Canada for example, these countries have far more restrictive internet service providers. This approach is reminiscent of a Closed Platform system, as both ideas are highly similar.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tåg|first=Joacim|date=April 2008|title=Open Versus Closed Platforms|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f672/bc06ea9b47994a0677f8eaa088a86699b525.pdf|journal=Open Versus Closed Platforms|volume=209|pages=18|s2cid=33240943}}</ref> These systems all serve to hinder access to a wide variety of internet service, which is a stark contrast to the idea of an open Internet system.

===Dumb pipe===
The term "dumb pipe" was coined in the early 1990s and refers water pipes used in a city water supply system. In theory, these pipes provide a steady and reliable source of water to every household without discrimination.  In other words, it connects the user with the source without any intelligence or decrement. Similar to this, A dumb network is a network with little or no control or management of its use patterns. <ref>L.DE MUYTER, Y. DESMEDT, “Net Neutrality-from Catch-all to Catch-22” (2012) in A. STROWEL, Net
Neutrality in Europe/ La neutralité de l’InternetInternet en Europe, Bruylant, Brussels, 2013, p.57</ref>

In a dumb network, the endpoints are thought to be where the [[intelligence]] lies, and as such, proponents argue that the network should leave the management and operation of communications and data transfer to the [[end user]]s, not a government bureau or Internet company.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In 2013, the software company [[MetroTech Net, Inc.]] (MTN) coined the term "dumb wave", which is the 2010s-era application of the "dumb pipe" concept to the ubiquitous [[wireless network]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Experts in the [[High tech|high-technology]] field will often compare the dumb pipe concept with intelligent networks –also known as [[smart pipe]]s—and debate which one is best applied to a certain portion of Internet policy. These conversations usually refer to these two concepts as being analogous to the concepts of open and closed Internet respectively.<ref name=":0">Thierer, Adam. (2006) Are "Dumb Pipe" Mandates Smart Public Policy? Vertical Integration, Net Neutrality, and the Network Layers Model. In: Lenard T.M., May R.J. (eds) Net Neutrality or Net Neutering: Should Broadband Internet Services be Regulated. Springer, Boston, MA</ref> As such, certain models have been made that aim to outline four layers of the Internet with the understanding of the dumb pipe theory:
* Content Layer: Contains services such as communication as well as entertainment videos and music.
* Applications Layer: Contains services such as e-mail and web browsers.
* Logical Layer (Also called the Code Layer): Contains various Internet protocols such as [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]].
* Physical Layer: Consists of services that provide all others such as cable or wireless connections.<ref name=":0" />

===End-to-end principle===
The [[end-to-end principle]] of [[network planning and design|network design]] was first laid out in the 1981 paper ''End-to-end arguments in system design'' by [[Jerome H. Saltzer]], [[David P. Reed]], and [[David D. Clark]]. The principle states that, whenever possible, [[communications protocol]] operations should be defined to occur at the end-points of a communications system, or as close as possible to the resources being controlled. According to the end-to-end principle, protocol features are only justified in the lower layers of a system if they are a performance optimization; hence, [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] retransmission for reliability is still justified, but efforts to improve TCP reliability should stop after peak performance has been reached.

They argued that reliable systems tend to require end-to-end processing to operate correctly, in addition to any processing in the intermediate system. They pointed out that most features in the lowest level of a communications system have costs for all higher-layer clients, even if those clients do not need the features, and are redundant if the clients have to re-implement the features on an end-to-end basis. This leads to the model of a minimal [[dumb network]] with smart terminals, a completely different model from the previous paradigm of the smart network with [[dumb terminal]]s. Because the end-to-end principle is one of the central design principles of the Internet, and because the practical means for implementing data discrimination violate the end-to-end principle, the principle often enters discussions about net neutrality. The end-to-end principle is closely related, and sometimes seen as a direct precursor to the principle of net neutrality.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/the-best-writing-on-net-neutrality/361237/ |title=Net Neutrality: A Guide to (and History of) a Contested Idea |work=The Atlantic |author1=Alexis C.

===Traffic shaping===
[[Traffic shaping]] is the control of [[computer network]] traffic to optimize or guarantee performance, improve [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] (i.e., decrease Internet response times), and/or increase usable [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] by delaying [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] that meet certain criteria.<ref>[[:rfc:2475#section-2.3.3.3|IETF RFC 2475]] "An Architecture for Differentiated Services" section 2.3.3.3 – definition of "Shaper"</ref> In practice, traffic shaping is often accomplished by [[Bandwidth throttling|throttling]] certain types of data, such as [[streaming video]] or [[peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P]] file sharing. More specifically, traffic shaping is any action on a set of packets (often called a stream or a flow) which imposes additional delay on those packets such that they conform to some predetermined constraint (a contract or traffic profile).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-I.371-200403-I/en |title=ITU-T I.371: Traffic control and congestion control in B-ISDN |author=tsbmail |access-date=14 September 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220063807/http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-I.371-200403-I/en |archive-date=20 December 2014}}</ref> Traffic shaping provides a means to control the volume of traffic being sent into a [[computer network|network]] in a specified period ([[bandwidth throttling]]), or the maximum rate at which the traffic is sent ([[rate limiting]]), or more complex criteria such as [[generic cell rate algorithm]].

===Over-provisioning===
If the core of a network has more bandwidth than is permitted to enter at the edges, then good quality of service (QoS) can be obtained without policing or throttling. For example, telephone networks employ admission control to limit user demand on the network core by refusing to create a circuit for the requested connection. During a [[natural disaster]], for example, most users will get a [[circuit busy]] signal if they try to make a call, as the phone company prioritizes emergency calls. Over-provisioning is a form of [[statistical multiplexing]] that makes liberal estimates of [[Peak demand|peak user demand]]. Over-provisioning is used in private networks such as [[WebEx]] and the [[Abilene Network|Internet 2 Abilene Network]], an American university network. David Isenberg believes that continued over-provisioning will always provide more capacity for less expense than QoS and [[deep packet inspection]] technologies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://isen.com/blog/2007/07/research-on-costs-of-net-neutrality.html |title=Research on Costs of Net Neutrality |access-date=26 December 2008 |last=Isenberg |first=David |date=2 July 2007 |website=isen.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216143441/http://isen.com/blog/2007/07/research-on-costs-of-net-neutrality.html |archive-date=16 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/Deep-packet-inspection-meets-net-neutrality.ars/3 |title=Deep packet inspection meets 'Net neutrality, CALEA |access-date=26 December 2008 |last=Anderson |first=Nate |date=25 July 2007 |work=Ars Technica |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216142243/http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/Deep-packet-inspection-meets-net-neutrality.ars/3 |archive-date=16 December 2008}}</ref>

===Device neutrality===
[[Device neutrality]] is the principle that in order to ensure freedom of choice and freedom of communication for users of network-connected devices, it is not sufficient that network operators do not interfere with their choices and activities; users must be free to use applications of their choice and hence remove the applications they do not want.

It can be defined with the following analogy to network neutrality:

Network neutrality: Neutrality principles are codified ''[[ex-ante]]'', and a judicial route is available for redress. Connectivity providers can implement traffic management, but the rules must be the same for everyone. The antitrust alternative, takes more time and offers few precedents.

Device neutrality: Similarly, neutrality principles are codified ''ex-ante'' and avail judicial remedies. Device vendors can establish policies for managing applications, but they, too, must be applied neutrally.

An unsuccessful bill to enforce network and device neutrality was introduced in Italy in 2015 by Hon. [[Stefano Quintarelli]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hermescenter.org/net-neutrality-device-neutrality/ |title=After Net Neutrality, Device Neutrality |access-date=20 March 2018 |date=4 December 2017 |website=hermescenter.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102212402/https://www.hermescenter.org/net-neutrality-device-neutrality/ |archive-date=2 January 2018 }}</ref> The law gained formal support at the European Commission<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/tris/en/search/?trisaction=search.detail&year=2017&num=498#contrib

=== Invoicing and tariffs ===
ISPs have the possibility to choose a balance between a base subscription tariff (monthly bundle) and a pay-per-use (pay by MB metering). The ISP sets an upper monthly threshold on data usage, just to be able to provide an equal share amongst customers, and a fair use guarantee. This is generally not considered to be an intrusion, but rather allows for a commercial positioning amongst ISPs.

=== Alternative Networks ===
Some networks like [[Municipal wireless network|public Wi-Fi]], or [[Loon LLC|Google Loon]] can take traffic away from conventional [[Telecommunications network|fixed]] or [[Cellular network|mobile network]] providers. This can significantly change the end-to-end behaviour (performance, tariffs).

In a practice called [[zero-rating]], companies will not invoice data use related to certain IP addresses, favoring use of those services.

Sometimes Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will charge some companies, but not others, for the traffic they cause on the ISP's network. French telecom operator Orange, complaining that traffic from [[YouTube]] and other [[Google]] sites consist of roughly 50% of total traffic on the Orange network, made a deal with Google, in which they charge Google for the traffic incurred on the Orange network.<ref>{{cite web |last=Robertson |first=Adi |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/19/3894182/french-isp-orange-says-google-pays-to-send-traffic |title=French ISP Orange says it's making Google pay to send traffic over its network |website=The Verge |date=2013-01-19 |access-date=14 January 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116074203/http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/19/3894182/french-isp-orange-says-google-pays-to-send-traffic |archive-date=16 January 2014}}</ref> Some also thought that Orange's rival ISP Free throttled YouTube traffic. However, an investigation done by the French telecommunications regulatory body revealed that the network was simply congested during peak hours.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.arcep.fr/index.php?id=8571&L=1&tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Buid%5D=1619&tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Bannee%5D=&tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Btheme%5D=&tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Bmotscle%5D=&tx_gsactualite_pi1%5BbackID%5D=26&cHash=8d42d6993c018a12924d83cf72e3bd36|website=arcep.fr|title=ARCEP closes the administrative inquiry involving several companies, including Free and Google, on the technical and financial terms governing IP traffic routing.|date=19 July 2013|access-date=18 January 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201162548/http://www.arcep.fr/index.php?id=8571&L=1&tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Buid%5D=1619&tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Bannee%5D=&tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Btheme%5D=&tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Bmotscle%5D=&tx_gsactualite_pi1%5BbackID%5D=26&cHash=8d42d6993c018a12924d83cf72e3bd36|archive-date=1 February 2014}}</ref>

Aside from the zero-rating method, ISPs will also use certain strategies to reduce costs of pricing plans such as the use of sponsored data. In a scenario where a sponsored data plan is used, a third-party will step in and pay for all the content that it (or the carrier or consumer) does not want around. This is generally used as a way for ISP's to remove [[Out-of-pocket expense|out-of-pocket]] costs from subscribers.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2016.10.002 | volume=41 | title=Grey nuances in the black and white debate over subsidized Internet access | year=2017 | journal=Telecommunications Policy | pages=1017–1026 | last1 = Frieden | first1 = Rob| issue=10 }}</ref>

One of the criticisms regarding discrimination is that the system set up by ISPs for this purpose is capable of not only discriminating but also scrutinizing full-packet content of communications. For instance, the deep packet inspection technology installs intelligence within the lower layers in the work to discover and identify the source, type, and destination of packets, revealing information about packets traveling in the physical infrastructure so it can dictate the quality of transport such packet will receive.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Research on Telecommunications Planning and Management for Business|url=https://archive.org/details/handbookresearch00leei_023|url-access=limited|last=Lee|first=In|publisher=Information Science Reference|year=2009|isbn=9781605661940|location=Hershey, PA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookresearch00leei_023/page/n189 135]}}</ref> This is seen as an architecture of [[surveillance]], one that can be shared with [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]], copyrighted content owners, and civil litigants, exposing the users' secrets in the process.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Law, Policy, and Technology: Cyberterrorism, Information Warfare, and Internet Immobilization: Cyberterrorism, Information Warfare, and Internet Immobilization|last1=Reich|first1=Pauline|last2=Gelbstein|first2=Eduardo|publisher=IGI Global|year=2012|isbn=9781615208319|location=Hershey, PA|pages=229}}</ref>

===Favoring private networks===
Proponents of net neutrality argue that without new regulations, Internet service providers would be able to profit from and favor their own private protocols over others. ISPs are able to encourage the use of specific services by using private networks to discriminate what data is counted against bandwidth caps. For example, Comcast struck a deal with Microsoft that allowed users to stream television through the Xfinity app on their [[Xbox 360]]s without it affecting their bandwidth limit. However, utilizing other television [[streaming media|streaming]] apps, such as [[Netflix]], [[HBO Go]], and [[Hulu]], counted towards the limit. Comcast denied that this infringed on net neutrality principles since "it runs its Xfinity for Xbox service on its own, private Internet protocol network".<ref>{{cite news|url= http://fortune.com/2012/05/16/is-comcast-violating-net-neutrality-rules/|author= Mitchell, Dan|title= Is Comcast violating net-neutrality rules?|work= Fortune|date= May 2012|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151115140002/http://fortune.com/2012/05/16/is-comcast-violating-net-neutrality-rules/|archive-date= 15 November 2015}}</ref> In 2009, when [[AT&T]] was bundling [[iPhone 3G]] with its 3G network service, the company placed restrictions on which iPhone applications could run on its network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=PRASAD|first1=ROHIT|last2=SRIDHAR|first2=V|date=2014|title=The Economics of Net Neutrality|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=49|issue=16|pages=52–58|jstor=24480155|issn=0012-9976}}</ref> According to proponents of net neutrality, this capitalization on which content producers ISPs can favor would ultimately lead to fragmentation, where some ISPs would have certain content that is not necessarily present in the networks offered by other ISPs. The danger behind fragmentation, as viewed by proponents of net neutrality, is the concept that there could be "multiple 'Internets,'" where some ISPs offer exclusive internet applications or services or make it more difficult to gain access internet content that may be more easily viewable through other internet service providers. An example of a fragmented service would be television, where some cable providers offer exclusive media from certain content providers.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Robin S|last2=Wu|first2=Tim|date=2009-08-01|title=Subsidizing Creativity through Network Design: Zero-Pricing and Net Neutrality|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=23|issue=3|pages=61–76|doi=10.1257/jep.23.3.61|issn=0895-3309|url=https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/1601}}</ref> However, in theory, allowing ISPs to favor certain content and private networks would overall improve internet services since they would be able to recognize packets of information that are more time-sensitive and prioritize that over packets that are not as sensitive to latency. The issue, as explained by Robin S. Lee and Tim Wu, is that there are literally too many ISPs and internet content providers around the world to reach an agreement on how to standardize that prioritization. A proposed solution would be to allow all online content to be accessed and transferred freely, while simultaneously offering a "fast lane" for a preferred service that does not discriminate on the content provider.<ref name=":02" />

===Peering discrimination===
There is disagreement about whether [[peering]] is a net neutrality issue.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-02-24/netflixs-deal-with-comcast-isnt-about-net-neutrality-except-that-it-is|title=Netflix's Deal With Comcast Isn't About Net Neutrality—Except That It Is|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|author=Joshua Brustein|date=24 February 2014|access-date=18 November 2014|work=BusinessWeek|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915030202/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-02-24/netflixs-deal-with-comcast-isnt-about-net-neutrality-except-that-it-is|archive-date=15 September 2014}}</ref> In the first quarter of 2014, streaming website Netflix reached an arrangement with ISP Comcast to improve the quality of its service to Netflix clients.<ref>{{cite news|author=Waniata, Ryan|title=Comcast Jumps up in Netflix Speed Rankings after Payola-style Agreement|work=Digital Trends|date= 14 April 2014}}</ref> This arrangement was made in response to increasingly slow connection speeds through Comcast over the course of 2013, where average speeds dropped by over 25% of their values a year before to an all-time low. After the deal was struck in January 2014, the Netflix speed index recorded a 66% increase in connection. [[Netflix]] agreed to a similar deal with [[Verizon]] in 2014, after Verizon [[DSL]] customers' connection speed dropped to less than 1 Mbit/s early in the year. Netflix spoke out against this deal with a controversial statement delivered to all Verizon customers experiencing low connection speeds, using the Netflix client.<ref>{{cite news|author=Waniata, Ryan|title=Netflix Calls Verizon out on the Big Red Screen [Update: Netflix Backs Off]|work= Digital Trends|date= 9 June 2014}}</ref> This sparked an internal debate between the two companies that led to Verizon's obtaining a [[cease and desist]] order on 5 June 2014 that forced Netflix to stop displaying this message.

===Favoring fast-loading websites===
Pro-net neutrality arguments have also noted that regulations are also necessary due to research that has shown low-tolerance to slow-loading content providers. In a 2009 research study conducted by Forrester Research, online shoppers expected the web pages they visited to download content instantly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html|title=Impatient Web Users Flee Slow-Loading Sites|last=Lohr|first=Steve|date=2012-02-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-04|issn=0362-4331|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304193720/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html|archive-date=4 March 2017}}</ref> When a page fails to load at the expected speed, many of them simply click out.

==By country==
{{Main|Net neutrality by country}}
Governments of countries which comment on net neutrality usually support the concept.

===United States===
{{Main|Net neutrality in the United States}}
[[Net neutrality in the United States]] has been a point of conflict between network users and service providers since the 1990s. Much of the conflict over net neutrality arises from how Internet services are classified by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) under authority of the [[Communications Act of 1934]]. The FCC would have significant ability to regulate ISPs should Internet services be treated as a Title II "[[common carrier]] service", or otherwise the ISPs would be mostly unrestricted by the FCC if Internet services fell under Title I "information services". In 2009, the United States Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 2009, which granted a stimulus of $2.88 billion for extending broadband services into certain areas of the United States. It was intended to make the internet more accessible for under-served areas, and aspects of net neutrality and open access were written into the grant. However, the bill never set any significant precedents for net neutrality or influenced future legislation relating to net neutrality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Daniels|first=Lesley-Ann|date=2016-04-08|title=Tras el velo del antiterrorismo|journal=Revista CIDOB d' Afers Internacionals|issue=112|pages=255–257|doi=10.24241/rcai.2016.112.1.255|issn=1133-6595|doi-access=free}}</ref> Through 2017, the FCC has generally been favorable towards net neutrality, treating ISPs under Title II common carrier. With the onset of the [[Presidency of Donald Trump]] in 2017, and the appointment of [[Ajit Pai]], an opponent of net neutrality, to the chairman of the FCC, the FCC has reversed many previous net neutrality rulings, and reclassified Internet services as Title I information services.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet/u-s-net-neutrality-rules-will-end-on-june-11-fcc-idUSKBN1IB1UN|title=U.S. 'net neutrality' rules will expire on June 11: FCC|first=David|last=Shepardson|agency=Reuters|date=2018-05-10}}</ref> The FCC's decisions have been a matter of several ongoing legal challenges by both states supporting net neutrality, and ISPs challenging it. The United States Congress has attempted to pass legislation supporting net neutrality but have failed to gain sufficient support. In 2018, a bill cleared the U.S. Senate, with Republicans [[Lisa Murkowski]], [[John Kennedy (Louisiana politician)|John Kennedy]] and [[Susan Collins]] joining all 49 Democrats but the House majority denied the bill a hearing.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/senate-approves-measure-to-save-net-neutrality/|title=Senate votes to save net neutrality but hurdles remain|last1=Finley|first1=Klint|date=2018-05-06|access-date=2 June 2019|work=Wired.com}}</ref> Individual states have been trying to pass legislation to make net neutrality a requirement within their state, overriding the FCC's decision. California has successfully passed its own [[California Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act of 2018|net neutrality act]], which the United States Department of Justice is challenging on a legal basis.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/technology/net-neutrality-california.html|title=Justice Department Sues to Stop California Net Neutrality Law|last1=Kang|first1=Cecilia|date=2018-09-30|access-date=25 June 2019|work=New York Times}}</ref>

===Canada===
[[Net neutrality in Canada]] is a debated issue in that nation, but not to the degree of partisanship in other nations such as the [[United States]] in part because of its federal regulatory structure and pre-existing supportive laws that were enacted decades before the debate arose.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/us-canada-net-neutrality-party-politics-fcc-crtc-fight-1.4447558|title=Why Canada's net neutrality fight hasn't been as fierce as the one in the U.S.|last1=Braga|first1=Matthew|date=2017-12-14|access-date=15 December 2017|publisher=CBC|agency=CBC News}}</ref> In [[Canada]], [[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) generally provide Internet service in a neutral manner. Some notable incidents otherwise have included [[Bell Canada]]'s throttling of certain protocols and [[Telus]]'s censorship of a specific website critical of the company. In the case with Bell Canada, the debate for net neutrality became a more popular topic when it was revealed that they were throttling traffic by limiting people's accessibility to view ''[[Canada's Next Great Prime Minister]]'', which eventually led to the Canadian Association of Internet Providers (CAIP) demanding the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)]] to take action on preventing the throttling of third-party traffic.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|last=Anderson|first=Steve|title=Dynamic Fair Dealing|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4426-6561-3|pages=133–143}}</ref> In October 22, 2009, the CRTC issued a ruling about internet traffic management, which favored adopting guidelines that were suggested by interest groups such as [[OpenMedia.ca]] and the Open Internet Coalition. However, the guidelines set in place require citizens to file formal complaints proving that their internet traffic is being throttled, and as a result, some ISPs still continue to throttle internet traffic of its users.<ref name=":3" />

In the year 2018, the [[Government of India|Indian Government]] unanimously approved new regulations supporting net neutrality. The regulations are considered to be the "world's strongest" net neutrality rules, guaranteeing free and open Internet for nearly half a billion people,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/12/technology/india-net-neutrality-rules-telecom/index.html|title=India now has the 'world's strongest' net neutrality rules|first=Rishi|last=Iyengar|website=cnn.com|date=2018-07-12}}</ref> and are expected to help the culture of [[Startup company|startups]] and innovation.

=== China ===
Net Neutrality in [[China]] is not enforced, and ISPs in China play important roles in regulating the content that is available domestically on the internet. There are several ISPs filtering and blocking content at the national level, preventing domestic internet users from accessing certain sites or services or foreign internet users from gaining access to domestic web content. This filtering technology is referred to as the [[Great Firewall]], or GFW.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Hu|first=Henry L.|date=2011|title=The Political Economy of Governing ISPs in China: Perspectives of Net Neutrality and Vertical Integration|journal=The China Quarterly|volume=207|issue=207|pages=523–540|doi=10.1017/S0305741011000634|jstor=41305255|issn=0305-7410}}</ref> In a journal analyzing the political climate behind net neutrality in China, Henry Hu concluded that Chinese ISPs have become a political tool for the country to heavily regulate information rather than providing neutral internet content for its users. In contrast to countries such as the United States, values such as equality and free speech are not considered in the net neutrality debate.<ref name=":1" />

Their research studied the patience level of millions of Internet video users who waited for a slow-loading video to start playing. Users who had a faster Internet connectivity, such as fiber-to-the-home, demonstrated less patience and abandoned their videos sooner than similar users with slower Internet connectivity. The results demonstrate how users can get used to faster Internet connectivity, leading to higher expectation of Internet speed, and lower tolerance for any delay that occurs. Author [[Nicholas G.

===Competition and innovation===
Net neutrality advocates argue that allowing cable companies the right to demand a toll to guarantee quality or premium delivery would create an exploitative business model based on the ISPs position as [[gatekeeper]]s.<ref name="Accel-Networks.com">{{cite web |url= http://www.accel-networks.com/blog/index.php?q=/2010/08/what-is-net-neutrality.html |title= What Is Net Neutrality? 10 Aug 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110616043917/http://www.accel-networks.com/blog/index.php?q=%2F2010%2F08%2Fwhat-is-net-neutrality.html |archive-date= 16 June 2011}}</ref> Advocates warn that by charging websites for access, network owners may be able to block competitor Web sites and services, as well as refuse access to those unable to pay.<ref name="no-tolls">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/07/AR2006060702108.html |title=No Tolls on The Internet |last=[[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Robert W.

They claim it is a preservation of the way the Internet has always operated, where the quality of websites and services determined whether they succeeded or failed, rather than deals with ISPs.<ref name="savetheinternet.com"/> [[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Robert W. McChesney]] argue that eliminating net neutrality would lead to the Internet resembling the world of cable TV, so that access to and distribution of content would be managed by a handful of massive, near monopolistic companies, though there are multiple service providers in each region. These companies would then control what is seen as well as how much it costs to see it. Speedy and secure Internet use for such industries as healthcare, finance, retailing, and gambling could be subject to large fees charged by these companies. They further explain that a majority of the great innovators in the history of the Internet started with little capital in their garages, inspired by great ideas. This was possible because the protections of net neutrality ensured limited control by owners of the networks, maximal competition in this space, and permitted innovators from outside access to the network. Internet content was guaranteed a free and highly competitive space by the existence of net neutrality.<ref name="no-tolls"/> For example, back in 2005 YouTube was just a small startup company. Due to an absence of Internet fast lanes, YouTube had the ability to grow larger than Google Video. Tom Wheeler and Senators Ronald Lee Wyden (D-Ore.) and [[Al Franken]] (D-Minn.) said, "Internet service providers treated YouTube's videos the same as they did Google's, and Google couldn't pay the ISPs [Internet service providers] to gain an unfair advantage, like a fast lane into consumers' homes," they wrote. "Well, it turned out that people liked YouTube a lot more than Google Video, so YouTube thrived."<ref name="auto1">{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/331012-what-killing-net-neutrality-means-for-the-internet|title=What killing net neutrality means for the internet|last=Breland|first=Ali|date=2017-04-28|work=TheHill|access-date=2017-11-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904230552/http://thehill.com/policy/technology/331012-what-killing-net-neutrality-means-for-the-internet|archive-date=4 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Preserving Internet standards===
Net neutrality advocates have sponsored legislation claiming that authorizing incumbent network providers to override transport and application layer separation on the Internet would signal the decline of fundamental Internet standards and international consensus authority. Further, the legislation asserts that bit-shaping the transport of application data will undermine the transport layer's designed flexibility.<ref name="dps-2.11">{{cite web |url=http://www.dpsproject.com/legislation.html |title=Internet Platform for Innovation Act |access-date=26 December 2008 |author=Dynamic Platform Standards Project |at=Sec. 2.11 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218020022/http://www.dpsproject.com/legislation.html |archive-date=18 February 2009}}</ref>

===Preventing pseudo-services===
Alok Bhardwaj, founder of [[Epic Privacy Browser]], argues that any violations to network neutrality, realistically speaking, will not involve genuine investment but rather payoffs for unnecessary and dubious services. He believes that it is unlikely that new investment will be made to lay special networks for particular websites to reach end-users faster. Rather, he believes that non-net neutrality will involve leveraging quality of service to extract remuneration from websites that want to avoid being slowed down.<ref name="scribd.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/938752/Against-FeeBased-and-other-Pernicious-Net-Prejudice-An-Explanation-and-Examination-of-the-Net-Neutrality-Debate |title=Against Fee-Based and other Pernicious Net Prejudice: An Explanation and Examination of the Net Neutrality Debate |publisher=Scribd.com |date=27 November 2007 |access-date=23 June 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116000215/http://www.scribd.com/doc/938752/Against-FeeBased-and-other-Pernicious-Net-Prejudice-An-Explanation-and-Examination-of-the-Net-Neutrality-Debate |archive-date=16 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epicbrowser.com/about_us.html|title=About Us|website=epicbrowser.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317144759/https://epicbrowser.com/about_us.html|archive-date=17 March 2015}}</ref> This theory was confirmed in 2014 when Netflix announced it was making payments to Comcast and Verizon to avoid throttling, slower Internet speeds for particular services or websites, by those ISPs. These payments were described by Netflix founder Reed Hastings as "an arbitrary tax" and "arbitrary interconnection tolls".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/71465/comcast-netflix-feud/ |title=The Hot War Between Netflix and Comcast Is Escalating |publisher=time.com |date=22 April 2014 |access-date=3 May 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522213711/http://time.com/71465/comcast-netflix-feud/ |archive-date=22 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://time.com/80192/netflix-verizon-paid-peering-agreement/ |title=Netflix Pays Verizon in Streaming Deal, Following Comcast Pact |publisher=time.com |date=14 April 2014 |access-date=3 May 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502232317/http://time.com/80192/netflix-verizon-paid-peering-agreement/ |archive-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>

===End-to-end principle===
Some advocates say network neutrality is needed in order to maintain the [[end-to-end principle]]. According to [[Lawrence Lessig]] and [[Robert W. McChesney]], all content must be treated the same and must move at the same speed in order for net neutrality to be true. They say that it is this simple but brilliant end-to-end aspect that has allowed the Internet to act as a powerful force for economic and social good.<ref name="no-tolls"/> Under this principle, a neutral network is a [[dumb network]], merely passing packets regardless of the applications they support. This point of view was expressed by David S. Isenberg in his paper, "The Rise of the Stupid Network". He states that the vision of an intelligent network is being replaced by a new network philosophy and architecture in which the network is designed for always-on use, not intermittence and scarcity. Rather than intelligence being designed into the network itself, the intelligence would be pushed out to the end-user's device; and the network would be designed simply to deliver bits without fancy network routing or smart number translation. The data would be in control, telling the network where it should be sent. End-user devices would then be allowed to behave flexibly, as bits would essentially be free and there would be no assumption that the data is of a single data rate or data type.<ref name="rageboy.com">{{cite web|author=Isenberg, David|title=The Rise of the Stupid Network|url=http://www.rageboy.com/stupidnet.html|date=1 August 1996|access-date=19 August 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820170503/http://www.rageboy.com/stupidnet.html|archive-date=20 August 2006}}</ref>

Contrary to this idea, the research paper titled "End-to-end arguments in system design" by Saltzer, Reed, and Clark<ref name="E2E">{{cite journal |author1=J. H. Saltzer |author2= D. P. Reed |author3= D.&nbsp;D.

[[Robert Pepper]], a senior managing director, global advanced technology policy, at [[Cisco Systems]], and former FCC chief of policy development, says: "The supporters of net neutrality regulation believe that more rules are necessary. In their view, without greater regulation, service providers might parcel out bandwidth or services, creating a bifurcated world in which the wealthy enjoy first-class Internet access, while everyone else is left with slow connections and degraded content. That scenario, however, is a false paradigm. Such an all-or-nothing world doesn't exist today, nor will it exist in the future. Without additional regulation, service providers are likely to continue doing what they are doing. They will continue to offer a variety of broadband service plans at a variety of price points to suit every type of consumer".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/56272.html |title=Network Neutrality: Avoiding a Net Loss |access-date=26 December 2008 |last=Pepper |first=Robert |date=14 March 2007 |website=TechNewsWorld |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011211403/http://www.technewsworld.com/story/56272.html |archive-date=11 October 2008 }}</ref> Computer scientist [[Bob Kahn]]<ref name="Robert Kahn, Forbes">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/robert-kahn/|title=Robert Kahn, Forbes|access-date=11 November 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303051602/http://www.forbes.com/profile/robert-kahn/|archive-date=3 March 2014}}</ref> has said net neutrality is a slogan that would freeze innovation in the core of the Internet.<ref name="kahn-vid"/>

===Reduction in investment===
According to a letter to FCC commissioners and key congressional leaders sent by 60 major ISP technology suppliers including IBM, Intel, Qualcomm, and Cisco, Title II regulation of the Internet "means that instead of billions of broadband investment driving other sectors of the economy forward, any reduction in this spending will stifle growth across the entire economy.

And broadband's reach is much wider in the United States, despite its much lower population density."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/fcc-internet-regulations-ajit-pai-115399.html#ixzz3TClknlL7|title=Internet Freedom Works|author1=Ajit Pai|author2=Lee Goodman|name-list-style=amp|website=POLITICO Magazine|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306043403/http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/fcc-internet-regulations-ajit-pai-115399.html#ixzz3TClknlL7|archive-date=6 March 2015}}</ref>

[[VOIP]] pioneer [[Jeff Pulver]] states that the uncertainty of the FCC imposing Title II, which experts said would create regulatory restrictions on using the Internet to transmit a voice call, was the "single greatest impediment to innovation" for a decade.<ref name=PulverForbes2014>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/12/15/title-ii-and-utility-style-regulation-is-not-how-we-should-protect-open-internet|title=Title II And Utility-Style Regulation Is Not How We Should Protect Open Internet|first=Capital|last=Flows}}</ref> According to Pulver, investors in the companies he helped found, like Vonage, held back investment because they feared the FCC could use Title II to prevent VOIP startups from bypassing telephone networks.<ref name=PulverForbes2014 />

===Significant and growing competition, investment===
A 2010 paper on net neutrality by Nobel Prize economist [[Gary Becker]] and his colleagues stated that "there is significant and growing competition among broadband access providers and that few significant competitive problems have been observed to date, suggesting that there is no compelling competitive rationale for such regulation".<ref name="faculty.chicagobooth.edu"/> Becker and fellow economists Dennis Carlton and Hal Sidler found that "Between mid-2002 and mid-2008, the number of high-speed broadband access lines in the United States grew from 16 million to nearly 133 million, and the number of residential broadband lines grew from 14 million to nearly 80 million. Internet traffic roughly tripled between 2007 and 2009. At the same time, prices for broadband Internet access services have fallen sharply."<ref name="faculty.chicagobooth.edu"/> The PPI reports that the profit margins of U.S. broadband providers are generally one-sixth to one-eighth of companies that use broadband (such as Apple or Google), contradicting the idea of monopolistic price-gouging by providers.<ref name="progressivepolicy.org"/>

When FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler redefined broadband from 4 Mbit/s to 25 Mbit/s (3.125 [[Data rate units#Megabyte per second|MB/s]]) or greater in January 2015, FCC commissioners Ajit Pai and Mike O'Reilly believed the redefinition was to set up the agency's intent to settle the net neutrality fight with new regulations. The commissioners argued that the stricter speed guidelines painted the broadband industry as less competitive, justifying the FCC's moves with Title II net neutrality regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/sorry-your-broadband-internet-technically-isnt-broadband-anymore/|title=Sorry, your broadband Internet technically isn't broadband anymore|publisher=CBS Interactive|website=CNET|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224022942/http://www.cnet.com/news/sorry-your-broadband-internet-technically-isnt-broadband-anymore/|archive-date=24 February 2015}}</ref>

A report by the [[Progressive Policy Institute]] in June 2014 argues that nearly every American can choose from at least 2-4 broadband Internet service providers, despite claims that there are only a "small number" of broadband providers.<ref name="progressivepolicy.org"/> Citing research from the FCC, the Institute wrote that 90 percent of American households have access to at least one wired and one wireless broadband provider at speeds of at least 4 [[Data rate units#Megabit per second|Mbit/s]] (500 [[Data rate units#Kilobyte per second|kbyte/s]]) downstream and 1 Mbit/s (125 kbyte/s) upstream and that nearly 88 percent of Americans can choose from at least two wired providers of broadband disregarding speed (typically choosing between a cable and telco offering). Further, three of the four national wireless companies report that they offer 4G LTE to 250–300 million Americans, with the fourth (T-Mobile) sitting at 209 million and counting.<ref name="progressivepolicy.org"/> Similarly, the FCC reported in June 2008 that 99.8% of [[ZIP code]]s in the United States had two or more providers of high speed Internet lines available, and 94.6% of ZIP codes had four or more providers, as reported by University of Chicago economists Gary Becker, Dennis Carlton, and Hal Sider in a 2010 paper.<ref name="faculty.chicagobooth.edu"/>

===Deterring competition===
FCC commissioner [[Ajit Pai]] states that the FCC completely brushes away the concerns of smaller competitors who are going to be subject to various taxes, such as state property taxes and general receipts taxes.<ref name="cnbc.com">[https://www.cnbc.com/id/102463101 "Why FCC ruling will hurt US consumers: FCC commish"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701182522/https://www.cnbc.com/id/102463101 |date=1 July 2015 }}, Fred Imbert, CNBC, 27 February 2015.</ref> As a result, according to Pai, that does nothing to create more competition within the market.<ref name="cnbc.com"/> According to Pai, the FCC's ruling to impose Title II regulations is opposed by the country's smallest private competitors and many municipal broadband providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/document/summary-commissioner-pais-oral-dissent-internet-regulation|title=Summary of Commissioner Pai's Oral Dissent on Internet Regulation|website=fcc.gov|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228175821/http://www.fcc.gov/document/summary-commissioner-pais-oral-dissent-internet-regulation|archive-date=28 February 2015|date=2015-12-10|access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref> In his dissent, Pai noted that 142 wireless ISPs (WISPs) said that FCC's new "regulatory intrusion into our businesses ... would likely force us to raise prices, delay deployment expansion, or both". He also noted that 24 of the country's smallest ISPs, each with fewer than 1,000 residential broadband customers, wrote to the FCC stating that Title II "will badly strain our limited resources" because they "have no in-house attorneys and no budget line items for outside counsel". Further, another 43 municipal broadband providers told the FCC that Title II "will trigger consequences beyond the Commission's control and risk serious harm to our ability to fund and deploy broadband without bringing any concrete benefit for consumers or edge providers that the market is not already proving today without the aid of any additional regulation".<ref name="fcc.gov"/>

According to a ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine article by TechFreedom's Berin Szoka, Matthew Starr, and Jon Henke, local governments and public utilities impose the most significant barriers to entry for more cable broadband competition: "While popular arguments focus on supposed 'monopolists' such as big cable companies, it's government that's really to blame." The authors state that local governments and their public utilities charge ISPs far more than they actually cost and have the final say on whether an ISP can build a network. The public officials determine what requirements an ISP must meet to get approval for access to publicly owned "rights of way" (which lets them place their wires), thus reducing the number of potential competitors who can profitably deploy Internet service—such as AT&T's U-Verse, Google Fiber, and Verizon FiOS. Kickbacks may include municipal requirements for ISPs such as building out service where it is not demanded, donating equipment, and delivering free broadband to government buildings.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2013/07/we-need-to-stop-focusing-on-just-cable-companies-and-blame-local-government-for-dismal-broadband-competition/ |title=Don't Blame Big Cable.

According to a research article from [[Management Information Systems Quarterly|MIS Quarterly]], the authors stated their findings subvert some of the expectations of how ISPs and CPs act regarding net neutrality laws. The paper shows that even if an ISP is under restrictions, it still has the opportunity and the incentive to act as a gatekeeper over CPs by enforcing priority delivery of content.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hong | first1 = Guo | display-authors = etal | year = 2017| title = Effects of Competition among Internet Service Providers and Content Providers on the Net Neutrality Debate | journal = MIS Quarterly | volume =  41| issue = 2 | pages =  353–370| doi = 10.25300/MISQ/2017/41.2.02 }}</ref>

===Counterweight to server-side non-neutrality===
Those in favor of forms of non-neutral tiered Internet access argue that the Internet is already not a level playing field, that large companies achieve a performance advantage over smaller competitors by providing more and better-quality servers and buying high-bandwidth services. Should scrapping of net neutrality regulations precipitate a price drop for lower levels of access, or access to only certain protocols, for instance, such would make Internet usage more adaptable to the needs of those individuals and corporations who specifically seek differentiated tiers of service. Network expert<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itif.org/people/richard-bennett|title=Former ITIF Staff|website=ITIF|access-date=6 March 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312111551/http://www.itif.org/people/richard-bennett|archive-date=12 March 2015}}</ref> Richard Bennett has written, "A richly funded Web site, which delivers data faster than its competitors to the front porches of the Internet service providers, wants it delivered the rest of the way on an equal basis.

===Potentially increased taxes===
FCC commissioner Ajit Pai, who opposed the 2015 Title II reclassification of ISPs, says that the ruling allows new fees and taxes on broadband by subjecting them to the telephone-style taxes under the Universal Service Fund. Net neutrality proponent [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]] writes,"the average potential increase in taxes and fees per household would be far less" than the estimate given by net neutrality opponents, and that if there were to be additional taxes, the tax figure may be around US$4 billion. Under favorable circumstances, "the increase would be exactly zero".<ref name="New-Internet-Tax-Claim-Skew-the-Math-and-Confuse-the-Law">{{cite web |url=http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/12/02/claims-real-net-neutrality-would-result-new-internet-tax-skew-math-and-confuse-law |title=Claims That Real Net Neutrality Would Result in New Internet Tax Skew the Math and Confuse the Law |publisher=Free Press |date=2 December 2014 |access-date=28 February 2015 |author=Wood, Matt |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301070752/http://www.freepress.net/blog/2014/12/02/claims-real-net-neutrality-would-result-new-internet-tax-skew-math-and-confuse-law |archive-date=1 March 2015}}</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Progressive Policy Institute]] claims that Title II could trigger taxes and fees up to $11 billion a year.<ref name="Politifact-Net-Neutrality-Tax-Effect-Uncertain">{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/26/mike-lee/effect-net-neutrality-rules-taxes-uncertain|title=Effect of net neutrality rules on taxes is uncertain|website=@politifact|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301162235/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/26/mike-lee/effect-net-neutrality-rules-taxes-uncertain/|archive-date=1 March 2015}}</ref> Financial website ''Nerd Wallet'' did their own assessment and settled on a possible US$6.25 billion tax impact, estimating that the average American household may see their tax bill increase US$67 annually.<ref name="Politifact-Net-Neutrality-Tax-Effect-Uncertain"/>

===Unnecessary regulations===
According to [[PayPal]] founder and [[Facebook]] investor [[Peter Thiel]] in 2011, "Net neutrality has not been necessary to date. I don't see any reason why it's suddenly become important, when the Internet has functioned quite well for the past 15 years without it. ... Government attempts to regulate technology have been extraordinarily counterproductive in the past."<ref name="nationalreview.com"/> [[Max Levchin]], the other co-founder of PayPal, echoed similar statements, telling CNBC, "The Internet is not broken, and it got here without government regulation and probably in part because of lack of government regulation."<ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/id/102457856 "Father of net neutrality: Rules won't kill spending"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701192112/https://www.cnbc.com/id/102457856 |date=1 July 2015 }}, Tom DiChristopher, CNBC, 26 February 2015.</ref>

FCC Commissioner [[Ajit Pai]], who was one of the two commissioners who opposed the net neutrality proposal, criticized the FCC's ruling on Internet neutrality, stating that the perceived threats from ISPs to deceive consumers, degrade content, or disfavor the content that they dislike are non-existent: "The evidence of these continuing threats? There is none; it's all anecdote, hypothesis, and hysteria. A small ISP in North Carolina allegedly blocked VoIP calls a decade ago. Comcast capped BitTorrent traffic to ease upload congestion eight years ago. Apple introduced Facetime over Wi-Fi first, cellular networks later. Examples this picayune and stale aren't enough to tell a coherent story about net neutrality. The bogeyman never had it so easy."<ref name="fcc.gov"/> FCC Commissioner Mike O'Reilly, the other opposing commissioner, also claims that the ruling is a solution to a hypothetical problem, "Even after enduring three weeks of spin, it is hard for me to believe that the Commission is establishing an entire Title II/net neutrality regime to protect against hypothetical harms. There is not a shred of evidence that any aspect of this structure is necessary. The D.C. Circuit called the prior, scaled-down version a 'prophylactic' approach. I call it guilt by imagination."{{cn|date=October 2020}} In a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' article, FCC Commissioner Pai and [[Joshua D. Wright|Joshua Wright]] of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] argue that "the Internet isn't broken, and we don't need the president's plan to 'fix' it. Quite the opposite.

===Inability to make Internet accessible to the poor===
Opponents argue that net neutrality regulations prevent service providers from providing more affordable Internet access to those who can't afford it.<ref name="JesseJacksonFCC2014"/> A concept known as "[[zero-rating]]", ISPs would be unable to provide Internet access for free or at a reduced cost to the poor under net neutrality rules.<ref name=KansasCityStarCanon2017>{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/technology/article151477557.html|title=Digital Life: The Trump path to free internet for the poor}}</ref><ref name="JesseJacksonFCC2014"/> For example, low-income users who can't afford bandwidth-hogging Internet services such as [[video streams]] could be exempted from paying through subsidies or advertising.<ref name="JesseJacksonFCC2014"/> However, under the rules, ISPs would not be able to discriminate traffic, thus forcing low-income users to pay for high-bandwidth usage like other users.<ref name=KansasCityStarCanon2017 />

The [[Wikimedia Foundation]], which runs [[Wikipedia]], created [[Wikipedia Zero]] to provide Wikipedia free-of-charge on mobile phones to low-income users, especially those in developing countries.

===Inability to allocate Internet traffic efficiently===
Net neutrality rules would prevent traffic from being allocated to the most needed users, according to [[List of Internet pioneers|Internet Pioneer]] [[David Farber]].<ref name=FarberKatz2007/> Because net neutrality regulations prevent a [[Data discrimination|discrimination of traffic]], networks would have to treat critical traffic equally with non-critical traffic. According to Farber, "When traffic surges beyond the ability of the network to carry it, something is going to be delayed. When choosing what gets delayed, it makes sense to allow a network to favor traffic from, say, a patient's heart monitor over traffic delivering a music download. It also makes sense to allow network operators to restrict traffic that is downright harmful, such as viruses, worms and spam."<ref name=FarberKatz2007 />

===Data discrimination===
{{Main|Data discrimination}}
[[Tim Wu]], though a proponent of network neutrality, claims that the current Internet is not neutral as its implementation of [[best effort]] generally favors [[file transfer]] and other non-time-sensitive traffic over real-time communications.<ref name="Wu Neutrality">{{cite journal|author=Wu, Tim|title=Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination|journal=Journal of Telecommunications and High Technology Law|volume=2 |page=141| year=2003 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.388863 |ssrn=388863|s2cid=19857168|url=https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2282&context=faculty_scholarship}}</ref> Generally, a network which blocks some [[Node (networking)|nodes]] or services for the customers of the network would normally be expected to be less useful to the customers than one that did not. Therefore, for a network to remain significantly non-neutral requires either that the customers not be concerned about the particular non-neutralities or the customers not have any meaningful choice of providers, otherwise they would presumably switch to another provider with fewer restrictions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

While the network neutrality debate continues, network providers often enter into peering arrangements among themselves. These agreements often stipulate how certain information flows should be treated. In addition, network providers often implement various policies such as blocking of port 25 to prevent insecure systems from serving as spam relays, or other ports commonly used by decentralized music search applications implementing peer-to-peer networking models. They also present terms of service that often include rules about the use of certain applications as part of their contracts with users.{{Citation needed |date=December 2008}} Most consumer Internet providers implement policies like these. The MIT Mantid Port Blocking Measurement Project is a measurement effort to characterize Internet port blocking and potentially discriminatory practices. However, the effect of peering arrangements among network providers are only local to the peers that enter into the arrangements and cannot affect traffic flow outside their scope.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

[[Jon Peha]] from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] believes it is important to create policies that protect users from harmful traffic discrimination while allowing beneficial discrimination.

Other applications need broadband streaming capability in order to deliver real-time video. Others don't really care as long as they can get the bits there, like e-mail or file transfers and things like that.

===Content caching===
[[Cache (computing)|Content caching]] is the process by which frequently accessed contents are temporarily stored in strategic network positions (e.g., in servers close to the end-users<ref name="edgecaching_NN">{{cite web |last1=Marcus |first1=Adam |title=Nuts and Bolts: Network neutrality and edge caching |url=http://blog.pff.org/archives/2008/12/edge_caching.html |website=The Progress & Freedom Foundation |access-date=12 June 2018}}</ref>) to achieve several performance objectives. For example, caching is commonly used by ISPs to reduce [[network congestion]] and results in a superior [[quality of experience]] (QoE) perceived by the final users.

Since the storage available in cache servers is limited, caching involves a process of selection of the contents worth storing. Several [[cache algorithm]]s have been designed to perform this process which, in general, leads to store the most popular contents. The cached contents are retrieved at a higher QoE (e.g., lower latency) and caching can be therefore considered a form of traffic differentiation.<ref name="NN_benefits_risks" /> However, caching is not generally viewed as a form of discriminatory traffic differentiation. For example, the technical writer Adam Marcus states that "accessing content from edge servers may be a bit faster for users, but nobody is being discriminated against and most content on the Internet is not latency-sensitive".<ref name="edgecaching_NN" /> In line with this statement, caching is not regulated by legal frameworks that are favourable to Net Neutrality, such as the Open Internet Order issued by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] in 2015. Even more so, the legitimacy of caching has never been put in doubt by opponents of Net Neutrality. On the contrary, the complexity of caching operations (e.g., extensive information processing) has been successively regarded by the FCC as one of the technical reasons why ISPs should not be considered common carriers, which legitimates the abrogation of Net Neutrality rules.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Federal Communications Commission |title=Restoring Internet Freedom - DECLARATORY RULING, REPORT AND ORDER, AND ORDER |url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-347927A1.pdf |access-date=13 June 2018}}</ref> Under a Net Neutrality regime, prioritization of a class of traffic with respect to another one is allowed only if several requirements are met (e.g., objectively different QoS requirements).<ref>{{cite web |last1=BEREC |title=What is traffic management and what is 'equal treatment'? |url=https://berec.europa.eu/eng/netneutrality/traffic_management/}}</ref> However, when it comes to caching, a selection of contents of the same class has to be performed (e.g., set of videos worth storing in cache servers). In the spirit of a general deregulation with regard to caching, there is not a rule that specifies how this process can be carried out in a non-discriminatory way. Nevertheless, the scientific literature considers the issue of caching as a potentially discriminatory process and provides possible guidelines to address it.<ref name="NN_2010s">{{cite journal |last1=Maillé |first1=Patrick |title=Toward a Net Neutrality Debate that Conforms to the 2010s |journal=IEEE Communications Magazine |date=2016 |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=94–99 |doi=10.1109/MCOM.2016.7432154 |s2cid=3216065 |url=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01127958/file/paper.pdf }}</ref> For example, a non-discriminatory caching might be performed considering the popularity of contents, or with the aim of guaranteeing the same QoE to all the users, or, alternatively, to achieve some common welfare objectives.<ref name="NN_2010s" />

As far as [[Content Delivery Network|CDNs]] are concerned, the relation between caching and Net Neutrality is even more complex. In fact, CDNs are employed to allow a scalable and highly-efficient content delivery rather than to grant access to the Internet. Consequently, differently from ISPs, CDNs are entitled to charge content providers for caching their contents. Therefore, although this may be regarded as a form of paid traffic prioritization, CDNs are not subject of Net Neutrality regulations and are rarely included in the debate. Despite of this, it is argued by some that the Internet ecosystem has changed to such an extent that all the players involved in the content delivery can distort competition and should be therefore also included in the discussion around Net Neutrality.<ref name="NN_2010s" /> Among those, the analyst Dan Rayburn suggested that "the Open Internet Order enacted by the FCC in 2015 was myopically focussed on ISPs".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baksh |first1=Mariam |title=Content Delivery Networks Complicate Debate Over Net Neutrality |url=https://morningconsult.com/2017/07/28/content-delivery-networks-complicate-debate-net-neutrality/ |access-date=14 June 2018|date=2017-07-28 }}</ref>

===Quality of service===
{{Main|Quality of service}}
Internet routers forward packets according to the diverse peering and transport agreements that exist between network operators. Many networks using Internet protocols now employ quality of service (QoS), and Network Service Providers frequently enter into Service Level Agreements with each other embracing some sort of QoS. There is no single, uniform method of interconnecting networks using [[Internet Protocol|IP]], and not all networks that use IP are part of the Internet. [[IPTV]] networks are isolated from the Internet and are therefore not covered by network neutrality agreements. The IP [[datagram]] includes a 3-bit wide Precedence field and a larger [[Differentiated services|DiffServ]] Code Point (DSCP) that are used to request a level of service, consistent with the notion that protocols in a layered architecture offer services through [[Service Access Point]]s. This field is sometimes ignored, especially if it requests a level of service outside the originating network's contract with the receiving network. It is commonly used in private networks, especially those including [[Wi-Fi]] networks where priority is enforced. While there are several ways of communicating service levels across Internet connections, such as [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]], [[Resource Reservation Protocol|RSVP]], [[IEEE 802.11e]], and [[Multiprotocol Label Switching|MPLS]], the most common scheme combines SIP and DSCP. Router manufacturers now sell routers that have logic enabling them to route traffic for various Classes of Service at "wire-speed".

Quality of service is sometimes taken as a measurement through certain tools to test a user's connection quality, such as Network Diagnostic Tools (NDT) and services on speedtest.net. These tools are known to be used by [[Regulatory agency|National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs)]], who use these QoS measurements as a way of detecting Net Neutrality violations. However, there are very few examples of such measurements being used in any significant way by NRAs, or in network policy for that matter. Often, these tools are used not because they fail at recording the results they are meant to record, but because said measurements are inflexible and difficult to exploit for any significant purpose. According to Ioannis Koukoutsidis, the problems with the current tools used to measure QoS stem from a lack of a standard detection methodology, a need to be able to detect various methods in which an ISP might violate Net Neutrality, and the inability to test an average measurement for a specific population of users.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koukoutsidis|first=Ioannis|date=2015|title=Public QoS and Net Neutrality Measurements: Current Status and Challenges Toward Exploitable Results|jstor=10.5325/jinfopoli.5.2015.0245|journal=Journal of Information Policy|volume=5|pages=245–286|doi=10.5325/jinfopoli.5.2015.0245|doi-access=free}}</ref>

With the emergence of multimedia, [[VoIP]], IPTV, and other applications that benefit from low latency, various attempts to address the inability of some private networks to limit latency have arisen, including the proposition of offering [[tiered service]] levels that would shape Internet transmissions at the network layer based on application type. These efforts are ongoing, and are starting to yield results as wholesale Internet transport providers begin to amend service agreements to include service levels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=101271 |title=Carriers Seek IP QOS Peers |access-date=26 December 2008 |last=Sullivan |first=Mark |date=14 August 2006 |publisher=Light Reading |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141744/http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=101271 |archive-date=16 December 2008}}</ref>

Advocates of net neutrality have proposed several methods to implement a net neutral Internet that includes a notion of quality-of-service:
* An approach offered by Tim Berners-Lee allows discrimination between different tiers, while enforcing strict neutrality of data sent at each tier: "If I pay to connect to the Net with a given quality of service, and you pay to connect to the net with the same or higher quality of service, then you and I can communicate across the net, with that quality and quantity of service."<ref name="berners-lee-def" /> "[We] each pay to connect to the Net, but no one can pay for exclusive access to me."<ref name="berners-lee-def1">{{cite web |url=http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/132 |title=Neutrality of the Net |access-date=26 December 2008 |last=Berners-Lee |first=Tim |author-link=Tim Berners-Lee |date=2 May 2006 |website=timbl's blog |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101023106/http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/132 |archive-date=1 January 2009}}</ref>
* United States lawmakers have introduced bills that would now allow quality of service discrimination for certain services as long as no special fee is charged for higher-quality service.<ref name="S215">''A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure net neutrality'', {{USBill|110|S|215}}</ref>

Founder of [[Epic (web browser)|Epic Privacy Browser]], Alok Bhardwaj, has argued that net neutrality preservation through legislation is consistent with implementing quality of service protocols. He argues legislation should ban the charging of fees for any quality of service, which would both allow networks to implement quality of service as well as remove any incentive to abuse net neutrality ideas. He argues that since implementing quality of service does not require any additional costs versus a non-QoS network, there is no reason implementing quality of service should entail any additional fees.<ref name="scribd.com"/> However, the core network hardware needed (with large number of queues, etc.) and the cost of designing and maintaining a QoS network are both much higher than for a non-QoS network.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Wireless networks===
There are also some discrepancies in how wireless networks affect the implementation of net neutrality policy, some of which are noted in the studies of [[Christopher Yoo]]. In one research article, he claimed that "...bad handoffs, local congestion, and the physics of [[wave propagation]] make wireless broadband networks significantly less reliable than fixed broadband networks."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yoo|first=Christopher S.|title=Wireless Network Neutrality: Technological Challenges and Policy Implications|journal=Berkeley Technology Law Journal|volume=31|issue=2|date=January 2017|pages=1409–1458|jstor=26381956}}</ref>

===Pricing models===
Broadband Internet access has most often been sold to users based on [[Excess Information Rate]] or maximum available bandwidth. If [[Internet service providers]] (ISPs) can provide varying levels of service to websites at various prices, this may be a way to manage the costs of unused capacity by selling surplus bandwidth (or "leverage [[price discrimination]] to recoup costs of '[[consumer surplus]]{{'"}}). However, purchasers of connectivity on the basis of [[Committed Information Rate]] or guaranteed bandwidth capacity must expect the capacity they purchase in order to meet their communications requirements. Various studies have sought to provide network providers the necessary formulas for adequately pricing such a [[tiered service]] for their customer base. But while network neutrality is primarily focused on protocol based provisioning, most of the pricing models are based on bandwidth restrictions.<ref name="pricingstudy">{{cite web |url=http://rouskas.csc.ncsu.edu/Publications/Thesis/PHD-Lv-2010.pdf |title=NCSU.edu |access-date=23 June 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720011813/http://rouskas.csc.ncsu.edu/Publications/Thesis/PHD-Lv-2010.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2011}}</ref>

Many Economists have analyzed Net Neutrality to compare various hypothetical pricing models.  For instance, economic professors Michael L. Katz and Benjamin E. Hermalin at the University of California Berkeley co-published paper titled, "The Economics of Product-Line Restrictions with an Application to the Network Neutrality Debate" in 2007. In this paper they compared the single service economic equilibrium to the multi-service economic equilibriums under Net Neutrality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi, Jeon, Kim|first=Jay Pil, Doh-Shin, Byung|date=August 2015|title=Net, Neutrality, Business Models, and Internet Interconnection|journal=American Economic Association|volume=7|issue=3|pages=108|jstor=24467004}}</ref>

===Reactions to removing net neutrality in the US===
On 12 July 2017, an event called the [[Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality|Day of Action]] was held to advocate [[net neutrality in the United States]] in response to Ajit Pai's plans to remove government policies that upheld net neutrality. Several websites participated in this event, including ones such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Netflix]], [[Google]], and several other just as well-known websites. The gathering was called "the largest online protest in history."&nbsp;Websites chose many different ways to convey their message. The founder of [[world-wide web|the web]], [[Tim Berners-Lee]], published a video defending FCC's rules. [[Reddit]] made a pop-up message that loads slowly to illustrate the effect of removing net neutrality. Other websites also put up some less obvious notifications, such as Amazon, who put up a hard-to-notice link, or Google, who put up policy blog post as opposed to a more obvious message.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15958030/net-neutrality-day-of-action-internet-companies-list|title=Here's how the internet's net neutrality day of action unfolded|last=Lecher|first=Colin|date=12 July 2017|website=The Verge|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107021826/https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/12/15958030/net-neutrality-day-of-action-internet-companies-list|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=live|access-date=3 November 2017}}</ref>

A poll conducted by [[Mozilla]] showed strong support for net neutrality across [[US political parties]]. Out of the approximately 1,000 responses received by the poll, 76% of Americans, 81% of Democrats, and 73% of Republicans, support net neutrality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/06/06/new-mozilla-poll-americans-political-parties-overwhelmingly-support-net-neutrality/|title=New Mozilla Poll: Americans from Both Political Parties Overwhelmingly Support Net Neutrality|last=Mozilla|date=6 June 2017|website=Mozilla|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107020559/https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/06/06/new-mozilla-poll-americans-political-parties-overwhelmingly-support-net-neutrality/|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=live|access-date=3 November 2017}}</ref> The poll also showed that 78% of Americans do not think that Trump's government can be trusted to protect access to the Internet. Net neutrality supporters had also made several comments on the FCC website opposing plans to remove net neutrality, especially after [[Net Neutrality (Last Week Tonight)#"Net Neutrality II"|a segment]] by [[John Oliver]] regarding this topic was aired on his show ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver|Last Week Tonight]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/05/most-fcc-commenters-favor-net-neutrality-but-you-wouldnt-know-it-from-ajit-pai/|title=Flooded with thoughtful net neutrality comments, FCC highlights "mean tweets"|last=Brodkin|first=Jon|date=16 May 2017|website=Ars Technica|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107022204/https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/05/most-fcc-commenters-favor-net-neutrality-but-you-wouldnt-know-it-from-ajit-pai/|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=live|access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref> He urged his viewers to comment on the FCC's website, and the flood of comments that were received crashed the FCC's website, with the resulting media coverage of the incident inadvertently helping it to reach greater audiences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak|title=Net Neutrality II: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO)|last=LastWeekTonight|date=2017-05-07|website=YouTube|access-date=2018-05-28}}</ref> However, in response, Ajit Pai selected one particular comment that specifically supported removal of net neutrality policies.

At the end of August, the FCC released more than 13,000 pages of net neutrality complaints filed by [[consumers]], yet it was released one day before the deadline for the public to comment on Ajit Pai's proposal to remove net neutrality. It has been implied that the FCC ignored evidence against their proposal in order to remove the protection laws faster. It has also been noted that nowhere was it mentioned how FCC made any attempt to resolve the complaints made. Regardless, Ajit Pai's proposal has drawn more than 22 million comments, though a large amount were spam. However, there were 1.5 million personalized comments, 98.5% of them protesting Ajit Pai's plan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/fcc-makes-net-neutrality-complaints-public-but-too-late-to-stop-repeal/|title=FCC makes net neutrality complaints public, but too late to stop repeal|last=Brodin|first=Jon|date=5 September 2017|website=Ars Technica|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107022032/https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/fcc-makes-net-neutrality-complaints-public-but-too-late-to-stop-repeal/|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=live|access-date=3 November 2017}}</ref>&nbsp;

{{As of|2018|1}},{{Update after|2018|5}} Fifty senators endorsed a legislative measure to override the Federal Communications Commission's decision to deregulate the broadband industry. [[Congressional Review Act|The Congressional Review Act]] paperwork was filed on 9 May 2018, which allowed the [[United States Senate|Senate]] to vote on the permanence of the new net neutrality rules proposed by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/16/net-neutrality-is-getting-a-big-vote-in-the-senate-today-heres-what-to-expect/?noredirect=on|title=Senate approves bipartisan resolution to restore FCC net neutrality rules|last=Fung|first=Brian|date=2018-05-16|website=The Washington Post|access-date=2018-05-28}}</ref> The vote passed and a resolution was approved to try and remove the FCC's new rules on net neutrality; however, officials doubt there is enough time to completely repeal the rules before the [[FCC Open Internet Order 2010|Open Internet Order]] officially expired on 11 June 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/net-neutrality-will-officially-die-on-june-11/|title=Net neutrality will officially die on 11 June|last=Coldewey|first=Devin|date=2018-05-10|website=Tech Crunch|access-date=2018-05-28}}</ref> A September 2018 report from Northeastern University and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst found that U.S. telecom companies are indeed slowing Internet traffic to and from those two sites in particular along with other popular apps.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kharif |first=Olga |date=4 September 2018 |title=YouTube, Netflix Videos Found to Be Slowed by Wireless Carriers|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/youtube-and-netflix-throttled-by-carriers-research-finds|work=Bloomberg |access-date=11 September 2018 }}</ref> In March 2019, congressional supporters of net neutrality introduced the Save the Internet Act in both the House and Senate, which if passed would reverse the FCC's 2017 repeal of net neutrality protections.<ref>{{cite news |last= Greer|first=Evan|date=6 March 2019|title=Trump killed net neutrality.

=== Rural digital divide ===
A [[digital divide]] is referred to as the difference between those who have access to internet and those using digital technologies based on urban against rural areas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Connolly|first1=Michelle|last2=Lee|first2=Clement|last3=Tan|first3=Renhao|date=June 2017|title=The Digital Divide and Other Economic Considerations for Network Neutrality|journal=Review of Industrial Organization|language=en|volume=50|issue=4|pages=537–554|doi=10.1007/s11151-016-9554-8|s2cid=157582298|issn=0889-938X}}</ref> In the U.S, government city tech leaders warned in 2017 that the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality will widen the digital divide, negatively affect small businesses, and job opportunities for middle class and low-income citizens.
