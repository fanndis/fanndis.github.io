Raised a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], Springsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima Catholic school in Freehold, where he was at odds with the nuns and rebelled against the strictures imposed upon him, even though some of his later music reflects a Catholic ethos and includes a few rock-influenced, traditional [[Irish-Catholic]] hymns.<ref name="glorydays">''Glory Days: Bruce Springsteen in the 1980s.'' Dave Marsh, 1987, pg. 88–89.</ref> In a 2012 interview, he explained that it was his Catholic upbringing rather than political ideology that most influenced his music. He remarked that his faith had given him a "very active spiritual life" but joked that this "made it very difficult sexually". He added, "Once a Catholic, always a Catholic."<ref name="RS" /><ref>Editors, "Boss Talk," ''The Tablet,'' February 25, 2012.</ref> He grew up hearing fellow New Jersey singer [[Frank Sinatra]] on the radio and became interested in being a musician himself when, in 1956 and 1957, at the age of seven, he saw [[Elvis Presley]] on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Soon after, his mother rented him a guitar from Mike Diehl's Music in Freehold for $6 a week, but it failed to provide him with the instant gratification he desired.<ref>Springsteen: Saint In The City: 1949–1974 by Craig Statham. Soundcheck Books, 2013, pp8-9. {{ISBN|978-0957144231}}.</ref>

In ninth grade, Springsteen began attending the public [[Freehold High School]], but did not fit in there either. Former teachers have said he was a "loner who wanted nothing more than to play his guitar". He graduated in 1967, but felt so alienated that he skipped the ceremony.<ref>''Springsteen''. Robert Hilburn, 1985, p. 28.</ref> He briefly attended [[Ocean County College]], but dropped out.<ref name="glorydays" /> Called for [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] when he was 19, Springsteen failed the physical examination and avoided service in the [[Vietnam War]].

In 1964, Springsteen saw the [[Beatles]]' appearances on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''.

In late 1964, Springsteen's mother took out a loan to buy him a $60 Kent guitar. Springsteen later memorialized this act in his song "The Wish". The following year, he went to the house of Tex and Marion Vinyard, who sponsored young bands in town. They helped him become the lead guitarist and subsequently one of the lead singers of the Castiles. The Castiles recorded two original songs at a public recording studio in [[Brick Township, New Jersey|Brick Township]] and played a variety of venues, including [[Cafe Wha?]] in [[Greenwich Village]]. Marion Vinyard said that she believed the young Springsteen when he promised he would make it big.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Springsteen: Saint In The City: 1949–1974|last=Statham|first=Craig|publisher=Soundcheck Books|year=2013|isbn=978-0957144231}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newstranscript.gmnews.com/news/2002/0417/Front_page/003.html |title=Musicians' best friends to be honored in Freehold |work=News Transcript |location=New Jersey |date=April 17, 2002 |accessdate=June 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223191210/http://newstranscript.gmnews.com/news/2002/0417/Front_page/003.html |archive-date=February 23, 2009 }}</ref>

In the late 1960s, Springsteen performed briefly in a [[power trio]] known as Earth, playing in clubs in New Jersey, with one major show at the Hotel Diplomat in [[New York City]].<ref name=":1" /> 

From 1969 through early 1971, Springsteen performed with [[Steel Mill]] (originally called Child), which included [[Danny Federici]], [[Vini Lopez]], [[Vinnie Roslin]], and later [[Steve Van Zandt]] and [[Robbin Thompson]]. During this time, he performed regularly at venues on the [[Jersey Shore]], in [[Richmond, Virginia]],<ref>{{Cite news |title=The Boss Growing Up in Richmond |url=http://dig.library.vcu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/com/id/7779/rec/36 |work=[[The Commonwealth Times]] |date=April 29, 1986 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112138/http://dig.library.vcu.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/com/id/7779/rec/36 |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |access-date=January 13, 2019 }}</ref> [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and a set of gigs in [[California]],<ref name=":1" /> quickly gathering a cult following.

Over the next two years, as Springsteen sought to shape a unique and genuine musical and lyrical style, he performed with ''Dr. Zoom & the Sonic Boom'' (early- to mid-1971), the ''Sundance Blues Band'' (mid-1971), and the ''Bruce Springsteen Band'' (mid-1971 to mid-1972).<ref>Santelli, R. ''Greetings from E Street'' (book)</ref>

Springsteen's prolific songwriting ability (with "more words in some individual songs than other artists had in whole albums", as his future record label would describe it in early publicity campaigns) brought his skills to the attention of several people who were about to change his life: New managers [[Mike Appel]] and Jim Cretecos, who in turn brought him to the attention of [[Columbia Records]] talent scout [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]]. Hammond auditioned Springsteen in May 1972.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/bruce-springsteen-auditioned-for-columbia-records-40-years-ago-this-month/|title=Revisiting Bruce Springsteen's Columbia Records Audition|first=Dave|last=Lifton|website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref>

In October 1972, Springsteen formed a new band for the recording of his debut album, ''[[Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.]]'' The band eventually became known as the E Street Band, although the name was not used until September 1974.<ref name="rs-esb">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/25556603/the_band_on_bruce_their_springsteen/print|title=The Band on Bruce: Their Springsteen|last=Fricke |first= David| work= Rolling Stone|date=January 21, 2009|accessdate=February 7, 2009|author-link=David Fricke| archive-url= https://archive.today/20090125013657/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/25556603/the_band_on_bruce_their_springsteen/print|archive-date=January 25, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brucespringsteen.it/e_streetx.htm |title=Bruce Springsteen Bands: from Rogues to E Street Band, passing from Castiles and Steel Mill |publisher=brucespringsteen.it |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193948/http://www.brucespringsteen.it/e_streetx.htm |archive-date=March 3, 2016 }}</ref> Springsteen acquired the nickname "The Boss" during this period, as he took on the task of collecting his band's nightly pay and distributing it amongst his bandmates.<ref name=bbc-nicknames>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7829013.stm |title=What's in a nickname? |last=Brett |first=Oliver |work=BBC News |accessdate=January 21, 2009 |date=January 15, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118223753/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7829013.stm |archive-date=January 18, 2009 }}</ref> The nickname also reportedly sprang from games of [[Monopoly (board game)|Monopoly]] that Springsteen would play with other Jersey Shore musicians.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Marchand |first1=Francois |title=Review: Bruce Springsteen rocks like a boss in Vancouver |url=https://vancouversun.com/entertainment/Review+Bruce+Springsteen+rocks+like+boss+Vancouver/7612975/story.html |accessdate=September 7, 2014 |work=Vancouver Sun |date=November 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830170940/http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/Review%20Bruce%20Springsteen%20rocks%20like%20boss%20Vancouver/7612975/story.html |archive-date=August 30, 2017 }}</ref>

===1972–1974: Initial struggle for success===
Springsteen was signed to Columbia Records in 1972 by [[Clive Davis]], after having initially piqued the interest of John Hammond, who had signed [[Bob Dylan]] to the same label a decade earlier. Despite the expectations of Columbia Records' executives that Springsteen would record an acoustic album, he brought many of his New Jersey-based colleagues into the studio with him, thus forming the E Street Band (although it would not be formally named for several months).

Because of Springsteen's lyrical poeticism and [[folk rock]]-rooted music exemplified on tracks like "[[Blinded by the Light]]"<ref group=note>"Blinded by the Light" would later be a hit for [[Manfred Mann]] and reach No. 1, the only time Springsteen had a No. 1 single as a songwriter.</ref> and "[[For You (Bruce Springsteen song)|For You]]", as well as the Columbia and Hammond connections, critics initially compared Springsteen to Bob Dylan. "He sings with a freshness and urgency I haven't heard since I was rocked by '[[Like a Rolling Stone]]'" wrote ''[[Crawdaddy (magazine)|Crawdaddy]]'' magazine editor [[Peter Knobler]] in Springsteen's first interview/profile in March 1973.

In September 1973, Springsteen's second album, ''[[The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle]]'', was released, again to critical acclaim but no commercial success. Springsteen's songs became grander in form and scope, with the E Street Band providing a less folksy, more R&B vibe, and the lyrics often romanticized teenage street life. "[[4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)]]" and "Incident on 57th Street" would become fan favorites, and the long, rousing "[[Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)]]" continues to rank among Springsteen's most beloved concert numbers.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

After seeing a performance at the Harvard Square Theater, music critic [[Jon Landau]] wrote the following in the May 22, 1974, issue of Boston's ''[[The Real Paper]]'': "I saw rock and roll future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very first time."<ref>{{cite news|last=Landau |first=Jon |date=May 22, 1974 |url=https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,20057685_20057687_20152218,00.html |title=Growing Young With Rock and Roll |work=[[The Real Paper]] |accessdate=March 21, 2010 |author-link=Jon Landau |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116052323/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C20057685_20057687_20152218%2C00.html |archive-date=January 16, 2010 }}</ref> Landau helped to finish the epic new album ''[[Born to Run]]'' and subsequently became Springsteen's [[Talent manager|manager]] and producer. Given an enormous budget in a last-ditch effort at a commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for a "[[Wall of Sound]]" production. But when his manager, [[Mike Appel]], orchestrated the release of an early mix of "[[Born to Run (Bruce Springsteen song)|Born to Run]]" to nearly a dozen radio stations, anticipation built toward the album's release.<ref name="masur">{{cite book|last1=Masur|first1=Louis P.|title=Runaway Dream: Born to Run and Bruce Springsteen's American Vision|url=https://archive.org/details/runawaydreamborn00masu|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/runawaydreamborn00masu/page/48 48]|quote=1975 born to run anticipation.|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|accessdate=November 8, 2016|language=en|date=August 31, 2010|isbn=9781608191017}}</ref>

The album took more than 14 months to record, with six months spent on the song "Born to Run". During this time, Springsteen battled with anger and frustration over the album, saying he heard "sounds in [his] head" that he could not explain to the others in the studio. It was during a recording session of "[[Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out]]", on July 13, 1975, that [[Steve Van Zandt]] was asked by Springsteen and [[Jon Landau]] to take charge and instruct the horn players. They both knew he was playing guitar and managing [[Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes]], who had the sound they were looking for. Van Zandt "sang each horn player his part, with the lines, the timing and the inflection all perfect. The musicians played their parts, and the horns were recorded. When they'd finished, Springsteen turned to [[Mike Appel]]. "Okay," he said. "It's time to put the boy on the payroll.

The album was completed on July 25, but at the end of the grueling recording sessions Springsteen was not satisfied, and upon first hearing the finished album, threw it into the alley; another master was so bad that Bruce flung it out of his hotel room window and into a river. He was going to scrap half of it, he told Appel, and substitute live recordings from upcoming dates at [[The Bottom Line (venue)|The Bottom Line]] in New York (a place he often played).<ref>{{cite book| author-link= Dave Marsh |last= Marsh |first= Dave |title=Bruce Springsteen: Two Hearts: The Definitive Biography, 1972–2003 |publisher= Routledge |year= 2003 |pages= 14, 203, etc.|isbn= 0-415-96928-X}}</ref>

===1975–1983: Breakthrough===
On August 13, 1975, Springsteen and the E Street Band began a five-night, 10-show stand at New York's The Bottom Line club. This attracted major media attention and was broadcast live on [[WNEW-FM]]. Decades later, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine would name the stand as one of the 50 Moments That Changed Rock and Roll.<ref>{{cite web |date= June 24, 2004| url= https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6085455/the_moments/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204181514/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6085455/the_moments/|archive-date= December 4, 2007|title=The Moments|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

''[[Born to Run]]'' was released on August 25, 1975.

[[File:Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band 1977.jpg|thumb|Springsteen and the E Street Band, 1977]]
A legal battle with former manager [[Mike Appel]] kept Springsteen out of the studio for nearly a year, during which time he kept the E Street Band together through [[Born to Run tours|extensive touring across the U.S.]] Despite the optimistic fervor with which he often performed, Springsteen's new songs sounded more somber than much of his previous work. Reaching settlement with Appel in 1977, Springsteen returned to the studio, and the subsequent sessions produced ''[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]'' (1978). Musically, this album was a turning point in Springsteen's career. Gone were the raw, rapid-fire lyrics, outsized characters, and long, multi-part musical compositions of the first three albums; the songs were leaner and more carefully drawn and began to reflect Springsteen's growing intellectual and political awareness. The cross-country [[Darkness Tour|1978 tour]] to promote the album would become legendary for the intensity and length of its shows.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2005/05/faux_americana.single.html |title=Faux Americana, Why I still love Bruce Springsteen. |last=Metcalf |first=Stephen |date=May 2, 2005 |work=Slate |accessdate=October 30, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101210213/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2005/05/faux_americana.single.html |archive-date=November 1, 2013 }}</ref>

By the late 1970s, Springsteen had earned a reputation in the pop world as a songwriter whose material could provide hits for other bands. [[Manfred Mann's Earth Band]] had achieved a US No. 1 pop hit with a heavily rearranged version of ''Greetings''{{'}} "Blinded by the Light" in early 1977. [[Patti Smith]] reached No. 13 with her take on Springsteen's unreleased "[[Because the Night]]" (with revised lyrics by Smith) in 1978, while [[The Pointer Sisters]] hit No. 2 in 1979 with Springsteen's also unreleased "[[Fire (Bruce Springsteen song)|Fire]]". Between 1976 and 1978, Springsteen provided four compositions to [[Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes]], including "[[The Fever (Bruce Springsteen song)|The Fever]]" and "Hearts of Stone", and collaborated on four more with [[Steven Van Zandt]], producer of their first three albums.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlin |first1=Peter |title=Bruce |date=2012 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |url= https://www.simonandschuster.com/ |location=New York |accessdate=August 20, 2019}}</ref>

In September 1979, Springsteen and the E Street Band joined the [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti-nuclear power]] collective at [[Madison Square Garden]] for two nights, playing an abbreviated set while premiering two songs from his upcoming album. The subsequent ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'' live album, as well as the following summer's ''[[No Nukes (film)|No Nukes]]'' documentary film, represented the first official recordings and footage of Springsteen's fabled live act, as well as Springsteen's first tentative dip into political involvement.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Springsteen continued to focus on working-class life with the 20-song double album ''[[The River (Bruce Springsteen album)|The River]]'' in 1980, which included an intentionally paradoxical range of material from good-time party rockers to emotionally intense ballads, and finally yielded his first hit Top Ten single as a performer, "[[Hungry Heart]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/12/18/bruce-springsteen-hungry-heart-ramones/|title=Bruce Springsteen reveals he wrote 'Hungry Heart' for the Ramones|website=EW.com}}</ref> The album sold well, becoming his first No. 1 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/502085/bruce-springsteen-squeaks-by-adele-earns-tenth-no-1-album|title=Bruce Springsteen Squeaks By Adele, Earns Tenth No. 1 Album|website=Billboard|access-date=October 23, 2019}}</ref>

''The River'' was followed in 1982 by the stark solo [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic]] ''[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]''. According to the [[Dave Marsh|Marsh]] biographies, Springsteen was depressed when he wrote this material, and the result is a brutal depiction of American life. While ''Nebraska'' did not sell as well as Springsteen's three previous albums, it garnered widespread critical praise (including being named "Album of the Year" by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's critics) and influenced later works by other major artists, including [[U2]]'s album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

===1984–1991: Commercial and popular phenomenon===
Springsteen is probably best known for his album ''[[Born in the U.S.A.]]'' (1984), which sold 15&nbsp;million copies in the U.S., 30&nbsp;million worldwide, and became one of the best-selling albums of all time with seven singles hitting the Top 10. <!--[save for tour article] The band played Europe for the third time, starting in Slane Castle, Dublin, Ireland, before 80,000 fans and concluding before 113,000 fans at Leeds' Roundhay Park. --> The [[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|title track]] was a bitter commentary on the treatment of [[Vietnam veteran]]s, some of whom were Springsteen's friends. The lyrics in the verses were entirely unambiguous when listened to, but the anthemic music and the title of the song made it hard for many, from politicians to the common person, to get the lyrics—except those in the chorus, which could be read many ways.<ref>Guterman, Jimmy. ''Runaway American Dream'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: Da Capo Press, 2005. 153.</ref> The song made a huge political impact, as he was advocating for the rights of the common working-class man.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|title=How Ronald Reagan Changed Bruce Springsteen's Politics |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/bruce-springsteen-ronald-reagan-107448 |website=[[Politico]] |accessdate=December 14, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220020008/http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/bruce-springsteen-ronald-reagan-107448 |archive-date=December 20, 2015 }}</ref>

The song was widely misinterpreted as [[jingoism|jingoistic]], and in connection with the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 presidential campaign]] became the [[Born in the U.S.A. (song)#Political reactions|subject of considerable folklore]]. In 1984, conservative columnist [[George Will]] attended a Springsteen concert and then wrote a column praising Springsteen's work ethic. Six days after the column was printed, in a campaign rally in [[Hammonton, New Jersey]], Reagan said, "America's future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in the songs of a man so many young Americans admire—New Jersey's own, Bruce Springsteen." Two nights later, at a concert in Pittsburgh, Springsteen told the crowd, "Well, [[Ronald Reagan|the president]] was mentioning my name in his speech the other day and I kind of got to wondering what his favorite album of mine must've been, you know? I don't think it was the ''Nebraska'' album. I don't think he's been listening to this one." He then began playing "Johnny 99", with its allusions to closing factories and criminals.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dolan |first1=Marc |title=How Ronald Reagan Changed Bruce Springsteen's Politics |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/bruce-springsteen-ronald-reagan-107448.html |accessdate=July 28, 2014 |work=Politico |date=April 6, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809012611/http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/06/bruce-springsteen-ronald-reagan-107448.html |archive-date=August 9, 2014 }}</ref>

"[[Dancing in the Dark (Bruce Springsteen song)|Dancing in the Dark]]" was the biggest of seven hit singles from ''Born in the U.S.A.'', peaking at No. 2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' singles chart. The video for the song showed a young [[Courteney Cox]] dancing on stage with Springsteen, which helped start the actress's career. The song "[[Cover Me (Bruce Springsteen song)|Cover Me]]" was written by Springsteen for [[Donna Summer]], but his record company persuaded him to keep it for the new album. A big fan of Summer's work, Springsteen wrote another song for her, "[[Protection (Donna Summer song)|Protection]]". Videos for the album were directed by [[Brian De Palma]] and [[John Sayles]]. Springsteen played on the "[[We Are the World]]" song and [[We Are the World (album)|album]] in 1985. His live track "Trapped" from that album received moderate airplay on US Top 40 stations as well as reaching No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Top Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CQEAAAAMBAJ&q=billboard%201985&pg=PT52 |title=Billboard |date=May 11, 1985 |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref>

The ''Born in the U.S.A.'' period represented the height of Springsteen's visibility in popular culture and the broadest audience he would ever reach (aided by the release of [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]'s [[remix|dance mixes]] of three of the singles). From June 15 to August 10, 1985, all seven of his albums appeared on the [[UK Albums Chart]]: the first time an artist had charted their entire back catalogue simultaneously.<ref>Roberts, David.

''[[Live/1975–85]]'', a five-record box set (also on three cassettes or three CDs), was released near the end of 1986 and became the first box set to debut at No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. It is one of the most commercially successful live albums of all time, ultimately selling 13&nbsp;million units in the U.S. During the 1980s, several Springsteen [[fanzines]] were launched, including ''[[Backstreets Magazine|Backstreets]]'' magazine.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Springsteen released the much more sedate and contemplative ''[[Tunnel of Love (album)|Tunnel of Love]]'' album in 1987. The album is a mature reflection on the many faces of love found, lost and squandered, which only selectively used the E Street Band.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

On July 19, 1988, Springsteen held a [[Berlin Wall#Bruce Springsteen, 1988|concert in East Germany]] that attracted 300,000 spectators. Journalist Erik Kirschbaum has called the concert "the most important rock concert ever, anywhere", in his 2013 book ''Rocking the Wall. Bruce Springsteen: The Berlin Concert That Changed the World''. It had been conceived by the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]]'s [[Free German Youth|youth wing]] in an attempt to placate the youth of East Germany, who were hungry for more freedom and the popular music of the West. However, it is Kirschbaum's opinion that the success of the concert catalyzed opposition to the regime in the DDR, and helped contribute to the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] the following year.<ref>{{cite news

===1992–1998: Ups, downs, and soundtracks===
In 1992, after risking fan accusations of "going Hollywood" by moving to Los Angeles and working with [[session musician]]s, Springsteen released two albums at once: ''[[Human Touch]]'' and ''[[Lucky Town]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

An electric band appearance on the acoustic ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' television program (later released as ''[[In Concert/MTV Plugged]]'') was poorly received and cemented fan dissatisfaction.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Springsteen seemed to realize this a few years hence when he spoke humorously of his late father during his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame acceptance speech:

{{quote|"I've gotta thank him because—what would I conceivably have written about without him? I mean, you can imagine that if everything had gone great between us, we would have had disaster.

Springsteen won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 1994 for his song "[[Streets of Philadelphia]]", which appeared on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''. The video for the song shows Springsteen's actual vocal performance, recorded using a hidden microphone, to a prerecorded instrumental track. This technique was developed on the "[[Brilliant Disguise#Video|Brilliant Disguise]]" video.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

In 1995, after temporarily re-organizing the E Street Band for a few new songs recorded for his first ''[[Greatest Hits (Bruce Springsteen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album (a recording session that was chronicled in the documentary ''[[Blood Brothers (1996 film)|Blood Brothers]]''), and also one show at Tramps in New York City,{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} he released his second folk album, ''[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]]''. The album was inspired by [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' and by ''Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass'', a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author [[Dale Maharidge]] and photographer [[Michael Williamson (photographer)|Michael Williamson]]. The album was generally less well-received than the similar ''Nebraska'' due to the minimal [[melody]], twangy vocals, and political nature of most of the songs; however, some praised it for giving voice to immigrants and others who rarely have one in American culture. The lengthy, worldwide, small-venue solo acoustic [[Ghost of Tom Joad Tour]] that followed successfully presented many of his older songs in drastically reshaped acoustic form, although Springsteen had to explicitly remind his audiences to be quiet and not to clap during the performances.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Following the tour, Springsteen moved from California back to New Jersey with his family.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002987-2,00.html |title=Bruce Rising |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |last1=Tyrangiel |first1=Josh |first2=Kate |last2=Carcaterra |date=August 5, 2002 |work=Time |pages=2 of 6 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224174330/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1002987-2%2C00.html |archive-date=December 24, 2007 }}</ref> In 1998, he released the sprawling, four-disc [[box set]] of [[outtake]]s, ''[[Tracks (Bruce Springsteen album)|Tracks]]''.

In 1999, Springsteen and the E Street Band reunited and began their extensive [[Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band Reunion Tour|Reunion Tour]], which lasted over a year. Highlights included a record sold-out, 15-show run at [[Continental Airlines Arena]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]] and a ten-night, sold-out engagement at New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]]. A new song, "[[American Skin (41 Shots)]]", about the police shooting of [[Amadou Diallo]], which was played at these shows proved controversial.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

In 2002, Springsteen released his first studio effort with the full band in 18 years, ''[[The Rising (album)|The Rising]]'', produced by [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]]. The album, mostly a reflection on the [[September 11 attacks]], was a critical and popular success. [[The Rising (Bruce Springsteen song)|The title track]] gained airplay in several radio formats, and the record became Springsteen's best-selling album of new material in 15 years. Kicked off by an early-morning Asbury Park appearance on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', [[The Rising Tour]] commenced; the band barnstormed through a series of single-night arena stands in the U.S. and Europe.

''[[Devils & Dust]]'' was released on April 26, 2005, and was recorded without the E Street Band. It is a low-key, mostly acoustic album, in the same vein as ''Nebraska'' and ''The Ghost of Tom Joad''.

Despite comments from Springsteen in late 2019 about a potential new album and tour with the E Street Band in 2020, on February 12, 2020, Steven Van Zandt cast some doubt over a 2020 tour saying "Let's just say I thought I was going to be busier than I am.

In a September 20, 2020, interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Springsteen said that he did not expect to tour again until at least 2022: "My antenna tells me, at best, 2022. And I would consider the concert industry lucky if it happens then. I'm going to consider myself lucky if I lose just a year of touring life. Once you hit 70, there's a finite amount of tours and a finite amount of years that you have. And so you lose one or two, that's not so great." Springsteen also confirmed that the long rumored follow-up to his ''Tracks'' outtakes box set was in the works, saying "There's a lot of really good music left.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bruce-springsteen-interview-new-album-touring-e-street-band-1059109/|title=Ghosts, Guitars, and the E Street Shuffle|website=rollingstone.com|date= September 20, 2020|accessdate=September 23, 2020}}</ref>

While rejecting religion in his earlier years, Springsteen stated in his autobiography ''Born to Run'', "I have a personal relationship with Jesus. I believe in his power to save, love [...] but not to damn." In terms of his [[lapsed Catholic]]ism, he has stated that he "came to ruefully and bemusedly understand that once you're a Catholic you're always a Catholic". He elaborated, "I don't participate in my religion but I know somewhere... deep inside... I'm still on the team."<ref>Deigan, Tom.

Springsteen dated actress [[Joyce Hyser]] for four years in the early 1980s.

They soon started spending time together and became friends.<ref>Interview with Patti Scialfa, "Red-Headed Woman", page 42–44, ''[[Q magazine|Q]]'' magazine, 1993</ref>

Early in 1984 Springsteen asked Scialfa to join the E Street Band for the upcoming Born in the U.S.A. Tour. According to the book ''Bruce Springsteen on Tour 1969–2005'' by Dave Marsh, they seemed about to become a couple through the first leg of the tour,{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} until Barry Bell introduced actress {{nowrap|[[Julianne Phillips]]}} to Springsteen and they were married shortly after midnight on {{nowrap|May 13, 1985}} at Our Lady of the Lake Catholic Church in [[Lake Oswego, Oregon]].<ref name=bbmtmo>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0x9ZAAAAIBAJ&pg=6128%2C328108 |work=The Bulletin |location=(Bend, Oregon) |agency=UPI |title=Springsteen, model married this morning |date=May 13, 1985 |page=A1}}</ref><ref name=baffwew>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GFoaAAAAIBAJ&pg=6646%2C2812331 |work=Spokane Chronicle |location=(Washington) |title=Bruce, actress fool fans with early wedding |date=May 13, 1985 |page=B2}}</ref><ref name=ergseccer>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MPFVAAAAIBAJ&pg=3099%2C3593205 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon)|agency=Associated Press|title=Springsteen marries in secret ceremony |date=May 14, 1985 |page=1A}}</ref> Opposites in background, the two had an {{nowrap|11-year}} age difference, and Springsteen's traveling took its toll on their relationship.

Springsteen received press criticism for the haste in which he and Scialfa started their relationship. In a 1995 interview with ''The Advocate'', he told Judy Wieder about the negative publicity the couple subsequently received: "It's a strange society that assumes it has the right to tell people whom they should love and whom they shouldn't. But the truth is, I basically ignored the entire thing as much as I could. I said, 'Well, all I know is, this feels real, and maybe I have got a mess going here in some fashion, but that's life.'"<ref name="Wieder1995"/> Years later, he reflected, "'I didn't protect Juli... some sort of public announcement would have been fair, but I felt overly concerned about my own privacy.
