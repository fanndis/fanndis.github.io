'''San Mateo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|æ|n|_|m|ə|ˈ|t|eɪ|.|oʊ}} {{respell|SAN|_|mə|TAY|oh}}; {{langnf||Spanish|"[[Saint Matthew]]"}}) is a city in [[San Mateo County, California]], about {{convert|20|mi}} south of [[San Francisco]], and {{convert|31|mi}} northwest of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. San Mateo had an estimated 2019 population of 104,430.<ref name="USCensusEst2019">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2019.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 21, 2020}}</ref>  It has a [[Mediterranean climate]], and is known for its rich history. The biggest economic contributors to the city include the Medical Center, one of the local [[San Mateo-Foster City School District|school districts]], and Sony's [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]] division. Finally, being in the center of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], it has many ways to travel beween the major cities of that area.

==History==
{{more citations|date=May 2020}}
San Mateo is filled with history starting from 1856. San Mateo is home to Hillsdale High school, which has one of the best high school football teams. Their logo is the fighting knigts. Documented by Spanish colonists as part of the [[Rancho de las Pulgas]] (literally "Ranch of the Fleas") and the [[Rancho San Mateo]], the earliest history is held in the archives of [[Mission Dolores]]. In 1789, the Spanish missionaries had named a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] village along Laurel Creek as ''Los Laureles'' or the Laurels (Mission Dolores, 1789).  At the time of Mexican Independence,  30 native Californians were at San Mateo, most likely from the Salson tribelet.<ref name=SMCH>{{cite book|last1=Postel|first1=Mitchell P.|title=San Mateo :a centennial history|date=1994|publisher=Scottwall Associates, Publishers|location=San Francisco, Calif.|isbn=978-0-942087-08-6|page=13|edition=1st}}</ref>

Captain Fredrick W. Beechey in 1827 traveling with the hills on their right, known in that part as the Sierra del Sur, began to approach the road, which passing over a small eminence, opened out upon "a wide country of meadow land, with clusters of fine oak free from underwood… It strongly resembled a nobleman's park: herds of cattle and horses were grazing upon the rich pasture, and numerous fallow‑deer, startled at the approach of strangers, bounded off to seek protection among the hills… This spot is named San Matheo, and belongs to the mission of San Francisco."<ref name="SMCH"/>  An 1835 sketch map of the Rancho refers to the creek as ''Arroyo de Los Laureles.'' In the 21st century, most of the laurels are gone, having been removed for development.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1810, Coyote Point was an early recorded feature of San Mateo.  Beginning in the 1850s, some wealthy San Franciscans began building summer or permanent homes in the milder midpeninsula.  While most of this early settlement occurred in adjacent [[Hillsborough, California|Hillsborough]] and Burlingame, a number of historically important mansions and buildings were constructed in San Mateo.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

[[Amadeo Giannini|A.P. Giannini]], founder of the [[Bank of Italy (USA)|Bank of Italy]] (which later became the [[Bank of America]]), lived here most of his life. His mansion, Seven Oaks, is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (No. 99001181). Located at 20 El Cerrito Avenue, it has been deteriorating as it has not been preserved or occupied for years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 1858, Sun Water Station, a stage station of the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] route, was established in San Mateo. It was located 9 miles south of Clarks Station in what is now [[San Bruno]] and 9 miles north of the next station at [[Redwood City]].<ref>Waterman L. Ormsby, Lyle H. Wright, Josephine M. Bynum, ''The Butterfield Overland Mail: Only Through Passenger on the First Westbound Stage'', Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery, 2007. pp. 92–93</ref>

The Howard Estate was built in 1859 on the hill accessed by Crystal Springs Road. The Parrott Estate was erected in 1860 in the same area, giving rise to two conflicting names for the hill, Howard Hill and Parrot Hill. After use of the automobile changed traffic patterns, neither historic name was commonly applied to that hill.  The Borel Estate was developed near Borel Creek in 1874. It has been redeveloped since the late 20th century for use as modern offices and shops. The property is managed and owned by Borel Place Associates and the Borel Estate Company.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Hayward Park, the 1880 [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|American Queen Anne-style]] residence of [[Alvinza Hayward]] (often said to be "California's first millionaire" from his silver and banking fortunes), was built on an {{convert|800|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate in San Mateo which included a deer park and racetrack, roughly bounded by present-day El Camino Real (on the west), 9th Avenue (on the north), B Street (on the east) and 16th Avenue (on the south).<ref>{{cite report |url=http://www.cityofsanmateo.org/DocumentCenter/View/39689 |title=Historical Resource Evaluation Report: 25 – 31 9th Street, San Mateo, CA |author=architecture + history llc |date=5 October 2012 |publisher=City of San Mateo Community Development Department |accessdate=23 March 2015 }}</ref> A smaller portion of the property and the mansion, was converted into The Peninsula Hotel in 1908, following Hayward's death in 1904.

In the early 20th century, Japanese immigrants came to San Mateo to work in the salt ponds and flower industry. Although Japanese-Americans only account for 2.2% of the population today, they continue to be a major cultural influence and a draw for the rest of the region.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2015/01/27/new-tech-in-old-buildings-san-mateo-rides-boom-but-keeps-small-town-feel/ |title=San Mateo Rides Tech Boom But Keeps Small-Town Feel |author=Myrow, Rachel |date=27 January 2015 |newspaper=KQED News |accessdate=4 August 2015}}</ref> The Eugene J. De Sabla Japanese Teahouse and Garden was established in 1894 at 70 De Sabla Road, designed by Makoto Hagiwara, designer of the Japanese garden in [[Golden Gate Park]] in San Francisco. He arranged for Japanese artisans to be brought to the United States primarily for its teahouse construction. The parcel was purchased in 1988 by San Francisco businessman Achille Paladini and wife Joan, who have restored it. The garden features hundreds of varieties of plants and several rare trees. A large [[koi]] pond surrounds an island. The property was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1992.<ref>{{cite web |url={{NRHP url|id=92000965}} |title=National Register of Historic Places — Registration Form: de Sabla, Eugene J., Jr., Teahouse and Tea Garden |author=Widell, Cherilyn |date=30 July 1992 |website=United States Department of the Interior, National Park Service |accessdate=22 March 2015 }}</ref>

==Geography==
San Mateo is located at {{Coord|37|33|15|N|122|18|47|W|type:city}} (37.554286, −122.313044).<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|15.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|12.1|sqmi|km2}} are land and {{convert|3.8|sqmi|km2}} (23.63%) are covered by water.

The best-known natural area is [[Coyote Point Park]], a rock outcropped peninsula that juts out into the [[San Francisco Bay]]. The early Spanish navigators named it ''la punta de San Mateo.''<ref>Brown, 1975</ref> Crews of American cargo ships carrying grain in the bay renamed it ''Big Coyote''.<ref>(BLM, 1853).</ref> Sailors had a penchant for naming promontories at the edge of San Francisco Bay after the [[coyote]]; across the bay in Fremont are the Coyote Hills, part of [[Coyote Hills Regional Park]].  By the 1890s, the shore area was developed as a popular beach called San Mateo Beach. In 1842, the Spanish had named it ''playa de San Mateo''. Today, Coyote Point is home to [[CuriOdyssey]], formerly known as the Coyote Point Museum, a major [[natural history]] museum and wildlife center in the state. The [[Peninsula Humane Society]] is also situated at Coyote Point.

The variety of natural habitats includes mixed [[oak]] woodland, [[riparian]] zones, and bayland marshes. One [[endangered species]], the [[California clapper rail]], was sighted feeding on mudflats by the Third Avenue bridge in San Mateo.<ref>Pfeifle, 1980</ref>  The marsh areas are also likely habitat for the endangered [[salt marsh harvest mouse]], which inhabits the middle and high zones of salt and [[brackish]] [[marsh]]es, as well as for the endangered marsh plant, [[Point Reyes bird's beak]].

Sugarloaf Mountain, whose name has been documented in 1870, is a prominent landform between the forks of Laurel Creek.<ref>(Brown, 1975)</ref> In the late 20th century, this mixed oak woodland and chaparral habitat was a site of controversy related to proposals to develop a portion of the mountain for residential use. It has been preserved for use as park and open space area, and is home to the endangered [[mission blue butterfly]].

[[Sawyer Camp Trail]], located on the western edge of San Mateo along the [[Crystal Springs Reservoir]], is another popular destination for joggers, pedestrians, and bikers. This roughly 6-mile trail begins in San Mateo and stretches north toward Hillsborough and San Bruno, parallel to the 280 freeway.

==Climate==
San Mateo has a [[Mediterranean]] [[climate]] with warm, dry summers and mild, damp winters. The city is generally shielded from the [[Pacific Ocean]] by the [[Montara Mountain]] block of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], but two gaps in the mountains (the San Bruno Gap, between Montara Mountain and [[San Bruno Mountain]]; and the [[Crystal Springs Reservoir|Crystal Springs]] Gap, near where [[State Route 92 (California)|State Route 92]] meets [[State Route 35 (California)|State Route 35]], west of the [[College of San Mateo]]) can channel ocean weather, resulting in gusty afternoon winds that bring fog toward San Mateo in the late afternoon through early morning in the summer.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wb1cks8Qe4IC&pg=PA40 |title=Weather of the San Francisco Bay Region |author=Gilliam, Harold |edition=2nd |date=2002 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-0-520-22989-1 |pages=40–43 |chapter=The Four Seasons: Summer |accessdate=23 March 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baaqmd.gov/Divisions/Communications-and-Outreach/Air-Quality-in-the-Bay-Area/Bay-Area-Climatology/Subregions/Peninsula.aspx |title=Bay Area Climatology: Peninsula Subregion |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=4 October 2010 |website=Bay Area Air Quality Management District |accessdate=23 March 2015 }}</ref>
