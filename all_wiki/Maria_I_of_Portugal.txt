[[Dom (title)|Dona]] '''Maria I''' (English: ''Mary&nbsp;I''; 17 December 1734 – 20 March 1816) was [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Queen of Portugal]] from 1777 until her death in 1816. Known as '''Maria the Pious''' in Portugal and '''Maria the Mad''' in Brazil, she was the first undisputed [[queen regnant]] of Portugal and the first [[List of Brazilian monarchs|monarch of Brazil]]. With [[Napoleon]]'s European conquests, her court, then under the direction of her son [[John VI of Portugal|João]], the Prince Regent, moved to Brazil, then a Portuguese colony. Later on, Brazil would be elevated from the rank of a colony to that of a kingdom, with the consequential formation of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]].

==Early life==

[[File:Retrato da Infanta D. Maria Francisca Isabel Josefa.jpg|thumb|left|''D. Maria Francisca, [[Princess of Beira]], [[Duchess of Barcelos]]''; [[Francesco Pavona|Pavona]]; 1739.]]
Maria was born at the [[Ribeira Palace]] in [[Lisbon]] and baptized Maria Francisca Isabel Josefa Antónia Gertrudes Rita Joana. On the day of her birth, her grandfather, King [[John V of Portugal]], appointed her the [[Princess of Beira]].

When her father succeeded to the throne in 1750 as [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]], Maria, at age 16 and as his eldest child, became his [[heir presumptive]] and was given the traditional titles of [[Princess of Brazil]] and [[Duchess of Braganza]].

===Influence of the Marquis of Pombal===

Maria grew up in a time when her father's government was dominated completely by the first [[Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]]. Her father would often retire to the [[Queluz National Palace|Palace of Queluz]] which was later given to Maria and her husband. The Marquis took control of the government after the terrible [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] of 1 November 1755, in which around 100,000 people lost their lives.  (The palace of her birth was also destroyed in the disaster.)<ref name=Pombal>{{cite book|title=A history of Portugal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHI3AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA352 |publisher=CUP Archive |pages=352–375}}</ref>

After the earthquake, Maria's father was often uncomfortable at the thought of staying in enclosed spaces, and later suffered from [[claustrophobia]]. The king had a palace built in Ajuda, away from the city centre. This palace became known as Real Barraca de Ajuda (Royal Hut at Ajuda) because it was made of wood. The family spent much time at the large palace, and it was the birthplace of Maria's first child. In 1794 the palace burned to the ground and the [[Ajuda National Palace|Palace of Ajuda]] was built in its place.<ref name=Pombal/>

In 1760 Maria married her uncle [[Peter III of Portugal|Pedro]], younger brother of her father [[Joseph I of Portugal|Jose I]].  They had six children, of whom the eldest surviving son succeeded Maria as [[John VI of Portugal|João VI]] on her death in 1816.

==Reign==
[[File:Maria I, Vieira.jpg|thumb|right|''Maria Francisca Isabel, Princess of Brazil''; [[Vieira Lusitano]], 1753.]] 
In 1777, Maria became the first undisputed [[List of Portuguese monarchs|queen regnant of Portugal]]. With Maria's accession, her husband became king as Peter III. Despite Peter's status as king and the nominal joint reign, the actual regal authority was vested solely in Maria, as she was the lineal heir of the crown. Also, as Peter's kingship was ''[[iure uxoris|jure uxoris]]'' only, his reign would cease in the event of Maria's death, and the crown would pass to Maria's descendants. However, Peter predeceased his wife in 1786. Maria is considered to have been a good ruler in the period prior to her madness. Her first act as queen was to dismiss the popular [[Prime minister|secretary of state of the kingdom]], the Marquess of Pombal, who had broken the power of the reactionary aristocracy via the [[Távora affair]], partially because of Pombal's [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], anti-[[Jesuit]] policies. Noteworthy events of this period include Portugal's membership in the [[First League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]] (July 1782) and the 1781 cession of [[Delagoa Bay]] from [[Austria]] to Portugal.<ref name="Birmingham2018">{{cite book|author=Birmingham, David |title=A Concise History of Portugal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkFPDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA93 |year=2018 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-42419-6 |pages=93–107}}</ref>

Queen Maria suffered from religious mania and [[melancholia]]. This acute mental illness (perhaps due to [[porphyria]]) made her incapable of handling state affairs after 1792.<ref name="google1937">[https://books.google.com/books?id=fHI3AAAAIAAJ& History of Portugal: Pamphlet Collection]. CUP Archive, 1937. Accessed September 2012.</ref>

==Mental deterioration==
[[File:4 escudos en or à l'effigie de Marie I et Pierre III, 1785.jpg|thumb|Effigy of Maria I and Peter III, 1785]]
Maria's madness was first officially noticed in 1786, when Maria had to be carried back to her apartments in a state of delirium. Afterward, the queen's mental state became increasingly worse. In May 1786, her husband died; Maria was devastated and forbade any court entertainments. According to a contemporary account, state festivities began to resemble religious ceremonies. Her condition worsened after the death of her eldest son (and heir-apparent), aged 27, from smallpox, and of her [[confessor]], in 1791.<ref name=CUP/>

In February 1792, she was deemed mentally insane and was treated by [[Francis Willis (physician)|Francis Willis]], the same physician who attended King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III of Great Britain]]. Willis wanted to take her to England, but the plan was refused by the Portuguese court. Maria's second son (eldest surviving) and new heir-apparent, [[John VI of Portugal|John]], took over the government in her name, even though he only took the title of Prince Regent in 1799.<ref name="google1937"/>

When the Real Barraca de Ajuda burnt down in 1794, the court was forced to move to Queluz, where the ill queen would lie in her apartments all day. Visitors would complain of terrible screams that would echo throughout the palace.{{cn|date=June 2020}}

== Napoleonic Wars ==
[[File:Maria I de Portugal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engraving of Maria I from 1786]] 
In 1801 Spanish Prime Minister [[Manuel de Godoy, Prince of the Peace|Manuel de Godoy]] sent an army to invade Portugal with backing from [[Napoleon]], resulting in the [[War of the Oranges]]. Though the Spanish ended their invasion, the [[Treaty of Badajoz (1801)|Treaty of Badajoz]] on 6 June 1801 forced Portugal to cede [[Olivenza|Olivença]] and other border towns to Spain. (This cession is not recognized by the present Portuguese government, and the country officially considers those territories still to be Portuguese possessions.) On 29 September 1801 John VI signed the [[Treaty of Madrid (1801)]], ceding half of [[Portuguese Guyana]] to France, which became [[French Guiana]].<ref name=CUP>{{cite book|title=A history of Portugal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHI3AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA376 |publisher=CUP Archive |pages=376–403}}</ref>

The refusal of the Portuguese government to join the French-sponsored [[Continental Blockade]] against Britain culminated in the late 1807 Franco-Spanish invasion of Portugal led by [[Jean-Andoche Junot|General Junot]]. The ultimate Napoleonic plan for Portugal was to split it into three sections. The northern parts of Portugal, from the Douro to the Minho, would become the [[Kingdom of Northern Lusitania]], and its throne was promised to King [[Louis II of Etruria]]. The [[Alentejo|Alentejo Province]] and [[Kingdom of the Algarve]] would be merged to form the ''Principality of the Algarves'', of which Spanish Prime Minister [[Manuel de Godoy]] would be sovereign. The remaining portion of Portugal would have been directly ruled by France.<ref name=CUP/>

=== Transfer to Brazil ===
{{main article|Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil}}
At the urging of the [[United Kingdom|British]] government, the entire [[House of Braganza|Braganza Dynasty]] decided to flee on 29 November 1807 to establish a [[government in exile]] in the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese Viceroyalty of Brazil]]. Along with the royal family, Maria was transported aboard the [[carrack]] ''Príncipe Real''. During her move from the royal palace to the docks she was heard screaming throughout the trip, in the middle of the crowd and in the carriage. The queen's [[dementia]] was so great that she feared that she was going to be tortured or robbed during her movement by her servants.<ref name="Birmingham2018"/>

[[File:D.Mara.II - A Pia.png|thumb|right| ''Dona Maria I, Queen of Portugal''; José Leandro de Carvalho, 1808.]]
In January 1808 Prince Regent João and his court arrived in [[Salvador da Bahia]]. Under pressure by local aristocracy and the British, the prince regent signed a commercial regulation after his arrival that opened commerce between Brazil and friendly nations, which in this case represented the interests of Great Britain above all. This law broke an important colonial pact that had previously allowed Brazil to maintain direct commercial relations only with Portugal.<ref name="Birmingham2018"/>

On 1 August 1808 British General [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]] (later [[Duke of Wellington (title)|Duke of Wellington]]) landed a British army in Lisbon to  initiate the [[Peninsular War]]. The impact of Wellesley's initial victory over Junot at the [[Battle of Vimeiro]] (21 August 1808) was wiped out by his superiors in the [[Convention of Cintra]] (30 August 1808), which allowed the defeated French troops to evacuate peacefully from Portugal.<ref name=CUP/>

Wellesley (now as Lord Wellington) returned to Portugal on 22 April 1809 to recommence the campaign. Portuguese forces under British command distinguished themselves in the defence of the [[Lines of Torres Vedras]] (1809–1810) and in the subsequent invasion of Spain and France. In 1815 the government of the Prince Regent João elevated Brazil to the status of a kingdom, and Maria I was proclaimed the Queen of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]. When Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815, Maria and her family remained in Brazil.<ref name=CUP/>

== Death and legacy ==
[[File:Tomb of Maria I - Basílica da Estrela - Lisbon.JPG|thumb|left|Tomb of Maria I at [[Estrela Basilica]] in [[Lisbon]], Portugal]]
{{citations needed|date=October 2020}}
Maria lived in Brazil for a total of eight years, always in a state of incapacitation. In 1816, she died at the Carmo Convent in [[Rio de Janeiro]] at the age of 81. After her death, Prince Regent João was acclaimed the king of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves and his mother's body was returned to Lisbon to be interred in a mausoleum in the [[Estrela Basilica]] ({{lang-pt|Basilica da Estrela}}), which she had helped found.

Maria is a greatly admired figure in both Brazil and Portugal due to the tremendous changes and events that took place during her reign. In Portugal, she is celebrated as a strong female figure. Her legacy shines at Portugal's [[Queluz National Palace|Queluz Palace]], a baroque-roccoco masterpiece that she helped conceive. A large statue of her stands in front of the palace, and a [[Pousada of D. Maria|pousada]] near the palace is named in her honour. A large marble statue of the queen was erected at the [[Portuguese National Library]] in Lisbon by the students of Joaquim Machado de Castro.

In Brazil, she is admired as a key figure in the eventual [[independence of Brazil]]. It was during her reign, albeit through the government of her son's regency, that many of the national institutions and organizations in Brazil were created. These institutions were the precursors to their modern-day equivalents and granted large degree of power to the Brazilian colonials. While she is often called ''A Louca'' (the Mad) in Brazil, Brazilian and Portuguese historians hold her in high esteem.

== Marriage and issue ==
Maria married her uncle, [[Peter III of Portugal|Infante Pedro of Portugal]] on 6 June 1760. At the time of their marriage, Maria was 25 and Pedro was 42. Despite the age gap, the couple had a happy marriage. Peter automatically became co-monarch (as Pedro III of Portugal) when Maria ascended the throne, as a child had already been born from their marriage. The couple had six children and a stillborn baby.
