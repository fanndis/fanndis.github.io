===Private sector, 2004–2011===
In 2006, de Guindos was appointed advisor for [[Lehman Brothers]] in [[Europe]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16295059 |title=Spain names ex-Lehman executive as economy minister |work=[[BBC News]] |date=December 21, 2011 |access-date=June 10, 2012 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1221/spain-business.html |title=Spain's new Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has named ex-Lehman Brothers banker Luis de Guindos in the pivotal job as economy minister |work=[[RTÉ News]] |date=December 21, 2011 |access-date=June 10, 2012 |publisher=[[RTÉ]]}}</ref> and director of its subsidiary bank in Spain and [[Portugal]], where he remained until the collapse and declaration of bankruptcy of the latter in 2008. Subsequently, de Guindos became responsible for the finance division of [[Pricewaterhouse Coopers]]. Finally, and in a largely ceremonial role, he was appointed as a professor of finance at the PwC and IE Financial Sector Center of IE Business School (Madrid), between 2010-2012, before joining as a minister.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2010/02/02/actualidad/1265099590_850215.html |title=Luis de Guindos deja Pricewaterhouse y pasa al Instituto de Empresa |newspaper=[[El Pais]] |date=February 2, 2010 |access-date=June 10, 2012 |language=es |publisher=[[Prisa]] |location=Madrid}}</ref> He was also a board member of [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa SA]], a Spanish power company.<ref>{{cite news |first=Emma |last=Ross-Thomas |first2=Charles |last2=Penty |date=December 22, 2011 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-12-21/spanish-premier-rajoy-appoints-montoro-de-guindos-to-economy-ministries |title=Lehman Banker, Budget Expert Picked to Steer Spain's Economy |magazine=[[Bloomberg Business]] |access-date=3 May 2019 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]}}</ref>

From 2011, de Guindos worked for the board of Mare Nostrum Bank,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=118467589&privcapId=118466736&previousCapId=118466736&previousTitle=Banco%20Mare%20Nostrum,%20S.A. |title=Commercial Banks: Company Overview of Banco Mare Nostrum, S.A. |access-date=June 10, 2012 |magazine=[[Businessweek]] |date=18 January 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130118135835/http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=118467589&privcapId=118466736&previousCapId=118466736&previousTitle=Banco%20Mare%20Nostrum,%20S.A. |archive-date=18 January 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> which was formed in 2010 from a merger of savings banks, until he resigned to become part of the [[Rajoy I Government|Rajoy government]] led by [[Mariano Rajoy]] in December of that year.

===Minister of Economy and Competitiveness, 2011-2018===
De Guindos has served as economy minister in Rajoy's centre-right government since it took office in December 2011 and is credited with steering Spain to economic recovery following the euro zone's [[European debt crisis|2009-2014 crisis]].<ref>Robin Emmott (April 25, 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/25/eurozone-eurogroup-idUSL8N0XM09520150425 Spain to bid for euro zone chair in challenge to Dijsselbloem] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> He played a crucial role in negotiating the European Union's €100 billion bailout of Spain's stricken savings banks, and in spearheading the country's overhaul of the banking sector, labour market and other parts of the economy.<ref>Tobias Buck and Peter Spiegel (June 9, 2015), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/746efea0-0e88-11e5-9ae0-00144feabdc0.html De Guindos fights for eurogroup job, with Spanish pride at stake] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> His implementation of a program of both structural reforms and austerity measures has earned praise from Spain's European partners and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), which estimated that no country other than [[Greece]] had implemented more structural reforms than Spain.<ref>Nicholas Hirst (October 2, 2014), [http://www.politico.eu/article/luis-de-guindos-reform-champion/ Luis de Guindos: reform champion] ''[[Politico Europe|European Voice]]''.</ref>

In 2012, de Guindos and Rajoy initially blocked the appointment of [[Yves Mersch]] to succeed [[José Manuel González Paramo]] as member of the [[Executive Board of the European Central Bank]], instead putting forward ECB General Counsel Antonio Sáinz de Vicuña y Barroso for the role.<ref>Andrew Gardner (November 22, 2013), [http://www.politico.eu/article/mersch-appointed-to-ecb/ Mersch appointed to ECB] ''[[European Voice]]''.</ref> At the time, analysts said that if Spain had nominated de Guindo's predecessor [[Elena Salgado]] for the board, she would have been a shoo-in instead of Mersch who was ultimately elected.<ref>Claire Davenport (November 5, 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecb-mersch-spain-idUSBRE8A40QI20121105 Spain opposes appointment of Yves Mersch to ECB] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In January 2014, de Guindos was elected co-chair (alongside [[Anders Borg]], later [[Valdis Dombrovskis]]) of the [[European People's Party|EPP Economic and Financial Affairs Ministers Meeting]], which gathers the center-right [[European People's Party]] (EPP) ministers ahead of meetings of the [[Economic and Financial Affairs Council]] (ECOFIN.<ref>[http://www.epp.eu/about-us/structure/ Council of the EU and Ministerial meetings] [[European People’s Party]] (EPP).</ref><ref>[http://news.epp.eu/z3sLbd Spain: Luis de Guindos appointed Co-Chairman of the EPP Ecofin Ministers group] [[European People’s Party]] (EPP), press release of 28 January 2014.</ref> In August 2014, German [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]], who also belongs to the EPP political bloc, gave him her backing in his bid to succeed [[Jeroen Dijsselbloem]] as leading the [[Eurogroup]] from mid-2015;<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/business/2014/0825/639250-merkel/ Merkel backs Spain economy minister to lead Eurogroup] ''[[RTÉ News and Current Affairs]]'', August 25, 2014.</ref> Securing the Eurogroup post for de Guindos was a key political goal for Rajoy, who hoped that his appointment will cement perceptions both at home and abroad that Spain has emerged from crisis and can be taken seriously once again at international level.<ref>Tobias Buck and Peter Spiegel (August 25, 2014), [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/81403dd2-2c49-11e4-a0b6-00144feabdc0.html Angela Merkel backs Luis de Guindos to chair eurozone finance ministers’ group] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> Meanwhile, on 5 June 2015, Dijsselbloem announced he would seek a second term, prompting de Guindos saying he would mount a challenge.<ref>Toby Sterling (June 5, 2015), [http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/05/uk-eurogroup-chairman-dijsselbloem-idUKKBN0OL17620150605 Netherlands' Dijsselbloem seeks second term as Eurogroup president] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> At a Eurogroup meeting in July 2015, Dijsselbloem picked up 10 votes, with the remaining countries subsequently deciding to vote unanimously for his second term.<ref>Zeke Turner (July 13, 2015), [http://www.politico.eu/article/dijsselbloem-second-term-spain-eurogroup-ecb/ Dijsselbloem secures second term] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref>

In late 2015, de Guindos announced that Spain would have a [[Government budget balance|budget deficit]] of less than 3 percent of GDP by 2016.<ref>Gernot Heller (September 1, 2015), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eurozone-spain-germany-idUSKCN0R12ZH20150901 Spain is best example that Europe is doing things right: Schaeuble] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> However, after the country missed its 2015 public deficit target of 4.2 percent during months of fruitless coalition talks following inconclusive [[2015 Spanish general election|national elections]], Rajoy and de Guindos signaled they were open to asking the [[European Commission]] for flexibility on the target.<ref>Rodrigo de Miguel and Sarah White (February 12, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-economy-idUSKCN0VL1BP Spain likely missed deficit goal in 2015: economy minister] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> When the Commission eventually began [[Stability and Growth Pact|formal disciplinary procedures]] against Spain and Portugal in 2016 for their excessive deficits in 2014 and 2015, de Guindos publicly promised that Spain would escape any sanctions from the European Union.<ref>Jesus Aguado (July 7, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-deficit-spain-guindos-idUSKCN0ZN24P Spain says will escape EU deficit sanction, set new fiscal path] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

When Spain's acting [[Ministry of Industry (Spain)|Industry Minister]] [[José Manuel Soria]] resigned in April 2016 following allegations of links to offshore dealings which emerged after he was named in the [[Panama Papers]], de Guindos took on Soria's brief alongside his current responsibilities.<ref>Paul Day (April 15, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-spain-idUSKCN0XC0OJ Spanish minister resigns after links to offshore deals alleged] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> De Guindos continued to be in charge of the newly expanded portfolio in the [[second Rajoy Government]] from November 2016 on.<ref>Adrian Croft and Jesús Aguado (November 4, 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-politics-cabinet-idUSKBN12Y2FS Cabinet reshaped by Spain's Rajoy draws strong opposition criticism] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

In 2017, de Guindos was widely seen as a natural successor to replace [[Jeroen Dijsselbloem]] as next chairman of the [[Eurogroup]] but he ruled himself out early in favour of an expected candidacy to become [[President of the European Central Bank|Vice-President]] of the [[European Central Bank]].<ref>Mehreen Khan (December 5, 2017), [https://www.ft.com/content/4d176586-d98d-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482 The Eurogroup’s revolution is on hold] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> After [[Ireland]] withdrew the candidacy of [[Philip R. Lane|Philip Lane]] in February 2018, German Finance Minister [[Peter Altmaier]] was one of the first among his peers to openly endorse de Guindos.<ref>Maria Tadeo and Carolynn Look (February 19, 2018), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-19/spain-secures-ecb-for-guindos-after-long-campaign-to-regain-seat Spain Secures ECB for Guindos After Long Campaign to Regain Seat] ''[[Bloomberg News]]''.</ref>

In March 2018, De Guindos finally left his position as Minister and [[Román Escolano]] replaced him.  On 14 March 2018, a majority of the European Parliament endorsed him as new ECB Vice-President.<ref>http://www.europarl.europa.eu: [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20180309IPR99426/parliament-endorses-luis-de-guindos-as-new-ecb-vice-president ''Parliament endorses Luis de Guindos as new ECB Vice-President'']</ref>

==Political positions==
De Guindos, who is married with two children, is a practicing Roman Catholic. In September 2014, he attended the [[beatification]] of one of the leaders of the conservative [[Opus Dei]] movement.
