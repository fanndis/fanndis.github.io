The '''British Academy of Film and Television Arts''' ('''BAFTA''', {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|f|t|ə}}<ref>{{cite EPD|18}}</ref>) is an independent charity that supports, develops and promotes the art forms of the moving image (film, television and games) in the United Kingdom. In addition to its annual awards ceremonies, BAFTA has an international programme of learning events and initiatives offering access to talent through workshops, masterclasses, scholarships, lectures and mentoring schemes in the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Origins==
BAFTA started out as the '''British Film Academy''', founded in 1947 by a group of directors: [[David Lean]], [[Alexander Korda]], [[Roger Manvell]], [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Emeric Pressburger]], [[Michael Powell]], [[Michael Balcon]], [[Carol Reed]], and other major figures of the British film industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/print/heritage/features/david-lean/david-leans-letter-to-the-academy,55,GAL.html |title=David Lean's Letter to the Academy |publisher=Bafta.org |date= |accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000123/overview|title=BAFTA Awards: Overview|access-date=2017-07-31}}</ref>

David Lean was the founding chairman of the academy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/heritage/features/sir-david-lean-1908-1991|title=Sir David Lean (1908–1991)|website=www.bafta.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-31}}</ref> The first Film Awards ceremony took place in May 1949, honouring the films ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'', ''[[Odd Man Out]]'' and ''[[The World Is Rich]]''.

The '''Guild of Television Producers and Directors''' was set up in 1953 with the first awards ceremony in October 1954, and in 1958 merged with the British Film Academy to form the '''Society of Film and Television Arts''', whose inaugural meeting was held at Buckingham Palace and presided over by the Duke of Edinburgh.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1976, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]] and [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|The Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] officially opened the organisation's headquarters at 195 [[Piccadilly]], London, and in March the society became the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Recent events==
On 2 February 2018, Bafta formally terminated [[Harvey Weinstein]]'s membership. On 26 October 2017, after the 2008 Bafta Awards, Norwegian actress [[Natassia Malthe]] had accused Weinstein of raping her in a London hotel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41594672 |title=Harvey Weinstein timeline: How the scandal unfolded |date=29 May 2020 |website=BBC News |access-date=10 June 2020}}</ref>

===Learning events and initiatives===
In addition to its high-profile awards ceremonies, BAFTA manages a year-round programme of educational events and initiatives including film screenings and Q&As, tribute evenings, interviews, lectures, and debates with major industry figures. With over 250 events a year, BAFTA's stated aim is to inspire and inform the next generation of talent by providing a platform for some of the world's most talented practitioners to pass on their knowledge and experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/about/learning,2836,BA.html |title=BAFTA's Commitment to Learning – About – The BAFTA site |publisher=Bafta.org |date= |accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref>

===Scholarships===
BAFTA runs a number of scholarship programmes across the UK, US and Asia.

Launched in 2012, the UK programme enables talented British citizens who are in need of financial support to take an industry-recognised course in film, television or games in the UK. Each BAFTA Scholar receives up to £12,000 towards their annual course fees, and mentoring support from a BAFTA member and free access to BAFTA events around the UK. Since 2013, three students every year have received one of the Prince William Scholarships in Film, Television and Games, supported by BAFTA and Warner Bros. These scholarships are awarded in the name of [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] in his role as president of BAFTA.

In the US, BAFTA Los Angeles offers financial support and mentorship to British graduate students studying in the US, as well as scholarships to provide financial aid to local LA students from the inner city. BAFTA New York's Media Studies Scholarship Program, set up in 2012, supports students pursuing media studies at undergraduate and graduate level institutions within the New York City area and includes financial aid and mentoring opportunities.

Since 2015, BAFTA has been offering scholarships for British citizens to study in China, vice versa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/media-centre/press-releases/bafta-awards-scholarships-to-students-in-the-uk-and-us|title=BAFTA Awards Scholarships To Students In The UK And US|website=www.bafta.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}</ref>

===BAFTA awards===
[[File:BAFTA award.jpg|thumb|The BAFTA award, designed by Mitzi Cunliffe|upright=0.85]]
The BAFTA award trophy is a mask, designed by American sculptor [[Mitzi Cunliffe]]. When the Guild merged with the British Film Academy to become the Society of Film and Television Arts, later the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, the first 'BAFTA award' was presented to Sir [[Charles Chaplin]] on his Academy Fellowship that year.

A BAFTA award – including the bronze mask and marble base – weighs {{cvt|3.7|kg}} and measures {{cvt|27|cm}} high x {{cvt|14|cm}} wide x {{cvt|8|cm}} deep; the mask itself measures {{cvt|16|cm}} high x {{cvt|14|cm}} wide. They are made of [[phosphor bronze]] and cast in a Middlesex [[foundry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/entertainment-arts-51328041/bafta-masks-the-foundry-that-makes-bronze-trophies |title=Bafta masks: The foundry that makes bronze trophies |website=BBC News |date=1 February 2020 |access-date=10 June 2020}}</ref>

===Awards ceremonies===
====Film Awards====<!-- This section is linked from [[Blade Runner]] -->
{{main|British Academy Film Awards}}
BAFTA's annual film awards ceremony is known as the British Academy Film Awards,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/film/awards |title=BAFTA Film Awards |publisher=Bafta.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-28}}</ref> or "the BAFTAs", and reward the best work of any nationality seen on British cinema screens during the preceding year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/film/awards |title=EE British Academy Film Awards |publisher=BAFTA |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref> In 1949 the British Film Academy, as it was then known, presented the first awards for films made in 1947 and 1948. Since 2008 the ceremony has been held at the [[Royal Opera House]] in London's [[Covent Garden]]. It had been held in the [[Odeon Leicester Square|Odeon cinema]] on Leicester Square since 2000. 
Since 2017, the BAFTA ceremony has been held at the Royal Albert Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/royal-baftas-2017/|title=Royal BAFTAs|publisher=Ikon London Magazine| last1 = Orlova-Alvarez | first1 = Tamara| last2 = Alvarez | first2 = Joe| date=13 February 2017|accessdate=23 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/baftas-2018/|title=Jennifer Lawrence EE British Academy Film and Television Awards | publisher=Ikon London Magazine | last1 = Orlova-Alvarez | first1 = Tamara| last2 = Alvarez | first2 = Joe | date=13 February 2018 | accessdate=23 February 2018}}</ref> The ceremony had been performed during April or May of each year, but since 2002 it has been held in February to precede the academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' (AMPAS) [[Academy Awards]], or Oscars.

In order for a film to be considered for a BAFTA nomination its first public exhibition must be displayed in a cinema and it must have a UK theatrical release for no fewer than seven days of the calendar year that corresponds to the upcoming awards. A movie must be of feature length and movies from all countries are eligible in all categories, with the exception of the [[BAFTA Award for Best British Film|Alexander Korda Award for Outstanding British Film]] and [[Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer|Outstanding Debut]] which are for British films or individuals only.

====Television Awards and Television Craft Awards====
{{main|British Academy Television Awards|British Academy Television Craft Awards}}

The British Academy Television Awards ceremony usually takes place during April or May, with its sister ceremony, the British Academy Television Craft Awards, usually occurring within a few weeks of it.

The Television Awards, celebrating the best TV programmes and performances of the past year, are also often referred to simply as "the BAFTAs" or, to differentiate them from the movie awards, the "BAFTA Television Awards". They have been awarded annually since 1954. The first ever ceremony consisted of six categories. Until 1958, they were awarded by the [[Guild of Television Producers and Directors]].

From 1968 until 1997, BAFTA's Film and Television Awards were presented together, but from 1998 onwards they were presented at two separate ceremonies.

The Television Craft Awards celebrate the talent behind the programmes, such as individuals working in visual effects, production, and costume design.

Only British programmes are eligible – with the potential exception of the publicly voted Audience Award – but any [[cable television|cable]], [[satellite television|satellite]], [[analogue television|terrestrial]] or [[digital television]] stations broadcasting in the UK are eligible to submit entries, as are independent production companies who have produced programming for the channels. Individual performances can either be entered by the performers themselves or by the broadcasters. The programmes being entered must have been broadcast on or between 1 January and 31 December of the year preceding the awards ceremony.

Since 2014 the "BAFTA Television Awards" have been open to TV programmes which are only broadcast online.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lizo Mzimba |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24345126 |title=BBC News – Bafta opens TV awards up to online shows |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref>

====Games Awards====
{{main|British Academy Games Awards}}
The British Academy Games Awards ceremony traditionally takes place in March, shortly after the Film Awards ceremony in February.

BAFTA first recognised video games and other interactive media at its inaugural ''[[BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards]]'' ceremony during 1998, the first major change of its rules since the admittance of television thirty years earlier. Among the first winning games were ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'', ''[[Gran Turismo (1997 video game)|Gran Turismo]]'' and interactive comedy ''[[MindGym]]'', sharing the spotlight with the ''[[BBC News Online]]'' website which won the news category four years consecutively. These awards allowed the academy to recognise new forms of entertainment that were engaging new audiences and challenging traditional expressions of creativity.

During 2003, the sheer ubiquity of interactive forms of entertainment and the breadth of genres and types of video games outgrew the combined ceremony, and the event was divided into the ''[[British Academy Video Games Awards|BAFTA Video Games Awards]]'' and the BAFTA Interactive Awards<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3253818.stm |title=Technology &#124; Multimedia's best in Bafta battle |work=BBC News |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref> Despite making headlines with high-profile winners like ''[[Halo 2]]'' and ''[[Half-Life 2]]'' the interactive division was discontinued and disappeared from BAFTA's publicity material after only two ceremonies.

During 2006, BAFTA announced its decision "to give video games equal status with film and television", and the academy now advertises video games as its third major topic in recognition of its importance as an art form of moving images. The same year the ceremony was performed at [[The Roundhouse]] by Chalk Farm Road in [[North London]] on 5 October and was televised for the first time on 17 October and was broadcast on the digital channel [[E4 (channel)|E4]].

Since 2009, the ceremonies have been performed at the London Hilton Park Lane and Tobacco Dock, London, and have been hosted by [[Dara Ó Briain]] and [[Rufus Hound]].

====Children's Awards====
{{main|British Academy Children's Awards}}
The British Academy Children's Awards are presented annually during November to reward excellence in the art forms of the moving image intended for children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/childrens |title=British Academy Children's Awards |publisher=Bafta.org |date=24 November 2013 |accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref> They have been awarded annually since 1969.

The academy has a long history of recognising and rewarding children's programming, presenting two awards at the 1969 ceremony – The Flame of Knowledge Award for Schools Programmes and the Harlequin Award for Children's Programmes.

{{as of|2010}} the Awards ceremony includes 19 categories across movies, television, video games and online content.

Since 2007 the Children's Awards have included a Kids Vote award, voted by children between seven and 14. BAFTA Kids Vote is the annual competition for children aged between seven and 12 which is now part of BAFTA's year-round BAFTA Kids programme of activity helping children "discover, explore and find out more about the worlds of films, television and games by providing content, information and experiences". The [[CBBC]] Me and My Movie award, a children's filmmaking initiative to inspire and enable children to make their own movies and tell their own stories, has been discontinued.

====BAFTA Student Film Awards====
BAFTA also hosts the annual [[BAFTA Student Film Awards]] as showcase for rising industry talent. The animation award was sponsored in 2017 and 2018 by animation studio [[Laika (company)|Laika]]. <ref>[https://variety.com/2018/film/news/bafta-2018-student-film-awards-finalists-1202818874/ Variety.com 22 May 2018] Retrieved 20 March 2019</ref>

===Britannia Awards===
