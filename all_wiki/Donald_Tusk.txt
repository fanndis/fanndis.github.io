Tusk has been involved in Polish politics since the early 1990s, having founded several political parties and held elected office almost continuously since 1991. Tusk was one of the co-founders of the [[free market|free-market]]-oriented [[Liberal Democratic Congress]] party. He entered the [[Sejm]] (lower chamber of Poland's parliament) in 1991, but lost his seat in the 1993 election which went badly for the Congress.

In 1994, the Congress merged with the [[Democratic Union (Poland)|Democratic Union]] to form the [[Freedom Union (Poland)|Freedom Union]]. In 1997, Tusk was elected to the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]], and became its [[Marshal of the Senate|deputy speaker]]. In 2001, he co-founded another [[centre-right]] [[liberal conservative]] party, [[Civic Platform]] (PO), and he was again elected to the Sejm, and became its [[Marshal of the Sejm|deputy speaker]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Donald-Tusk |title=Donald Tusk |access-date=29 October 2017}}</ref>

He was elected prime minister in 2007 and with his party's victory in the [[2011 Polish parliamentary election]], he became the first Prime Minister to be re-elected since the [[fall of Communism in Poland]].<ref name="PSL want to continue coalition in next year's general election">{{cite news|title=PSL want to continue coalition in next year's general election|url=http://www.thenews.pl/national/?id=143700|publisher=[[Polskie Radio]]|date=18 November 2010|accessdate=20 December 2010}}</ref> In 2014, he became [[president of the European Council]] and was re-elected to this position in 2017.

Tusk has described the city of his youth as "a typical frontier town" with "many borders ... between ethnicities". This, together with his Kashubian ethnic ancestry and multilingual family, meant that he grew up with an awareness that "nothing is simple in life or in history", which informed his adult political view that it is "best to be immune to every kind of orthodoxy, of ideology and most importantly, nationalism". He has described his young life under communism as "so hopeless" due to the boredom and monotony, with "no hope for anything to change". His young self was a "typical hooligan" who often got into fights - "we would roam the streets, you know, cruising for a bruising."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/72d9b928-7558-11e4-b1bf-00144feabdc0 |title=Lunch with the FT: Donald Tusk |first=Henry |last=Foy |publisher=The Financial Times Ltd |date=28 November 2014 |accessdate=7 February 2019}}</ref>

==2005 Polish presidential election==

{{main|2005 Polish presidential election}}

In the shade of the upcoming expiration of President [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]]'s second term and his inability to stand for a third term, Tusk and [[Lech Kaczyński]] were the leading candidates for the presidential elections. Although both leading candidates came from the centre-right, and their two parties had planned to form a coalition government following the [[2005 Polish parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] on 25 September, there were important differences between Tusk and Kaczyński. Tusk wants to enforce a [[separation of church and state]], favours rapid [[European integration]] and supported a [[free-market economy]]. Kaczyński was very [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]], a [[Soft Euroscepticism|soft Eurosceptic]], and supports [[state interventionism]]. Such differences led to the failure of [[POPiS]] coalition talks in late October. [[Jacek Protasiewicz]] headed his electoral campaign staff. Tusk's campaign motto was ''President Tusk - A man with principles; We will be proud of Poland''. In the election, Tusk received 36.6% of votes in the first round and then faced Kaczyński, who got 33.1% of votes in the first round.

In the second round, Tusk was defeated by Lech Kaczyński.

Tusk and his Civic Platform party emerged victorious in the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election]], defeating incumbent Prime Minister [[Jarosław Kaczyński]]'s Law and Justice party with about 42% of the vote to Law and Justice's 32%.<ref name="reuters 2007">{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-election-idUSL1622600520071021 | title=Poland's Kaczynskis lose election | publisher=Reuters | date=21 October 2007 | accessdate=10 March 2017}}</ref> Tusk and his assembled cabinet were sworn in on 16 November, as he became the fourteenth prime minister of the [[Third Polish Republic]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.pl/national/?id=69544 |publisher=[[Polskie Radio]] |title=Tusk takes over as PM |date=16 October 2007 |accessdate=5 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002053309/http://www.thenews.pl/national/?id=69544 |archive-date=2 October 2011}}</ref>

In the [[2011 Polish parliamentary election]], Civic Platform retained their Parliamentary majority, giving Tusk a second term as Prime Minister and making him Poland's first PM to win reelection since the fall of communism.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2011/1011/Poland-election-In-historic-first-PM-gets-a-second-term | title=Poland election: In historic first, PM gets a second term | newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor | date=11 October 2011 | accessdate=10 March 2017}}</ref> In September 2014, leaders of the [[European Union]] voted unanimously by selecting Tusk as [[Herman van Rompuy]]'s successor for [[President of the European Council]], which gave Poland its first European leadership position since the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]].

===Domestic policy===
During the 2007 parliamentary election campaign and initially when he entered office, Tusk promised to continue the [[free market]] policies, streamline the bureaucracy, enact long-term stable governance, cut taxes to attract greater foreign business ventures, encourage Polish citizens living overseas to return to Poland, and privatise state-owned companies.<ref name=time>{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1729145-1,00.html |accessdate=5 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928000209/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1729145-1%2C00.html |title=Remaking Poland |date=8 September 2008 |work=Time |archive-date=28 September 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref> Later in office, Tusk changed his views on the role of taxation in the functioning of the state and his government never cut any taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://natemat.pl/100997,tusk-kiedys-chcial-obnizac-podatki |work=natemat.pl |title=Tusk przeprasza za to, że chciał obniżać podatki.

Tusk is moderately conservative on social issues.

===Foreign policy===

In foreign policy, Tusk sought to improve relations severely damaged during the previous [[Jarosław Kaczyński|Kaczyński]] government, particularly with Germany and Russia. While he criticised the words of German politician [[Erika Steinbach]] with regard to her opinion over the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expulsion of Germans from Poland]] following World War II, Tusk has stressed the need for warm relations with Berlin.<ref name=spiegel>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/spiegel-interview-with-donald-tusk-polish-pm-calls-for-unified-european-crisis-strategy-a-610726.html |work=Der Spiegel |title=Polish PM Calls for Unified European Crisis Strategy |date=2 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620015105/http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/spiegel-interview-with-donald-tusk-polish-pm-calls-for-unified-european-crisis-strategy-a-610726.html |archive-date=20 June 2012 |url-status=live |accessdate=5 April 2010 |df=dmy}}</ref> Tusk also advocated a more realistic relationship with Moscow, especially in regard to energy policy.<ref name=spiegel/> Under Tusk's premiership, Russian bans on Polish meat and agricultural products were lifted, while Poland reversed its official policy of disagreement on a European Union-Russian partnership agreement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7562258.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Deal cools Polish-Russian relations |date=15 August 2008 |accessdate=5 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403230643/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7562258.stm |archive-date=3 April 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref>

During a speech delivered to the Sejm in the first weeks of his premiership, Tusk outlined a proposal to withdraw [[Polish Land Forces|military units]] from [[Iraq]], stating that "we will conduct this operation keeping in mind that our commitment to our ally, the United States, has been lived up to and exceeded."<ref name=b92>{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/world-article.php?yyyy=2007&mm=11&dd=24&nav_id=45669 |work=B92 |title=Poland to withdraw troops from Iraq |date=24 November 2007 |accessdate=5 April 2010 |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606123852/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/world-article.php?yyyy=2007&mm=11&dd=24&nav_id=45669 |df=dmy}}</ref> The last Polish military units completed their withdrawal in October 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Polish_Close_Iraq_Mission/1293972.html |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Free Europe]] |title=Polish military marks close of Iraq mission |date=10 April 2008 |accessdate=5 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605060733/http://www.rferl.org/content/Polish_Close_Iraq_Mission/1293972.html |archive-date=5 June 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref>

In regards to U.S. plans of hosting [[Missile defense systems by country|missile defense shield]] bases in the country, Tusk hinted skepticism toward the project, saying that their presence could potentially increase security risks from Russia, and rejected U.S. offers in early July 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7490146.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Poland holds out over US missiles |date=7 April 2008 |accessdate=5 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914000053/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7490146.stm |archive-date=14 September 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref> By August, however, Tusk relented, and supported the missile shield, declaring: "We have achieved the main goal.

Contrary to the condemnation of foreign governments and the leadership of the [[European Union]], Tusk supported Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] in his efforts of implementing a new controversial [[Constitution of Hungary|constitution]]. Tusk stated that the Hungarian constitution's democratic controversies were "exaggerated" and that Hungary had "a European level standard of democracy".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/83652,PM-Tusk-defends-Orban-amid-EU-crisis-talks- |publisher=Polskie Radio |title=PM Tusk defends Orban amid EU crisis talks |date=18 January 2012 |accessdate=25 January 2012 |archive-date=26 January 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126191715/http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/83652%2CPM-Tusk-defends-Orban-amid-EU-crisis-talks- |df=dmy}}</ref> Tusk's support for the Hungarian government garnered a rare show of solidarity with the opposition [[Law and Justice]], which also publicly displayed support for Orbán's efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/83565,Polish-conservatives-show-solidarity-with-Hungarian-Fidesz |publisher=Polskie Radio |title=Polish conservatives show solidarity with Hungarian Fidesz |date=17 January 2012 |accessdate=25 January 2012 |archive-date=27 January 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127210214/http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/83565%2CPolish-conservatives-show-solidarity-with-Hungarian-Fidesz |df=dmy}}</ref>

In early 2012, Tusk announced his support for committing Poland to signing the international [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement]] (ACTA). In response, websites for the [[Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland|Chancellery]], [[Sejm]] and [[President of Poland|Presidency]] were hacked in mid-January.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16686265 |publisher=BBC News |title=Polish sites hit in Acta hack attack |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=25 January 2012 |archive-date=24 January 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124075521/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16686265 |df=dmy}}</ref> Following [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]'s claim of responsibility for the web attack, Tusk remained undeterred by internet protests, authorising the Polish ambassador in Japan to sign the agreement, yet promised that final legislation in the Sejm would not go ahead without assurances regarding freedom to access the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/84150,PM-Tusk-stands-firm-on-ACTA-despite-internet-attacks |publisher=Polskie Radio |title=PM Tusk stands firm on ACTA despite internet attacks |date=24 January 2012 |accessdate=25 January 2012 |archive-date=26 June 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626021837/http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/84150%2CPM-Tusk-stands-firm-on-ACTA-despite-internet-attacks |df=dmy}}</ref> Despite the government's guarantees, mass protests erupted in late January, with demonstrations held in [[Warsaw]], [[Kraków]], [[Wrocław]] and [[Kielce]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/12/Artykul/84286,Poland-signs-ACTA-agreement |publisher=Polskie Radio |title=Poland signs ACTA agreement |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=26 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516062504/http://www.thenews.pl/1/12/Artykul/84286%2CPoland-signs-ACTA-agreement |archive-date=16 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16735219 |publisher=BBC News |title=Thousands march in Poland over Acta internet treaty |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=26 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126110531/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16735219 |archive-date=26 January 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref> Further web attacks were reported on the website of Foreign Minister [[Radosław Sikorski|Radek Sikorski]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/84219,Anonymous-hacks-foreign-ministers-web-site |publisher=Polskie Radio |title=Anonymous hacks foreign minister's web site |date=25 January 2012 |accessdate=26 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128013909/http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/84219%2CAnonymous-hacks-foreign-ministers-web-site |archive-date=28 January 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref>

In continental policy, Tusk strongly supported greater political and economic integration within the [[European Union]], strongly backing the implementation of the [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon Treaty]], standing in stark contrast to President [[Lech Kaczyński]]'s vehement opposition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7483370.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Poland poses latest problem for EU |date=7 January 2008 |accessdate=5 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601133629/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7483370.stm |archive-date=1 June 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref> Tusk repeatedly stated his government's intention in bringing Poland into the [[Eurozone]].

Between July and December 2011, Poland under Tusk's government presided over the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pl2011.eu/en/content/half-year-polish-presidency-figures|publisher=Council of the European Union|title=Half-year Polish Presidency in figures|date=28 December 2011|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> Under its presidency tenure, Poland supported and welcomed [[Croatia]]'s entry into the [[European Union]] through the [[Treaty of Accession 2011]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.pl/9/7/Artykul/80187,Croatia-signs-EU-treaty |publisher=Polskie Radio |title=Croatia signs EU treaty |date=9 December 2011 |accessdate=25 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109162231/http://www.thenews.pl/9/7/Artykul/80187%2CCroatia-signs-EU-treaty |archive-date=9 November 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref>

While being a constituent member of the [[Weimar Triangle]] with fellow states Germany and France, Tusk showed displeasure over German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]'s and French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]'s dominating roles in eurozone negotiations, remarking to Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' in January 2012 that "this should not translate into a lasting political monopoly: things cannot be left to only two capitals of Europe."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/12/Artykul/83696,Tusk-Dont-leave-crisis-to-Paris-and-Berlin |publisher=Polskie Radio |title=Tusk – Don't leave crisis to Paris and Berlin |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=25 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122132216/http://www.thenews.pl/1/12/Artykul/83696%2CTusk-Dont-leave-crisis-to-Paris-and-Berlin |archive-date=22 January 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref>

===Constitutional reform===

After being elected prime minister, relations between Tusk and President [[Lech Kaczyński]] were often acrimonious due to different political ideologies and the constitutional role of the presidency. Using presidential veto powers, Kaczyński blocked legislation drafted by the Tusk government, including pension reform, agricultural and urban zoning plans, and restructuring state television.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/poland/090127/polish-president-prime-minister-at-loggerheads |first=Jan |last=Cienski |work=Global Post |title=Polish president, prime minister at loggerheads |date=27 January 2009 |accessdate=5 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705130710/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/poland/090127/polish-president-prime-minister-at-loggerheads |archive-date=5 July 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref>

In his premiership, Tusk has proposed various reforms to the [[Constitution of Poland|Polish constitution]]. In 2009, Tusk proposed changes to the power of the [[President of Poland|presidency]], by abolishing the presidential veto. "The president should not have veto power. People make their decision in elections and then state institutions should not be in conflict," said Tusk.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/11/22/idINIndia-44148520091122 |first=Gabriela |last=Baczynska |agency=Reuters |date=22 November 2009 |title=Polish PM says president should lose veto power |accessdate=28 September 2014 |archive-date=6 March 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306105734/http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/11/22/idINIndia-44148520091122 |df=dmy}}</ref> Tusk again reiterated his desire for constitutional reform in February 2010, proposing that the presidential veto be overridden by a simple parliamentary majority rather than through a three-fifths vote. "Presidential veto could not effectively block the will of the majority in parliament, which won elections and formed the government," stated Tusk.<ref name=platform>{{cite web|language=pl |title=Proponujemy zmiany w konstytucji |url=http://www.krzakala.pl/print/294 |publisher=krzakala.pl |date=10 February 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224080930/http://www.krzakala.pl/print/294 |archive-date=24 February 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref> Further constitutional reforms proposed by Tusk include reducing the [[Sejm]] from a membership of 460 to 300, "not only because of its savings, but also the excessive number of members' causes blurring certain plans and projects".<ref name=platform/> Similarly, Tusk proposed radical changes to the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]], preferring to abolish the [[upper house]] altogether, yet due to constitutional concerns and demands from the junior coalition [[Polish People's Party]] partner, Tusk proposed reducing the Senate from 100 to 49, while including former presidents to sit in the Senate for political experience and expertise in state matters.<ref name=platform/> Parliamentary immunity for all members of the Sejm and Senate would also be stripped, except for in special situations.<ref name=platform/> In addition, Tusk proposed that the prime minister's role in foreign policy decisions would be greatly expanded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.platforma.org/en/about-civic-platform/art762,polands-pm-proposes-constitutional-changes.html|publisher=Civic Platform|title=Poland's PM proposes constitutional changes|date=15 February 2010|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> By decreasing the president's role in governance, executive power would further be concentrated in the prime minister, directly responsible to the [[First Cabinet of Donald Tusk|cabinet]] and Sejm, as well as avoiding confusion over Poland's representation at international or EU summits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.polskieradio.pl/eo/print.aspx?iid=125258 |publisher=Polskie Radio |title=Civic Platform overhauling the constitution |date=2 September 2010 |accessdate=5 April 2010 |archive-date=16 May 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516063757/http://www2.polskieradio.pl/eo/print.aspx?iid=125258 |df=dmy}}</ref> The opposition conservative [[Law and Justice]] party deeply criticised Tusk's constitutional reform proposals, opting in opposing legislation for the presidency to garner greater power over the prime minister.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www2.polskieradio.pl/eo/print.aspx?iid=123742 |publisher=Polskie Radio |title=Battle over the Constitution |date=15 January 2010 |accessdate=5 April 2010 |archive-date=5 October 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005030652/http://www2.polskieradio.pl/eo/print.aspx?iid=123742 |df=dmy}}</ref>

In an interview with the ''[[Financial Times]]'' in January 2010, Tusk was asked if he considered running again as [[Civic Platform]]'s candidate for that year's [[2010 Polish presidential election|presidential election]]. Tusk replied that although the presidential election typically drew the most voters to the polls and remained Poland's most high-profiled race, the presidency had little political power outside of the veto, and preferred to remain as prime minister. While not formally excluding his candidacy, Tusk declared that "I would very much like to continue to work in the government and Civic Platform, because that seems to me to be the key element in ensuring success in the civilisational race in which we are engaged."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9ad8793a-0b74-11df-8232-00144feabdc0.html|work=[[Financial Times]]|title=FT interview transcript: Donald Tusk|date=27 January 2010|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref> A day after the interview, Tusk formally announced his intention of staying as prime minister, allowing his party to choose another candidate (and eventual winner), [[Bronisław Komorowski]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.pl/national/?id=124537 |work=Polskie Radio |title=Tusk not running in 2010 presidential election |date=28 January 2010 |accessdate=5 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005030801/http://www.thenews.pl/national/?id=124537 |archive-date=5 October 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}</ref>

===Honors and awards===
The [[Charlemagne Prize]] of the city of [[Aachen]] was awarded to Tusk on 13 May 2010 for his merits in the further unification of Europe and for his role as a "patriot and great European".

Tusk's religious views became a matter of a debate during his presidential campaign in 2005. To avoid further speculation, just before the presidential elections Tusk requested a Catholic marriage ceremony with his wife Małgorzata, whom he had married in a civil ceremony 27 years earlier.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kobieta.onet.pl/slub/ks-dariusz-oko-ws-slubu-donalda-tuska-trzeba-miec-szczere-intencje-by-byl-wazny/xyj2g|title=Ks.
