== History ==
A daily newspaper with this title was issued for the first time in 1920 as a medium of the conservative Christian National Party. It was Initially owned by its founder [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] and after 1924 by [[Wojciech Korfanty]], two prominent politicians of that time. The editor-in-chief [[Stanisław Stroński]] sought to maintain quality of the content by cooperating with a group of authors, including  Adolf Nowaczyński, [[Kornel Makuszyński]], and [[Władysław Witwicki]]. The last issue of ''Rzeczpospolita'' in the Second Polish Republic appeared on the last day of 1931.

During the war (1940–1943), an irregular paper associated with one of the Polish resistance groups – Polish People's Independence Action – was issued under the same title.

In 1944 an administration dependent on the [[Soviet Union]] started activities behind the lines of the [[Red Army]], within the territory of Poland. Initially the activity was directed only against former [[Nazi]] German forces, in order to gain the favour of Polish society.

On 23 July 1944, when the war had not been over yet, the first issue of ''Rzeczpospolita'' – the newspaper of the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] – was published in Chełm. The editor-in-chief was [[Jerzy Borejsza]], a communist activist and journalist in the interwar years, who after the outbreak of war collaborated with the Russians before they entered Polish territory. His articles in ''Rzeczpospolita'' presented the opinions in line with the position of the Kremlin. The newspaper began strenuous endeavours as to form a positive image of the new government. The [[Home Army]] commanders and their decision to commence the [[Warsaw Uprising]] were criticised, while [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] and [[land reform]] were supported.

After the war, ''Rzeczpospolita'' was issued by "Czytelnik" cooperative publishing house, whose president was Borejsza himself. He delegated the editorial duties to Paweł Hoffman, who soon changed the title to ''Rzeczpospolita. Dziennik Gospodarczy'', later changing it again to ''Rzeczpospolita. Dziennik Polityczno-Gospodarczy''. In 1949, the editor-in-chief was Henryk Korotyński, and newspaper joined the campaign against the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1949, the state authorities had established another newspaper – ''People's Tribune'' ({{lang-pl|[[Trybuna Ludu]]}}) as an organ of a newly formed political party, the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (colloquially: party). ''Rzeczpospolita'' had been issued still by nearly two years, until the beginning of 1951, when it was discontinued because coexistence of the party and government newspapers was considered at that time unfavorable for a consolidated [[one-party state]]. Part of the team joined ''Głos Pracy'', while several journalists, including Korotyński, moved to ''Życie Warszawy''.

In 1980 the state had faced a crisis, and consequently the party's overall image deteriorated significantly. This prompted the idea to relaunch a separate government newspaper. In the spring of 1981, thus during the rise of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], [[Edmund Osmańczyk]], member of parliament of the [[Polish People's Republic|Polish People’s Republic]], proposed to revive ''Rzeczpospolita'' as a "governmental medium presenting the position of the state on a daily basis”. Józef Barecki, former editor of ''Trybuna Ludu,'' a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and of the parliament, as well as a government spokesman for a year, was appointed as the editor-in-chief. The first issue of the new ''Rzeczpospolita'' appeared during the martial law, on 14 January 1982.

The state, as an entity, had become officially independent from the party (even though this independence was still largely fictitious within a communist state). Thus, from 1982 onwards, ''Rzeczpospolita'' and ''Trybuna Ludu'' resumed their parallel existence as the official bulletins of the government and the party apparatus respectively. This dualism corresponded to the situation in the Soviet Union, where the government newspaper ''[[Izvestia]]'' functioned alongside the party's ''[[Pravda]]'', and where Izvestia has steered a course strikingly similar to ''Rzeczpospolita'' in the 1990s.

After the partially free elections of 4 June 1989 and after [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] became Prime Minister, the management of the newspaper changed as well. ''Rzeczpospolita'' was no longer a government medium and became an independent newspaper. Its new editor-in-chief was Dariusz Fikus (until 1996).

The new Polish government made ''Rzeczpospolita'' legitimately independent. In February 1991, Państwowe Przedsiębiorstwo Wydawnicze "Rzeczpospolita", a state publishing company, with Maciej Cegłowski as the new CEO, together with the French Robert Hersant press group, Presse Participations Europennes, established Presspublica company. Its first CEO was the then editor-in-chief of ''Rzeczpospolita,'' Dariusz Fikus. Initially, the Polish shareholder held 51% of company shares, while the French owned 49%. In 1993, ''Rzeczpospolita'' was named the Newspaper of the Year by the Pheidippides Committee.

In the mid-1990s, the Polish party sold the additional 2% of shares to the French. In 1996, the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Orkla Media]] corporation acquired shares held by the Robert Hersant group. During the next 10 years, 51% of shares were held by the subsidiary of Orkla Press Polska, Presspublica Holding Norway, while 49% belonged to Państwowe Przedsiębiorstwo Wydawnicze "Rzeczpospolita" (from 1 March 2000, to Przedsiębiorstwo Wydawnicze “Rzeczpospolita” SA). In October 2006, the shares of Orkla Press Polska were taken over by Mecom Poland Holdings SA forming part of the British Mecom Group.

In October 2011 Gremi Media, owned by the Polish entrepreneur Grzegorz Hajdarowicz, purchased the shares from Mecom Poland<ref name="ftimes">{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/843a1b14-fe22-11e0-bac4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3KkLAjCfT |title=Grzegorz Hajdarowicz: Press owner puts his faith in new media |date=1 November 2011 |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |location=London, UK |first=Kamil |last=Tchorek |accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref> and the shares belonging to PW Rzeczpospolita (the State Treasury), becoming a 100% shareholder of Presspublica publishing house. The publishing house changed its name to Gremi Media, after which, in January 2017, it was transformed into a joint stock company operating under the business name of Gremi Media SA.

In the nearest future we will introduce all release of our media in version for tablet, and expand and enrich the online edition. Just such will be ''Rzeczpospolita''. Conservatively minded, innovative in action and of open spirit. This is merely an extension of credo of the former chief editor Dariusz Fikus – modern and reliable. We will abide by these principles. |accessdate=18 September 2012}}</ref>
