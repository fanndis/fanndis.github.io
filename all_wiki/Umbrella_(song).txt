"'''Umbrella'''" is a song by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]] from her third studio album ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad]]'' (2007). It features American rapper [[Jay-Z]], who co-wrote the song with its producers [[Tricky Stewart]] and [[Kuk Harrell]], with additional writing from [[The-Dream]]. The song was originally written with [[Britney Spears]] in mind, but her label rejected it. "Umbrella" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song with [[Rock music|rock]] elements, referring to a romantic and platonic relationship and the strength of that relationship.

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked the song number one on the 10 Best Singles of 2007, while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' listed the song at number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007. The song has earned Rihanna several awards and nominations. In 2007, the song won two awards at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], when it was nominated for four. At the [[2008 Grammy Awards]], "Umbrella" also earned Rihanna and Jay-Z a [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] in addition to receiving nominations for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]. The song is also listed at No. 412 on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s "[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]".

The song serves as the [[lead single]] to the album, and was released worldwide on March 29, 2007 through [[Def Jam Recordings]]. "Umbrella" was a commercial success, topping the charts in Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In the United Kingdom, where the song's chart performance coincided with the [[2007 United Kingdom floods|prolonged rain and flooding]], it was one of the most played songs on [[radio]] in the 2000s decade. It managed to stay at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] for 10 consecutive weeks, the longest run at number one for any single of that decade, and is also one of the few songs to top the chart for at least 10 weeks. The single was one of the highest digital debuts in the United States at the time and remained at the top of the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] for seven consecutive weeks.

The single's accompanying music video was directed by Chris Applebaum and features, among all, Rihanna's nude body covered in silver paint. The video earned Rihanna a [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]] and Most Watched Video on MuchMusic.com at [[MuchMusic Video Awards]]. Along with countless amateurs, "Umbrella" has been covered by several notable performers from a variety of musical genres, including [[All Time Low]], the [[The Baseballs|Baseballs]], [[Biffy Clyro]], [[Manic Street Preachers]], [[McFly]], [[Mike Shinoda]] of [[Linkin Park]], [[OneRepublic]], [[Taylor Swift]], and [[Vanilla Sky (band)|Vanilla Sky]]. Rihanna performed the song at the [[2007 MTV Movie Awards]], [[2008 BRIT Awards]] and was the closing song of the [[Good Girl Gone Bad Tour]] (2008), the [[Last Girl on Earth]] (2010), and the [[Loud Tour]] (2011). It was included in the [[Diamonds World Tour]] (2013), and the [[Anti World Tour]] (2016). "Umbrella" is also a playable song in the 2012 video game ''[[Just Dance 4]]''.

==Background==
American songwriter and producer [[Christopher Stewart (music producer)|Christopher "Tricky" Stewart]] convened with [[The-Dream|Terius "The-Dream" Nash]] and [[Kuk Harrell]] in January 2007 at the [[Atlanta]]-based Triangle Studios to create new material. In the studio, Stewart was "messing around with a walloping [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] sound", which he found in the free music software [[GarageBand]], which is included in all [[Mac computer]]s. With his attention caught by the sound, Nash asked Stewart what he was doing: "Oh, my Gosh, what is that beat?". When Stewart incorporated [[chord (music)|chord]]s onto the hi-hat, "immediately the word popped into [Nash's] head"; he went to the vocal booth and started singing.<ref name="RosenPoll">{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/ReadersPoll2007/articles/10452.aspx |title=Readers' Poll 2007 |last=Rosen |first=Jody |date=2007-12-25 |work=Blender |accessdate=2007-12-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228000652/http://www.blender.com/ReadersPoll2007/articles/10452.aspx |archivedate=December 28, 2007 }}</ref> Nash wrote the first two verses and the chorus over Stewart's skeleton track.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2009/04/20/090420crmu_music_frerejones|title=Living on the Radio|last=Frere-Jones|first=Sasha|date=2009-04-20|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=2009-04-14}}</ref> They quickly wrote the lyrics, completing the first verse in 60 seconds. They continued into writing, adding the [[hook (music)|hook]] while "[Stewart] would put the next chord". In a matter of hours, they had recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo]] of the track.<ref name="RosenPoll"/> The song was written with American pop singer [[Britney Spears]] in mind, whom Stewart had previously worked with on her 2003 single "[[Me Against the Music]]". Stewart and Nash thought that Spears, who had "her personal life&nbsp;... a little out of control" at the time, needed a hit as a musical comeback.<ref name="RosenPoll"/> Spears was working on her fifth album, ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'', so they sent a copy of the demo to Spears' management. However, Spears did not hear of the song because her label rejected it, claiming they had enough songs for her to record.<ref name="Rodriguez">{{Cite news|last=Rodriguez|first=Jayson|title=Rihanna's 'Umbrella' Was 'The Perfect Storm' That Almost Didn't Happen: Behind The Grammys|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1580820/20080201/rihanna.jhtml|publisher=MTV News. Viacom|date=February 6, 2007|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}</ref>

Following the management's rejection of the track, Stewart and Nash dealt it out to other record labels. It was also given to British singer-songwriter [[Taio Cruz]], who failed to convince his record company to release it.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3672106/Taio-Cruz-the-public-school-soul-sensation.html | location=London | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | first=Neil | last=McCormick | title=Taio Cruz: the public school soul sensation | date=2008-03-27}}</ref> It was then opted by [[The Island Def Jam Music Group|Island Def Jam]] chairman [[L.A. Reid|Antonio "L.A." Reid]], a friend of Stewart who established his first studio. By early February 2007, the demo was sent to Reid's right-hand woman, [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] executive Karen Kwak, who passed it along to Reid with a message confirming that they had found a song suited for Rihanna, who was working on her third studio album, ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad]]'', at the time. Reid immediately sent the demo to Rihanna, who was also positive of it: "When the demo first started playing, I was like, This is interesting, this is weird.&nbsp;... But the song kept getting better. I listened to it over and over. I said, 'I need this record. I want to record it tomorrow."<ref name="RosenPoll"/>

However, since it was the [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] season of 2007, Stewart and Nash eyed American R&B singer [[Mary J. Blige]] for the demo.<ref name="Rodriguez"/> Upon calling them to set the record aside for Rihanna, Stewart had played it to an associate of Blige, subsequently promising the song to her. Having heard the move of the writers, Kwak began calling Stewart and his manager, Mark Stewart, incessantly. Meanwhile, considering Blige's nominations at the Grammys, Stewart and Nash agreed to wait for her response. However, Blige failed to hear the song in full due to her obligations to the Grammys at the time and "had to sign off on the record before her reps could accept it".<ref name="Rodriguez"/><ref>{{Cite news|last=Rodriguez|first=Jayson |title=Mary J. Blige Says She's 'Just Fine' With Her New Album, Losing 'Umbrella' To Rihanna|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1571625/20071010/blige_mary_j.jhtml|publisher=MTV|date=2007-10-23|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> Finally, Reid "stepped in, trading on his power-broker status and longstanding relationship with Stewart", and admits, "I made the producers an offer they couldn't refuse."<ref name="RosenPoll"/> By the time Reid had successfully persuaded Stewart's camp, they "just couldn't say no".<ref name="Rodriguez"/> On giving up the record to Reid's camp, Mark Stewart comments, "We knew Rihanna's album would be out in a few months. Mary wasn't even in an album cycle yet. We made the sensible business decision."<ref name="RosenPoll"/>

Rihanna recorded the song, with vocal production by [[Kuk Harrell|Thaddis "Kuk" Harrell]], in a [[Westlake Recording Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Initially, Stewart admitted he was still reluctant as to whether Rihanna was the right artist to record the song, but following the recording of the "ella, ella" [[catch phrase]], he felt they were onto "something".<ref name="Rodriguez"/> Following Rihanna's recording, Def Jam CEO-rapper [[Jay-Z]] added his [[rapping|rap]]. However, Jay-Z rewrote his verse without the awareness of Stewart and Nash. Stewart could not understand it, but later realized it made "sense" instead of the first version. Stewart noted that "from a songwriter's standpoint, he just really made it more about the song, with the metaphors about umbrellas and about the weather versus what he had before".<ref name="Rodriguez"/>

==Critical reception==
"Umbrella" received critical acclaim from music critics. Andy Kellman of [[AllMusic]] commented: "'Umbrella' is [Rihanna's best song] to date, delivering mammoth if spacious drums, a towering backdrop during the chorus, and vocals that are somehow totally convincing without sounding all that impassioned – an ideal spot between trying too hard and boredom, like she might've been on her 20th take."<ref>{{cite web |last=Kellman |first=Andy |title=Review: Good Girl Gone Bad |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1059455|pure_url=yes}} |website=AllMusic |accessdate=2008-02-13}}</ref> Alex Macpherson of British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', "Umbrella" is "evidence" that Rihanna's "strict work ethic is paying off", adding that she "delivers [in the song] an impassioned declaration of us-against-the-world devotion".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/01/popandrock.shopping3|title=Rihanna, Good Girl Gone Bad|last=Macpherson|first=Alex|date=2007-06-01|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-11-27 | location=London}}</ref> Tom Breihan of [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']], though he complimented the production, dismissed Rihanna's voice which "takes on an unpleasant icepick edge when she tries to fill the space between the slow-tempo beats", adding that the song is "uncompelling as event-pop, particularly because of the disconnect between Rihanna's cold, clinical delivery and the comforting warmth of the lyrics".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/43487-good-girl-gone-bad |title=Rihanna: Good Girl Gone Bad |last=Breihan |first=Tom |date=2007-06-15 |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=2008-11-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210010504/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/43487-good-girl-gone-bad |archivedate=December 10, 2008 }}</ref>

==Music video==
===Background and concept===
While working on the album, ideas began to circulate concerning Rihanna's image, extending into her music videos. She asked American music video director Chris Applebaum to send her "something" to work on. Def Jam representatives were expecting Applebaum of the treatment.<ref name="Rodriguez2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1568860/20070904/rihanna.jhtml|title=Rihanna's 'Painful' 'Umbrella' Shoot Kept Her On Her Toes: VMA Lens Recap|last=Rodriguez|first=Jayson|publisher=MTV|date=2007-09-05|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> In response, Applebaum hurriedly made a [[film treatment|treatment]] for the video, one of his first ideas being the silver body paint that Rihanna is seen in. Applebaum was doubtful whether Rihanna would embrace the idea, but her "positive response" following a letter the director sent to the artist ensured its approval. Makeup artist Pamela Neal mixed a silver paint that would give Rihanna such a look. During the session, the paint was re-applied between takes to ensure she was completely covered. The set was closed to Rihanna, Applebaum and a camera assistant.<ref name="Rodriguez2"/> Rihanna also contributed her own ideas towards the video shoot, suggesting to Applebaum that she dance [[en pointe]], an idea which he accepted.<ref name="Rodriguez2"/>

Visual effects at Kroma were supervised by Bert Yukich and produced by Amy Yukich.<ref name="KromaInterview">{{Cite news|url=http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2007/rihanna-umbrella|title=Rihanna Umbrella in Music Video (The Inspiration Room)|work=KromA|date=2007-09-06|accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> A key part of the video is a 24-second visual effects sequence in which Rihanna is surrounded by silvery strands of liquid that crisscross the frame in graceful arcs in response to her movements. Water elements were recorded on a special effects stage using a high-speed 35mm camera. Bert Yukich then composited them into the scene with the singer. He then added lighting effects to the practical water elements to give them the mirror-like texture of mercury.

===Release===
The music video premiered on April 26, 2007 on her website. Downloads were made available for those in the U.S. only from the website for a limited time. The video was officially released on the [[iTunes Store]] on May 11, 2007, peaking at number one for a period of eight weeks. On May 1, 2007, "Umbrella" debuted on MTV's ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' at number ten, before reaching number one on May 9 where it remained for fifteen days, making it the longest running number one of 2007.

"Umbrella" is widely acknowledged as the song that propelled Rihanna from rising pop act into superstardom and transformed her into a "fully fledged sex symbol" and a pop icon, with some music journalists considering it to be her [[signature song]].<ref name="Rihanna Vibe">{{cite web|last1=Gracie|first1=Bianca|title=Rihanna's 'Good Girl Gone Bad' Turns 10: Crafting A Rule-Breaking Pop Culture Icon|url=https://www.vibe.com/2017/06/rihanna-good-girl-gone-bad-10-year-anniversary/|website=Vibe|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="Rihanna the Guardian">{{cite news|last1=Cartner-Morley|first1=Jess|title=Rihanna: the pop star who became a fashion powerhouse|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/sep/15/rihanna-pop-star-fashion-powerhouse-beauty-brand|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="Rihanna best songs billboard">{{cite magazine|last1=Weiner|first1=Natalie|title=Rihanna's 10 Best Songs|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/6820746/rihanna-songs-best-hits-list|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="Rihanna dazed">{{cite web|last1=Agafonov|first1=Mikhael|title=Ten years ago, 'Umbrella' turned Rihanna into a pop icon|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/35332/1/rihanna-umbrella-10th-anniversary-retrospective|website=Dazed|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="Rihanna Up the Anti">{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Peter|title=Up the Anti: how Rihanna rewrote the rules of pop|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/28/up-the-anti-how-rihanna-rewrote-the-rules-of-pop|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilhite|first1=Matt|title=Ten years later, 'Umbrella' shows a Rihanna that doesn't exist anymore|url=https://fansided.com/2017/03/29/rihanna-umbrella-10-years-later/|website=Fansided|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="Interns">{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Sam|title='Good Girl Gone Bad' Transformed Rihanna From A Popstar To An Icon|url=https://theinterns.net/2017/06/06/good-girl-gone-bad-transformed-rihanna-from-a-popstar-to-an-icon/|website=Interns|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref> "Umbrella" marked the first time Rihanna transitioned from the "[[girl next door]]" persona of her first two albums for an "edgy, sexier" look, which triggered her image evolution for her subsequent albums.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Smith|first1=Da'Shan|title=10 Years After 'Good Girl Gone Bad,' Rihanna Has Surpassed Her Goal of Becoming the 'Black Madonna'|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7809391/rihanna-good-girl-gone-bad-anniversary-black-madonna|magazine=Billboard|accessdate=6 December 2017}}</ref> In his book ''The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory'', [[John Seabrook]] wrote: <blockquote>Two albums into her career, it still wasn't clear who Rihanna was. To her detractors, and there were many, she was just another wannabe-[[Beyoncé|yoncé]] who sang through her nose and couldn't really dance. To prove them wrong, she needed a song that would define her as an artist. [...] Eleven rhythmic syllables, "umbrella-ella-ella-eh-eh-eh," did what the two previous albums together had not done: they defined Rihanna as an artist. [...] "Umbrella" marked the arrival of something new in pop: a digital icon. In the rock era, when the album was the standard unit of recorded music, listeners had ten or twelve songs to get to know the artist, but in the singles-oriented world of today, the artist has only three or four minutes to put their personality across, and at that Rihanna would prove to be without peer.<ref name="John Seabrook Book">{{cite book|last1=Seabrook|first1=John|title=The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory|date=2016|publisher=W.

[...] Nothing has been the same since we created that record. We had experience in record making but not hit making. All of a sudden you have major artists blowing up your phone. And we knew exactly how to service them; we reverted back to that jingle mentality — we were prepared for that pressure. So whether it was Beyoncé calling or Bieber calling, we knew how to operate. [...] When she recorded the 'ellas', you knew your life was about to change."<ref name="Spin John Seabrook book" /> In January 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named "Umbrella" as Rihanna's best song.<ref name="Rihanna best songs billboard" /> In 2018, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' identified "Umbrella" as Rihanna's second greatest song of her career, behind "[[We Found Love]]" (2011) and stated that "Umbrella" transformed Rihanna into a "full-fledged pop heavyweight".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dolan|first1=Jon|title=Rihanna's 30 Greatest Songs, Ranked|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/rihannas-30-greatest-songs-ranked-w516720|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=21 February 2018}}</ref> In the same year, ''[[The Guardian]]'' named "Umbrella" as the best song to spend over 10 weeks at number one in the UK, writing that "Rihanna's Umbrella is a genuinely exceptional pop song.

==="Rihanna Curse"===
"Umbrella"'s reign at number one in the United Kingdom occurred as the country was hit by [[2007 United Kingdom floods|extreme rainfall and flooding]], which led the British national newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' to humorously suggest the two events were related, with the media referring to it as the "Rihanna Curse." A similar situation occurred in New Zealand, where the song hit number one in the early winter of 2007 as the country was experiencing some of the worst storms in its history.<ref name="NZCurse">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/music/news/article.cfm?c_id=264&objectid=10452521|title=Rain curse of Rihanna's Umbrella|date=2007-07-19|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=2008-11-09}}</ref> During the weather conditions, [[Taranaki Region|Taranaki]], [[Tauranga]], and [[Auckland]] had experienced tornadoes and flooding in the [[Far North District|Far North]] of the country. Once the single was replaced on the top spot, weather conditions throughout New Zealand pacified, although [[Hawke's Bay Region|Hawke's Bay]] was still stormy.<ref name="NZCurse"/>

The same happened in [[Romania]] where "Umbrella" hit the stations in the nation during the summer. That summer was in its first half the hottest and driest period of time in Romania since 1946.<ref name="romania">{{cite news|author=Viorica Dima, Ortansa Jude|title=Use of ECMWF products in forecasting severe weather events in Romania|work=Forecast Products Users Meeting|publisher=Reading|year=2008}}</ref> As the song reached the top ten and then its number-one peak, the country experienced the worst storms and most pouring rains in its history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Temperaturi extreme in Romania in 2007|url=http://vremea.meteoromania.ro/taxonomy/term/206|work=ANM|publisher=meteoromania.ro|date=November 2007|accessdate=2011-06-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901194609/http://vremea.meteoromania.ro/taxonomy/term/206|archivedate=2011-09-01}}</ref> As the song was losing positions in the charts, the storm ended and the temperatures lowered step-by-step.<ref name="romania"/>

With the record-breaking success of the single and the reported coincidence with the weather, Def Jam's marketing team collaborated with British umbrella manufacturer [[Totes Isotoner|Totes]]. The company produced five types of Rihanna umbrellas, one of which was a two-tone satin umbrella that Rihanna debuted in public during her performance of the song at the [[2007 MTV Movie Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thebaglady.tv/2007/07/rihannas_umbere.html|title=Rihanna's Umbrella ella ella eh eh eh|last=Laura|date=2007-07-24|publisher=The Bag Lady|accessdate=2008-11-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008043052/http://www.thebaglady.tv/2007/07/rihannas_umbere.html|archivedate=2008-10-08}}</ref> Although manufactured by a UK-based company, the collection was made available only to US residents online through the company's website.{{cn|date=April 2020}}
