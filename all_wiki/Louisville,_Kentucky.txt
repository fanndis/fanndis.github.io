==History==

{{Main|History of Louisville, Kentucky|Timeline of Louisville, Kentucky}}
{{See also|History of Kentucky|National Register of Historic Places listings in Jefferson County, Kentucky}}

The history of Louisville spans hundreds of years, and has been influenced by the area's [[#Geography|geography]] and location.

===Early history and founding===

[[File:George Rogers Clark.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|alt=Painting of the head and shoulders of an older, gray-haired, balding man in a colonial-era military uniform (blue jacket with white lapels and gold epaullettes)|Louisville's founder, [[George Rogers Clark]]]]

The rapids at the [[Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area|Falls of the Ohio]] created a barrier to river travel, and as a result, settlements grew up at this stopping point. The first European settlement in the vicinity of modern-day Louisville was on [[Corn Island (Kentucky)|Corn Island]] in 1778 by Col. George Rogers Clark, credited as the founder of Louisville. Several landmarks in the community are named after him.<ref>{{cite web|title=George Rogers Clark: Kentucky Frontiersman, Hero, and Founder of Louisville|publisher=Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives|url=http://www.kdla.ky.gov/resources/kygrclark.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070425213827/http://www.kdla.ky.gov/resources/KYGRClark.htm|archive-date=April 25, 2007|access-date=July 19, 2007}}</ref>

Two years later, in 1780, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] approved the town charter of Louisville. The city was named in honor of [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI of France]], whose soldiers were then [[France in the American Revolutionary War|aiding Americans in the Revolutionary War]]. Early residents lived in [[Fort Nelson (Kentucky)|forts]] to protect themselves from Indian raids, but moved out by the late 1780s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Two Hundred Years at the Fall of the Ohio: A History of Louisville and Jefferson County |last=Yater |first=George H. |year=1987 |publisher=[[The Filson Historical Society|Filson Club, Incorporated]] |location=Louisville, Kentucky |edition=2nd |pages=9–10 |isbn = 978-0-9601072-3-0}}</ref> In 1803, explorers [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark]] organized their [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|expedition across America]] in the town of [[Clarksville, Indiana]] at the present-day Falls of the Ohio opposite Louisville, Kentucky.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition|url=http://lewisandclarkjournals.unl.edu/read/?_xmlsrc=introduction.general.xml&_xslsrc=LCstyles.xsl|access-date=July 30, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lewis and Clark—Falls of the Ohio|url=http://www.in.gov/dnr/lewis-clark/falls/|access-date=July 30, 2009}}</ref>

===19th century===

[[File:Louisville 1846.jpg|alt=Artist's rendering of Main Street in Louisville as it appeared in 1846|thumb|right|View of 2nd Street and Main Street, Louisville, in 1846]]

The city's early growth was influenced by the fact that river boats had to be unloaded and moved downriver before reaching the falls. By 1828, the population had grown to 7,000 and Louisville became an incorporated city.<ref>Yater, pp. 46–48.</ref>

Early Louisville was a major shipping port and slaves worked in a variety of associated trades. The city was often a point of escape for slaves to the north, as Indiana was a free state.

During this point in the 1850s, the city was growing and vibrant, but that also came with negativity. It was the center of planning, supplies, recruiting, and transportation for numerous campaigns, especially in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]]. Ethnic tensions rose, and on August 6, 1855, known as "[[Bloody Monday]]", Protestant mobs attacked German and Irish Catholic neighborhoods on election day, resulting in 22 deaths and widespread property damage. Then by 1861, the civil war broke out. [[Louisville, Kentucky, in the American Civil War|During the Civil War]], Louisville was a major stronghold of [[Union Army|Union forces]], which kept Kentucky firmly in the Union. By the end of the war, the city of Louisville itself had not been attacked, although skirmishes and battles, including the battles of [[Battle of Perryville|Perryville]] and [[Battle of Corydon|Corydon]], took place nearby. After Reconstruction, returning [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] veterans largely took political control of the city, leading to the jibe that Louisville joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] after the war was over.
[[File:Churchill Downs 1901.jpg|thumb|right|[[Churchill Downs]] in 1901]]

The first [[Kentucky Derby]] was held on May 17, 1875, at the Louisville Jockey Club track (later renamed [[Churchill Downs]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchilldowns.com/visit/about/churchill-downs/history/|title=History of Churchill Downs {{!}} {{!}} Churchill Downs Racetrack {{!}} Home of the Kentucky Derby|website=churchilldowns.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref> The Derby was originally shepherded by [[Meriwether Lewis Clark, Jr.]], the grandson of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and grandnephew of the city's founder George Rogers Clark. Horse racing had a strong tradition in Kentucky, whose [[Bluegrass region|Inner Bluegrass Region]] had been a center of breeding high-quality livestock throughout the 19th century. Ten thousand spectators watched the first Derby, which [[Aristides (horse)|Aristides]] won.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kentucky Derby Timeline: 1874–1899 |url=http://www.kentuckyderby.com/2009/history/timeline/1874-1899 |access-date=July 30, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410204842/http://www.kentuckyderby.com/2009/history/timeline/1874-1899 |archive-date=April 10, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On March 27, 1890, the city was devastated and its downtown nearly destroyed when an [[Fujita scale|F4]] [[tornado]] tore through as part of the [[March 1890 middle Mississippi Valley tornado outbreak|middle Mississippi Valley tornado outbreak]]. It is estimated that between 74 and 120 people were killed and 200 were injured. The damage cost the city $2.5 million<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/lmk/tornado_climatology_march271890|title=Tornadoes of March 27, 1890|last=US Department of Commerce|first=NOAA|website=weather.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref> (equivalent to $69 million in 2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1890?amount=2500000|title=$2,500,000 in 1890 → 2019 {{!}} Inflation Calculator|website=in2013dollars.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref>

===20th and 21st centuries===

In 1914, the City of Louisville passed a racially-based residential zoning code, following Baltimore, Atlanta, and a handful of cities in the Carolinas.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Residential Segregation by Law, 1910–1917|first=Roger L.|last= Rice|journal=The Journal of Southern History|volume=34|issue=2|date=May 1968|pages=181–183|doi=10.2307/2204656|jstor=2204656}}</ref> The [[NAACP]] challenged the ordinance in two cases. Two weeks after the ordinance enacted, an African-American named Arthur Harris moved into a house on a block designated for whites. He was prosecuted and found guilty. The second case was planned to create a test case. William Warley, the president of the local chapter of the NAACP, tendered a purchase offer on a white block from Charles Buchanan, a white real estate agent. Warley also wrote a letter declaring his intention to build a house on that lot and reside there. With the understanding that the Louisville ordinance made it illegal for him to live there, Warley withheld payment, setting in motion a breach of contract suit by Buchanan.<ref>Rice (1968), pp. 185–186.</ref> By 1917 the US Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]''. The court struck down the Louisville residential segregation ordinance, ruling that it violated the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s [[due process]] clause.<ref>Rice (1968), p. 194.</ref>

In 1917, shortly after the United States' entry into World War 1, Louisville was selected as the site of Camp Zachary Taylor. Camp Taylor was one of the country's largest World War 1 training camps. It was home of the 84th Infantry Division and trained over 150,000 men by the end of war, including F. Scott Fitzgerald. The camp was closed in 1921. Many of the buildings and infrastructure in the Camp Taylor neighborhood of Louisville are there as a result of the training camp. 

In 1929, Louisville completed the [[lock and dam]] in the [[Ohio Falls|Falls of the Ohio]] and the city began referring to itself as "where Northern enterprise and [[Southern hospitality]] meet". Between the industrial boom of that year and through the [[Great Depression]], Louisville gained 15,000 new residents, about three percent of them black, most fleeing poverty in rural areas.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Luther J.|date=Autumn 2001|title=African American Migration to Louisville in the Mid-Twentieth Century|journal=The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society|volume=99|issue=4|pages=363–384|jstor=23384797}}</ref>

The [[flood]] submerged 60–70 percent of the city, caused complete loss of power for four days, and forced the evacuation of 175,000 or 230,000 residents, depending on sources.

Louisville was a center for factory war production during World War II. In May 1942, the U.S. government assigned the [[Curtiss-Wright]] Aircraft Company, a war plant located at Louisville's air field, for wartime aircraft production. The factory produced the [[C-46 Commando]] cargo plane, among other aircraft. In 1946, the factory was sold to [[International Harvester]], which began large-scale production of tractors and agricultural equipment. In 1950, the Census Bureau reported Louisville's population as 84.3% white and 15.6% black.<ref>{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 }}</ref>

Throughout the 1940s, there were more black [[police officer]]s than any other southern city, though they were allowed to patrol only black districts. This lead, in part, made Louisville seem like a more racially progressive city than other southern cities, though only when black citizens accepted a lower status than white citizens. Many historians have referred to this "veil" of segregation as a [[Covert racism|"polite" racism]]. Historian George Wright stating that polite racism "often deluded both blacks and well-meaning whites into believing that real progress was being made in their city". For example, in the city [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] practices were not maintained by law so much as by custom.<ref name=":1" />

Similar to many other older American cities, Louisville began to experience a movement of people and businesses to the suburbs in the 1960s and 1970s. Middle class residents used newly built freeways and interstate highways to commute to work, moving into more distant but newer housing. Because of tax laws, businesses found it cheaper to build new rather than renovate older buildings. Economic changes included a decline in local manufacturing. The West End and older areas of the South End, in particular, began to decline economically as many local factories closed.

Since the 1980s, many of the city's urban neighborhoods have been [[gentrification|revitalized]] into areas popular with young professionals and college students. The greatest change has occurred along the [[The Highlands, Louisville|Bardstown Road/Baxter Avenue]] and [[Clifton, Louisville|Frankfort Avenue]] corridors as well as the [[Old Louisville]] neighborhood.

Louisville is southeasterly situated along the border between Kentucky and [[Indiana]], the [[Ohio River]], in north-central Kentucky at the [[Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area|Falls of the Ohio]]. Although situated in a [[Southern United States|Southern state]], Louisville is influenced by both [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern culture]]. It is sometimes referred to as either one of the northernmost Southern cities or as one of the southernmost Northern cities in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Meyer |first=David R. |date=December 1989 |title=Midwestern Industrialization and the American Manufacturing Belt in the Nineteenth Century |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=921–937 |jstor=2122744 |doi=10.1017/S0022050700009505 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.emporis.com/city/louisville-ky-usa |title=Emporis:Louisville, KY |access-date=February 6, 2007}}</ref>

Louisville is located in Kentucky's outer [[Bluegrass region]].<ref>{{cite web |title=University of Kentucky Atlas entry |url = http://www.kyatlas.com/phys-bluegrass.html |access-date=August 22, 2009 }}</ref> Its development has been influenced by its location on the Ohio River, which spurred Louisville's growth from an isolated camp site into a major shipping port. Much of the city is located on a very wide and flat [[floodplain]] surrounded by hill country on all sides. Much of the area was swampland that had to be drained as the city grew. In the 1840s, most creeks were rerouted or placed in canals to prevent flooding and disease outbreaks.

Areas generally east of [[Interstate 65 in Kentucky|I-65]] are above the flood plain, and are composed of gently rolling hills. The southernmost parts of Jefferson County are in the scenic and largely undeveloped [[Knobs region]], which is home to [[Jefferson Memorial Forest]].

The [[Louisville metropolitan area|Louisville-Jefferson County, KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA), the [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|43rd largest]] in the United States,{{efn|name=MSAnote}}<ref name="PopEstMSA"/> includes the Kentucky county of Jefferson ([[wikt:coterminous|coterminous]] with Louisville Metro), plus twelve outlying counties—seven in Kentucky and five in [[Southern Indiana]]. Louisville's MSA is included in the [[Louisville metropolitan area|Louisville–Elizabethtown–Madison, KY–IN Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA), which also includes the [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky|Elizabethtown, KY]] MSA, as well as the [[Madison, Indiana|Madison, IN]] [[Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

The Louisville area is near several other urban areas, especially [[Frankfort, Kentucky]] (the state's capital), [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] (the two cities' metropolitan statistical areas almost border each other), [[Lexington, Kentucky]], and the [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] area (especially [[Columbus, Indiana]], to the north of Southern Indiana).

Louisville's late 19th- and early 20th-century development was spurred by three large suburban parks built at the edges of the city in 1890.

Since the mid-20th century, Louisville has in some ways been divided into three sides of town: the West End, the South End, and the East End. In 2003, Bill Dakan, a [[University of Louisville]] geography professor, said that the West End, west of 7th Street and north of Algonquin Parkway, is "a [[euphemism]] for the African American part of town" although he points out that this belief is not entirely true, and most African Americans no longer live in areas where more than 80% of residents are black.

Louisville hosts religious institutions of various faiths, including [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]] and the [[Baháʼí Faith]].

The 135,421 [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Louisvillians are part of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville|Archdiocese of Louisville]], covering 24 counties in central Kentucky, and consisting of 121 parishes and missions spread over {{convert|8124|sqmi|km2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archlou.org/history/statistics/ |title=Data on Catholic residents from the Archdiocese of Louisville |publisher=Archlou.org |access-date=July 28, 2009}}</ref> The [[Cathedral of the Assumption (Louisville, Kentucky)|Cathedral of the Assumption]] in downtown Louisville is the seat of the Archdiocese of Louisville. [[Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani|Our Lady of Gethsemani Abbey]], the monastic home of Catholic writer [[Thomas Merton]], is in nearby [[Bardstown, Kentucky]], and also in the archdiocese. Most of Louisville's Roman Catholic population is of German descent, the result of large-scale 19th-century immigration.

[[Bellarmine University]] and [[Spalding University]] in Louisville are affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church.

One in three Louisvillians is [[Southern Baptist]], belonging to one of 147 local congregations.<ref>Data on Baptist Population from LRA website [http://www.lrba.org/templates/System/details.asp?id=20083&PID=430832 Long Run Baptist Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201181541/http://www.lrba.org/templates/System/details.asp?id=20083&PID=430832 |date=February 1, 2015 }}</ref> This denomination increased in number when large numbers of people moved into Louisville in the early 20th century from rural Kentucky and [[Tennessee]] to work in the city's factories; some of these migrants also formed [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal churches]] and [[Churches of Christ]].

The [[Jew]]ish population of around 8,500 in the city is served by five [[synagogue]]s. Most Jewish families emigrated from [[Eastern Europe]] at the start of the 20th century; around 800 [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jews]] have moved to Louisville since 1991.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]] |title=Some synagogues eye broader styles of worship |date=September 28, 2003 |author=Smith, Peter}}</ref> Jewish immigrants founded Jewish Hospital in what was once the center of the city's Jewish district.

Louisville today is home to [[List of companies and organizations based in Louisville|dozens of companies and organizations]] across several [[industrial classification]]s. However, the underpinning of the city's economy since its earliest days has been the shipping and cargo industries. Its strategic location at the Falls of the Ohio, as well as its unique position in the central United States (within one day's road travel to 60 percent of the cities in the continental U.S.) make it a practical location for the transfer of cargo along its route to other destinations.<ref>{{cite book |title=Louisville Survey: Central Report |year=1978 |last=Kramer |first=Carl |page=32}}</ref> The [[Louisville and Portland Canal]] and the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] were important links in water and rail transportation.

Louisville's importance to the [[freight transport|shipping industry]] continues today with the presence of the [[Worldport (UPS air hub)|Worldport]] global air-freight hub for [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] at [[Louisville International Airport]]. Louisville's location at the crossroads of three major [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]] ([[Interstate 64 in Kentucky|I{{nbhyph}}64]], [[Interstate 65 in Kentucky|I{{nbhyph}}65]], and [[Interstate 71#Kentucky|I{{nbhyph}}71]]) also contributes to its modern-day strategic importance to the shipping and cargo industry. In addition, the Port of Louisville<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.portoflouisville.com/ |title=Port of Louisville |access-date=April 22, 2017}}</ref> continues Louisville's river shipping presence at [[Jefferson Riverport International]].

Louisville is home to many annual cultural events. Perhaps most well known is the [[Kentucky Derby]], held annually during the first Saturday of May. The Derby is preceded by a two-week-long [[Kentucky Derby Festival]], which starts with the annual [[Thunder Over Louisville]], the largest annual [[fireworks|fireworks display]] in North America.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lammers|first1=Braden|title=Distinguished service awards presented to the men behind Thunder Over Louisville|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2014/04/11/distinguished-service-awards-presented-to-the-men.html?page=all|access-date=October 16, 2014|work=Louisville Business First|publisher=[[American City Business Journals]]|date=April 11, 2014}}</ref> The Kentucky Derby Festival also features notable events such as the Pegasus Parade, [[Great Steamboat Race|The Great Steamboat Race]], Great [[Hot air ballooning#Competition|Balloon Race]], a combined [[marathon]]/[[mini marathon]] and about seventy events in total.

===Indie scene===

Louisville has blossomed as a booming center for independent art, music and business.

A Louisville locale that highlights this scene is [[Bardstown Road]], an area located in the heart of the [[The Highlands, Louisville|Highlands]]. Bardstown Road is known for its cultural diversity and local trade. The majority of the businesses along Bardstown Road, such as coffee shops, clothing stores and art galleries, are locally owned and operated businesses. Though it is only about a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) long, this strip of Bardstown Road constitutes much of the city's culture and diverse lifestyle, contributing to the unofficial "[[Keep Louisville Weird]]" slogan.

In downtown Louisville, [[21c Museum Hotel]], a hotel that showcases contemporary art installations and exhibitions throughout its public spaces, and features a red penguin on its roof, is, according to ''The New York Times'', "an innovative concept with strong execution and prompt and enthusiastic service".

Louisville is home to a thriving [[indie music scene]] with bands such as [[Love Jones (band)|Love Jones]], [[Tantric (band)|Tantric]], [[Squirrel Bait]], [[Cabin (band)|CABIN]], [[Slint]], [[My Morning Jacket]], [[Houndmouth]], [[Young Widows]] and [[Wax Fang]]. Acclaimed singer-songwriters [[Will Oldham]], who performs under the moniker "Bonnie 'Prince' Billy", is a resident, as was country/rock singer-songwriter [[Tim Krekel]]. Cellist [[Ben Sollee]] splits his time between Louisville and Lexington. Long running rock/jazz fusion band [[NRBQ]] also formed in Louisville in the late 1960s as well as 1980s [[psychobilly]] band [[Bodeco]]. [[Post-grunge]] band [[Days of the New]], at one time including future breakout pop star [[Nicole Scherzinger]], formed in Louisville in the mid-1990s.

The Louisville music scene reaches a crescendo every July during the [[Forecastle Festival]], a three-day music, art and environmental activism festival taking place at [[Louisville Waterfront Park]].

Especially catering to Louisville's music scene is 91.9 [[WFPK]] Radio Louisville, a local [[public broadcasting|public radio]] station funded, in part, from local listeners. The station features not only national and international musicians common to public radio, but also local and regional talent. The station also hosts summer concerts on the waterfront from April until July, where up-and-coming alternative artists are brought to stage.

{{Main|Sports in Louisville, Kentucky}}

[[College sports]] are popular in the Louisville area. The [[Louisville Cardinals]] have competed as members of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC), since joining that league in July 2014.

[[College basketball]] is particularly popular. The [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals]]'s [[Freedom Hall]] averaged sellouts for 10 straight years and the downtown [[KFC Yum! Center]] following suit with regular sellouts. The Cardinals ranked third nationally in attendance in [[2012–13 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|2012–13]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.psbin.com/a/j/rnpftk9inpzjrf/2013_release_men-s_basketball_attendance.pdf|title=2013 NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL ATTENDANCE|publisher=[[NCAA]]}}</ref> the most recent of the program's three national championship seasons. The Cardinals also hold the Big East conference women's basketball paid attendance record with nearly 17,000 attending the game against the [[Kentucky Wildcats women's basketball|Kentucky Wildcats]] in 2008.
The Louisville market has ranked first in ratings for the NCAA men's basketball tournament every year since 1999.<ref>{{cite news |title=Louisville No. 1 in basketball TV ratings |url=http://www.city-data.com/forum/kentucky/301079-louisville-market-1-ncaa-tournament-ratings.html |newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=April 8, 2008 |access-date=April 17, 2008}}</ref> The [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky Wildcats]] used to play an annual game in Freedom Hall.

The [[Louisville Cardinals football]] team has produced successful NFL players such as [[Johnny Unitas]], [[Deion Branch]], [[Sam Madison]], [[David Akers]], [[Joe Jacoby]] and [[Ray Buchanan]]. The Cardinals won the [[1991 Fiesta Bowl]], the [[2007 Orange Bowl]], and the [[2013 Sugar Bowl]]. In 2016, sophomore quarterback [[Lamar Jackson]] took the football team to new heights. Lamar was the school's first [[Heisman Trophy]] winner, which is awarded to the most outstanding college football player nationwide during that season. He was also one of the youngest players to ever receive the award. The team also matched their highest ranking in school history at No. 3. The University of Louisville [[baseball]] team advanced to the [[College World Series]] in Omaha in [[2007 College World Series|2007]], [[2013 College World Series|2013]], and [[2014 College World Series|2014]], as one of the final eight teams to compete for the national championship.
[[File:Derby.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Kentucky Derby]] in progress at [[Churchill Downs]]]]

Horse racing is also a major attraction. [[Churchill Downs]] is home to the [[Kentucky Derby]], the largest [[sport|sporting event]] in the state, as well as the [[Kentucky Oaks]] which together cap the two-week-long [[Kentucky Derby Festival]]. Churchill Downs has also hosted the renowned [[Breeders' Cup]] on eight occasions, most recently in 2011.

Louisville is also the home of [[Valhalla Golf Club]] which hosted the [[1996 PGA Championship|1996]], [[2000 PGA Championship|2000]] and [[2014 PGA Championship|2014]] [[PGA Championship]]s, the 2004 [[Senior PGA Championship]] and the [[2008 Ryder Cup]].

Louisville has seven professional and [[semi-professional]] sports teams, but no major league teams. It is the fourth largest U.S. city without one, with only [[Austin, Texas]], [[Fort Worth, Texas]] and [[El Paso, Texas]] larger. The [[Louisville Bats]] are a [[baseball]] team playing in the [[International League]] as the Class AAA affiliate of the nearby [[Cincinnati Reds]]. The team plays at [[Louisville Slugger Field]] at the edge of the city's downtown.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} [[Louisville City FC]], a professional soccer team in the second-division [[USL Championship]], began play in 2015 at Slugger Field and has moved into their own stadium, [[Lynn Family Stadium]], in 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rimpson |first=Robert |date=August 5, 2019 |title=Louisville City FC announces the name of its new soccer stadium in Butchertown |url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/soccer/louisville-city-fc/2019/08/05/louisville-city-fc-has-named-its-home-field-lynn-family-stadium/1920374001/ |work=The Courier-Journal |access-date=November 17, 2019}}</ref> The team was originally the reserve side for [[Orlando City SC]] of [[Major League Soccer]], but the two organizations were separated in 2016.

Between 1967 and 1976, Louisville was home to the [[Kentucky Colonels]] of the [[American Basketball Association]]. The Colonels was one of the ABA's most successful teams during its existence, winning four division titles and the 1975 ABA Championship, but was not invited to join the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] when the two leagues [[NBA-ABA merger|merged]] in 1976, and subsequently folded.

Louisville has the added distinction of being the only city in the world that is the birthplace of four heavyweight boxing champions: [[Marvin Hart]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Jimmy Ellis (boxer)|Jimmy Ellis]] and [[Greg Page (boxer)|Greg Page]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Loverro|first=Thom|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/9/muhammad-ali-louisville-boxing-jimmy-ellis/|title=Muhammad Ali always stood out among Louisville's four kings of boxing|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=June 9, 2016|access-date=March 15, 2017}}</ref>

[[File:WaterfrontPkDwnt.jpg|thumb|[[Louisville Waterfront Park]] exhibits rolling hills, spacious lawns and walking paths in the [[Downtown Louisville|downtown]] area.]]

Louisville Metro has 122 city [[park]]s covering more than {{convert|13000|acre|km2}}. Several of these parks were designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who also designed New York City's [[Central Park]] as well as parks, parkways, college campuses and public facilities in many U.S. locations. The [[Louisville Waterfront Park]] is prominently located on the banks of the [[Ohio River]] near downtown and features large open areas, which often hold free [[concert]]s and other [[festival]]s. The [[Big Four Bridge]], a former railroad bridge spanning {{convert|547|ft|m}} but is now a pedestrian bridge connecting Waterfront Park with Jeffersonville, Indiana's waterfront park, fully opened in May 2014 with the completion of Jeffersonville's ramp.<ref>{{cite news|title=Big Four Bridge walkway about to be a step closer|newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]]|date=May 16, 2007|author=Shafer, Sheldon}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Lord, Joseph |title=Indiana Side of Big Four Bridge Is Opening This Afternoon |url=http://wfpl.org/post/indiana-side-big-four-bridge-opening-afternoon |publisher=[[WFPL]] |date=May 20, 2014 |access-date=June 22, 2014}}</ref> [[Cherokee Park]], one of the most visited parks in the nation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tpl.org/content_documents/citypark_facts/ccpe_Most_Visited_Parks_08.pdf |title=America's Most Visited City Parks |date=October 1, 2008 |access-date=March 31, 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5fgh5pn16?url=http://www.tpl.org/content_documents/citypark_facts/ccpe_Most_Visited_Parks_08.pdf |archive-date=March 31, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> features a {{convert|2.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} mixed-use loop and many well-known landscaping and architectural features including the [[Hogan's Fountain Pavilion]]. Other notable parks in the system include [[Iroquois Park]], [[Shawnee Park]], [[Seneca Park]] and [[Central Park, Louisville|Central Park]].

Further from the downtown area is the [[Jefferson Memorial Forest]], which at {{convert|6218|acre|km2}} is the largest municipal [[urban forest]] in the United States.,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://louisvilleky.gov/News/WideNewsItem.htm|title=City News|website=LouisvilleKy.gov}}</ref> The forest is designated as a [[National Audubon Society]] [[wildlife refuge]] and offers over {{convert|30|mi|km}} of various hiking trails.
[[File:MetroLoopLBT.jpg|thumb|left|A section of the [[Louisville Loop]] bike and pedestrian trail]]

[[Otter Creek Outdoor Recreation Area]], owned and operated by the [[Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources]], is another large park in nearby [[Brandenburg, Kentucky]]. The park's namesake, Otter Creek, winds along the eastern side of the park. A scenic bend in the [[Ohio River]], which divides Kentucky from [[Indiana]], can be seen from northern overlooks within the park. The park is a [[mountain biking]] destination, with trails maintained by a local [[mountain bike]] organization.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Other outdoor points of interest in the Louisville area include [[Cave Hill Cemetery]] (the burial location of [[Colonel Sanders|Col. Harland Sanders]]), [[Zachary Taylor National Cemetery]] (the burial location of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Zachary Taylor]]), the [[Louisville Zoo]] and the [[Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area]].

In development is the [[City of Parks]], a project to create a {{convert|110|mi|adj=on}} continuous paved pedestrian and biking trail called the [[Louisville Loop]] around Louisville Metro while also adding a large amount of park land. Current plans call for making approximately {{convert|4000|acre|km2}} of the [[Floyds Fork]] flood plain in eastern [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] into a new park system called [[The Parklands of Floyds Fork]], expanding area in the Jefferson Memorial Forest, and adding riverfront land and wharfs along the Riverwalk and the Levee Trail, both completed segments of the Louisville Loop.

{{Main|Government of Louisville, Kentucky}}
{{See also|List of mayors of Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville Metro Council|Government of Kentucky}}

On January 6, 2003, Louisville [[consolidated city-county|merged]] its government with that of Jefferson County, forming [[wikt:coterminous|coterminous]] borders.<ref name="Louisville Metro Consolidation"/> Louisville was the second and only other city in the state to merge with its county since [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] merged with [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]] in 1974.

Louisville Metro is governed by an executive called the [[List of mayors of Louisville, Kentucky|Metro Mayor]] and a [[city council|city legislature]] called the [[Louisville Metro Council|Metro Council]]. The second and current Metro Mayor is [[Greg Fischer]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]), who entered office on January 3, 2011.

The Metro Council consists of 26 seats representing districts apportioned by population throughout the city and county. The residents of the semi-independent municipalities within Louisville Metro are apportioned to districts along with all other county residents. Half (13) of the seats come up for reelection every two years. The council is chaired by a [[Louisville Metro Council President|Council President]], currently David Yates (D), who is elected by the council members annually. Democrats currently have a 17-to-9 majority.

Before merger, under the [[Kentucky Constitution]] and statutory law Louisville was designated as a [[List of cities in Kentucky#Classes|first-class]] city in regard to local laws affecting public safety, alcohol beverage control, revenue options, and various other matters; as of 2014, it is the only such designated city in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.klc.org/UserFiles/TheBasics2011_Sept(2).pdf |title=KLC Research Report: The Basics of Kentucky Cities |access-date=August 4, 2012 |date=September 2011 |publisher=Kentucky League of Cities}}</ref>

The Official Seal of the City of Louisville, no longer used following the merger, reflected its history and heritage in the [[fleur-de-lis]] representing French aid given during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and the thirteen stars signifying the original colonies. The new [[Seal of Louisville, Kentucky|Seal of Louisville Metro]] retains the fleur-de-lis, but has only two stars, one representing the city and the other the county.

[[Kentucky's 3rd congressional district]] encompasses most of Louisville Metro, and is represented by [[United States House of Representatives|Rep.]] [[John Yarmuth]] (D). Far eastern portions of the county are part of the [[Kentucky's 4th congressional district|4th congressional district]], which is represented by [[Thomas Massie]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/KY/3 |title=Kentucky's 3rd Congressional District—Representatives & District Map |access-date=August 19, 2014 |publisher=GovTrack.us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/KY/4 |title=Kentucky's 4th Congressional District—Representatives & District Map |access-date=August 19, 2014 |publisher=GovTrack.us}}</ref>

[[File:LMEMS 1255 (8).JPG|thumb|[[Louisville Metro EMS]] [[ambulance]]]]

The primary law enforcement agencies are the [[Louisville Metro Police Department]] (LMPD) and the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office (JCSO). ''911'' [[emergency medical services]] are provided by the government as [[Louisville Metro EMS]] (LMEMS) which responds to over 120,000 calls for service annually. Louisville Metro Department of Corrections operates two facilities housing approximately 2,000 inmates.

Louisville has recently been featured on the television show ''[[First 48]]''. The show follows LMPD's homicide unit while they try to solve murders.

Fire protection is provided by 16 independent [[fire department]]s working in concert through [[mutual aid (emergency services)|mutual aid]] agreements. The only fire department operated by Metro Government is [[Louisville Division of Fire|Louisville Fire & Rescue]], the successor to the pre-merger Louisville Division of Fire. The city of [[Shively, Kentucky|Shively]] in western [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] possesses an independent fire department that uses the same dispatch and radio channels as Louisville Fire and Rescue.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The other 14 fire departments in Louisville-Jefferson County are run by independent taxing districts, collectively referred to as the [[Jefferson County Fire Service]] (JCFS); the county fire service coordinates dispatch, training, and standardization for its member departments.

Two major graduate-professional schools of religion are also located in Louisville. The [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]], with more than 5,300 students, is the flagship institution of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]]. It was founded in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1859 and moved to Louisville in 1877, occupying its present campus on Lexington Road in 1926. [[Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary]], product of a 1901 merger of two predecessor schools founded at [[Danville, Kentucky]] in 1853 and in Louisville in 1893, occupied its present campus on Alta Vista Road in 1963.

==Media==

{{Main|Media in Louisville, Kentucky}}

Louisville's [[newspaper]] of record is ''[[The Courier-Journal]]''. The alternative paper is the progressive [[alternative weekly|alt-weekly]] ''[[Louisville Eccentric Observer]]'' (commonly called 'LEO'), which was founded by [[Kentucky's 3rd congressional district|3rd district]] [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[John Yarmuth]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]).

[[WAVE (TV)|WAVE 3]], an [[NBC]] affiliate, was Kentucky's first TV station.

==Transportation==

{{See also|Roads in Louisville, Kentucky}}

As with most American cities, transportation in Louisville is based primarily on automobiles. However, the city traces its foundation to the era where the river was the primary [[Mode of transport|means of transportation]], and railroads have been an important part of local industry for over a century. In more recent times, Louisville has become an international hub for [[Cargo airline|air cargo]].
[[File:Kennedy Interchange Photo Diagram.JPG|thumb|upright=1.45|[[Kennedy Interchange]] ("Spaghetti Junction"), prior to the [[Ohio River Bridges Project]]]]

Louisville has inner and outer [[Interstate Highway System|interstate]] beltways, [[Interstate 264 (Kentucky)|I{{nbhyph}}264]] and [[Interstate 265|I{{nbhyph}}265]] respectively. Interstates [[Interstate 64 in Kentucky|I{{nbhyph}}64]] and [[Interstate 65 in Kentucky|I{{nbhyph}}65]] pass through Louisville, and [[Interstate 71#Kentucky|I-71]] has its southern terminus in Louisville. Since all three of these highways intersect at virtually the same location on the east side of [[downtown Louisville|downtown]], this spot has become known as "[[Kennedy Interchange|Spaghetti Junction]]". Two bridges carry I{{nbhyph}}64 and I{{nbhyph}}65 over the Ohio River, and a [[George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge|third automobile bridge]] carries non-interstate traffic, including bicyclists and pedestrians. Immediately east of downtown is the [[Big Four Bridge]], a former railroad bridge now renovated as a pedestrian bridge.

The [[Ohio River Bridges Project]], a plan under consideration for decades to construct two new interstate bridges over the Ohio River to connect Louisville to Indiana, including a reconfiguration of Spaghetti Junction, began construction in 2012.<ref>{{cite news |author=Collier, Rachel |title=Construction to begin soon on The Ohio River Bridges Project |url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/19370142/construction-to-begin-soon-on-the-ohio-river-bridges-project |publisher=[[WDRB]] |date=August 24, 2012 |access-date=June 22, 2014}}</ref> One bridge, the [[Abraham Lincoln Bridge]], is located downtown beside the existing [[John F.

[[File:Ksdf.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Louisville International Airport]]]]

Louisville's main airport is the centrally located [[Louisville International Airport]], whose [[IATA Airport code]] (SDF) reflects its former name of Standiford Field. The airport is also home to [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]'s [[Worldport (UPS air hub)|Worldport]] global air hub. UPS operates its largest package-handling hub at Louisville International Airport and bases its [[UPS Airlines]] division there. Over 4.2&nbsp;million passengers and over 4.7&nbsp;billion pounds (2,350,000 t) of cargo pass through the airport each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transtats.bts.gov/airports.asp?pn=1&Airport=SDF&Airport_Name=Louisville,%20KY:%20Louisville%20International-Standiford%20Field&carrier=FACTS |title=Louisville, KY: Louisville International-Standiford Field (SDF) |date=March 2014 |access-date=July 6, 2014}}</ref> It is also the third busiest airport in the United States in terms of cargo traffic, and seventh busiest for such in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aci.aero/News/Releases/Most-Recent/2014/03/31/Preliminary-World-Airport-Traffic-and-Rankings-2013--High-Growth-Dubai-Moves-Up-to-7th-Busiest-Airport- |title=Preliminary World Airport Traffic and Rankings 2013—High Growth Dubai Moves Up to 7th Busiest Airport |date=March 31, 2014 |access-date=July 6, 2014 |publisher=Airports Council International}}</ref> Only about 35 minutes from [[Fort Knox]], the airport is also a major hub for armed services personnel. The historic but smaller [[Bowman Field (Kentucky)|Bowman Field]] is used mainly for [[general aviation]] while nearby [[Clark Regional Airport]] is used mostly by private jets.

The [[McAlpine Locks and Dam]] is located on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River, near the downtown area. The locks were constructed to allow shipping past the [[Falls of the Ohio National Wildlife Conservation Area|Falls of the Ohio]]. In 2001 over 55 million tons of commodities passed through the locks.
[[File:Louisville 4thStreet trolley.jpg|thumb|right|Toonerville II Trolleys provided transportation in [[downtown Louisville]] until late 2014, before being replaced by LouLift.]]

[[Public transportation]] consists mainly of buses run by the [[Transit Authority of River City]] (TARC). The city buses serve all parts of downtown Louisville and [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]], as well as Kentucky suburbs in [[Oldham County, Kentucky|Oldham County]], [[Bullitt County, Kentucky|Bullitt County]], and the [[Indiana]] suburbs of Jeffersonville, [[Clarksville, Indiana|Clarksville]] and [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]]. In addition to regular city buses, transit throughout the downtown hotel and shopping districts is served by a fleet of [[Zero-emissions vehicle|zero-emissions buses]] called LouLift. In late 2014, these vehicles replaced the series of motorized trolleys known as the ''Toonerville II Trolley''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gee|first1=Dawne|title=TARC replaces trolleys with ZeroBus|url=http://www.wave3.com/story/27690555/tarc-replaces-trolleys-with-zerobus|access-date=September 29, 2015|publisher=[[WAVE (TV)|WAVE]]|date=December 22, 2014}}</ref> A [[light rail]] system has been studied and proposed for the city, but no plan was in development as of 2007.<ref>{{cite news |first=Marcus |last=Green |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courier_journal/access/1749372341.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Nov+29%2C+2006&author=&pub=Courier+-+Journal&edition=&startpage=B.1&desc=Mass+transit+plan+still+possible |title=Mass transit plan still possible; Officials will look for financing options |newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date=November 29, 2006 |access-date=January 23, 2007}}</ref>

Louisville has historically been a major center for [[railway]] traffic. The [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] was once headquartered here, before it was purchased by [[CSX Transportation]]. Today the city is served by two major freight railroads, CSX (with a major [[classification yard]] in the southern part of the metro area) and [[Norfolk Southern]]. Five major main lines connect Louisville to the rest of the region. Two regional railroads, the [[Paducah and Louisville Railway]] and the [[Louisville and Indiana Railroad]], also serve the city. With the discontinuance of the stop in Louisville in 2003 for a more northerly route between [[New York City|New York]] and Chicago, the ''[[Kentucky Cardinal (Amtrak)|Kentucky Cardinal]]'' no longer serves the city; it is thus the fifth largest city in the country with no passenger rail service.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.trainweb.org/moksrail/documents/pop/msa.htm |title=Metropolitan Areas Served by Amtrak |date=November 23, 2006 |access-date=April 21, 2009}}</ref>

In 2016 [[Walk Score]] ranked Louisville 43rd "most walkable" of 141 U.S. cities with a population greater than 200,000.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.walkscore.com/cities-and-neighborhoods/ |title=Most Walkable Cities in the US |year=2016 |publisher=[[Walk Score]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170131231927/https://www.walkscore.com/cities-and-neighborhoods/ |archive-date=January 31, 2017 |url-status=live |access-date=May 6, 2017 }}</ref>

==Utilities==

[[File:Louisville water tower.jpg|thumb|upright|Completed in 1860, the [[Louisville Water Tower]] is the oldest water tower in the U.S.]]

Electricity is provided to the Louisville Metro area by [[Louisville Gas & Electric]].
Water is provided by the [[Louisville Water Company]], which provides water to more than 800,000 residents in Louisville as well as parts of [[Oldham County, Kentucky|Oldham]] and [[Bullitt County, Kentucky|Bullitt]] counties. Additionally, they provide wholesale water to the outlying counties of [[Shelby County, Kentucky|Shelby]], [[Spencer County, Kentucky|Spencer]] and [[Nelson County, Kentucky|Nelson]].<ref>Data from [http://www.louisvilleky.gov/LWC Louisville Water]</ref>

The [[Ohio River]] provides for most of the city's source of [[drinking water]]. Water is drawn from the river at two points: the [[raw water]] [[pumping station|pump station]] at Zorn Avenue and River Road, and the B.E. Payne Pump Station northeast of [[Harrods Creek, Louisville|Harrods Creek]]. Water is also obtained from a riverbank infiltration well at the Payne Plant. There are also two [[water purification|water treatment plants]] serving the Louisville Metro area: The Crescent Hill Treatment Plant and the B.E. Payne Treatment Plant. In June 2008, the Louisville Water Company received the "Best of the Best" award from the American Water Works Association, citing it as the best-tasting drinking water in the country.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.awwa.org/publications/MainStreamArticle.cfm?itemnumber=36618 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326024952/http://www.awwa.org/publications/MainStreamArticle.cfm?itemnumber=36618 |archive-date=March 26, 2012 |title=Louisville wins best water taste test |date=June 10, 2008 |publisher=American Water Works Association |access-date=March 8, 2010}}</ref>

==Events==

Important events occurring in the city have included the first large space lighted by Edison's [[incandescent light bulb|light bulb]] which occurred during the [[Southern Exposition]]. (At the time, in 1883, the largest such installation to date.) Also, Louisville had the first [[public library|library]] open to [[African American]]s in the South,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/Subject/lama.html |title=African Americans in Library Professions: The Kentucky Connection |publisher=Uky.edu |date=December 7, 2004 |access-date=July 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121190156/http://www.uky.edu/Subject/lama.html |archive-date=January 21, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lfpl.org/western/htms/archives.htm |title=African-American Archives |publisher=Louisville Free Public Library |access-date=July 28, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402131302/http://www.lfpl.org/western/htms/archives.htm |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and medical advances including the first human [[hand transplantation|hand transplant]] in 1999<ref name=":0" /><ref name="hand transplant" /> and the first self-contained [[artificial heart]] transplant.<ref name="heart transplant" />
