'''Maine East High School''', or '''Maine East''', and officially '''Maine Township High School East''', is a public four-year high school located at the corner of [[U.S. Route 14|Dempster Street]] and Potter Road in [[Park Ridge, Illinois]], a northwest suburb of Chicago, in the United States. It is part of [[Maine Township High School District 207]], which also includes [[Maine South High School]] and [[Maine West High School]].

Maine East is best known today for the diversity of its student body with from several dozen countries on every continent besides [[Antarctica]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The building itself, constructed in the 1920s, is noted for its distinct [[Art Deco]] style.

==History==
[[Maine East]] was known as '''Maine Township High School''' when it was built in 1929 as a replacement for the original Maine Township High School, which itself had been built in 1902. Until 1959, when [[Maine West High School]] was built, it was the only school in the district. The school was built with an indoor rifle shooting range and a swimming pool. Over the years, the shooting range was closed and the swimming pool closed with a larger modern pool opened in a new section of the building.

In the early 1920s, Maine Township became the first high school in Illinois to teach courses in automotive repair and [[telegraph]]y.<ref>{{Citation | last = Friedlund | first = Thomas (publishing consultant) | title = Niles Centennial History| publisher = Walsworth Publishing | year = 1999 }}</ref>

During the [[Great Depression]], most of the staff taught without financial compensation, as the district could not afford to meet salaries. As thanks, local merchants provided necessities to the staff free of charge.

In 1936, Maine East's band director, Alexander Harley, along with his wife Frances, founded Maine Music Masters as a way of honoring musicians in the school band. The idea spread and, in 1952, the chapters at individual high schools were incorporated as Modern Music Masters. In 1983, it was renamed [[Tri-M]] Music Honor Society. Today, it is the largest international honor society in music education.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.menc.org/information/trim/overview_intro.html |title=History of Tri-M |access-date=September 22, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011545/http://www.menc.org/information/trim/overview_intro.html |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In December 1959, the student-operated radio station [[WMTH-FM]] went on the air. The first broadcast was of a basketball game in the school fieldhouse. The sportscaster students were [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Marshal Seese]]. Ford went on to become a major movie star and Marshall went on to be a weather-caster at [[The Weather Channel]].

For a short amount of time, in 1958–1959, there were so many students enrolled in the school (approximately 7,000) that the school day was split into two parts so that half of the population attended in the morning and half in the afternoon. The largest graduating class was the class of 1970 with just under 1,100 students, just before the opening of Maine North High School. Prior to that, graduating classes of about 1,000 students were in 1959, just before [[Maine West High School]] opened, and the Class of 1964, just before [[Maine South High School]] opened. When [[Maine North High School]] closed in 1981, a majority of the students from that school were sent to Maine East, with the remainder being sent to Maine West High School and Glenbrook South High School.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Building and grounds==
[[File:Powell Library, UCLA (front view).jpg|thumb|The [[Powell Library]] at [[UCLA]]. This building's architecture inspired the design of Maine East HS.]]
The architecture of the original building was inspired by the architecture of the [[Powell Library|Powell Library Building]] at [[UCLA]].  The original building was "L"-shaped, with a long wing running north–south, parallel to Potter Road. A shorter wing runs east–west, parallel to Dempster Street, with both wings meeting at "the tower" where the main entrance is located. Each of the wings is three stories tall.

The tower is six stories tall, though the higher floors are not in use today because of fire hazard (there is only one narrow staircase granting access to these floors). The fourth floor contains the new heating and air-conditioning systems. The "tower" originally housed the art and music rooms, but since 1960 houses the broadcasting transmitter for [[WMTH-FM|WMTH 90.5 FM]], the student-operated radio station.  Following World War II and up into the late 1960s aviation classes were given with the use of a [[Link Trainer]] installed in the tower. The sixth floor also has a balcony on the outside from which there is a distant view, on some days, of the Chicago skyline.

The school has two swimming pools. The newer one is used for [[physical education]] classes, and by the interscholastic [[water polo]] and swimming and [[Diving (sport)|diving]] teams. The original [[natatorium]], located in the basement, has been shut down due to the need for financially unfeasible repairs, but is kept for its irreplaceable decorative mosaics, which could be damaged with further exposure to water and chemicals.

The school also has a [[firing range]] in the [[basement]] that was in use when the school opened, as training with firearms was considered essential for young men in the wake of [[World War I]]. The firing range was also used for [[World War II]] because many people wanted to join the military. Though today used for storage, it is believed to be one of the few non-military academies to still have a usable firing range on the premises.

On the [[American football]] / [[track and field]] field there is a memorial for Maine East World War II alumni behind the stadium.

Starting in 1988, the school's ecology club began a clean-up and restoration of a small section of the property which was native [[savanna]].<ref name="102595 article">{{cite news | last = Cascio| first = Stefanie| title = KID ECOLOGISTS SAVE SAVANNA MAINE EAST HIGH SCHOOL CLUB WORKS 7 YEARS ON AREA| pages = 1|work=Chicago Tribune| date = October 25, 1995| id = {{ProQuest|283987157}}}}</ref> In addition to general clean-up, students began annual [[buck thorn]] cutting days.<ref name="102595 article"/> In addition to some [[endangered species]], trees as old as 200 years were identified.<ref name="102595 article"/>

==Academics==
[[File:MaineEastHSRearEntrance.png|thumb|right|The rear entrance of the original building. The brick pedestal at lower right is topped by a sundial, dedicated to the school's science department.]]

Maine East has been ranked in the top 1,500 of America's public schools (based on the [[Challenge Index]]), as reported by ''[[Newsweek]]''. In 2009, the school ranked #1,192 and in 2006 it ranked #1,181.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/201160/?q=2009/rank/1201 ''The Top of the Class The complete list of the 1,500 top U.S. high schools''; 8 June 2009; ''Newsweek''; accessed 20 June 2009]</ref>

==Activities==
Maine East High School is active in United States [[policy debate]] and hosts a tournament with regional significance to Great Lakes-region high school debaters, as those advancing far enough receive a bid to attend the national Tournament of Champions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}
