'''Leonel de Moura Brizola''' (22 January 1922 – 21 June 2004) was a [[Brazil|Brazilian]] politician. Launched in politics by [[Getúlio Vargas]] Brazil's [[caudillo]] in the 1930-50s, Brizola was the only politician to serve as elected governor of two Brazilian states, before and after the 1964–1985 [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]]. An [[engineer]] by training, Brizola organized the [[youth wing]] of the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|Brazilian Labour Party]] and served as state representative for [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and mayor of its capital, [[Porto Alegre]]. In 1958 he was elected governor and subsequently played a major role in thwarting a coup attempt by sectors of the armed forces in 1961, who wished to stop his brother-in-law [[João Goulart]] from taking power, under allegations of [[Communist Party of Brazil|communist]] ties, in a constitutional crisis caused by [[Jânio Quadros]]' resignation, leading a [[Civil disobedience|civil and military disobedience]] campaign dubbed the [[:pt:Campanha_da_Legalidade|Campanha da Legalidade]]. In the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état]], Brizola again attempted to resist but Goulart did not want to risk the possibility of civil war, and Brizola was exiled in [[Uruguay]]. 

One of the few Brazilian major political figures able to overcome the dictatorship's twenty-years ban on his political activity, Brizola returned to Brazil in 1979, but failed in his bid to take control of the reemerging [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|Brazilian Labour Party]] as the military government instead conceded it to [[Ivete Vargas]]. Brizola founded the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]] on a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]], [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Populism|populist]] platform descended from [[Getúlio Vargas]]' own [[Labour movement|''trabalhismo'']] legacy, promoted as an ideology he called ''socialismo moreno'' ("[[brown socialism]]"), a non-Marxist, [[Christian socialism|Christian]] and markedly Brazilian left-wing political agenda for a post-Cold War setting. In 1982 and 1990 he was elected governor of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], after a failed [[1989 Brazilian presidential election|1989 bid for the presidency]], in which he narrowly finished third, after [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]. In the 1990s, Brizola disputed for preeminence in the Brazilian left with future president Lula [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]], later briefly integrating his government in the early 2000s. He was also vice-president of the [[Socialist International]] and served as Honorary President of that organization from October 2003 until his death in June 2004. Known for his sharp, energetic rhetoric and frank, direct style, Brizola is considered one of the most important historic figures of the Brazilian left.

== Early life and rise to prominence (1922–1964) ==
[[File:Leonel Brizola em sua juventude.png|thumb|upright|left|Brizola during the late 1930s]]
Brizola's father José Brizola was a small-scale farmer who was killed when fighting as a volunteer in 1923 in a local civil war for the rebel leader Assis Brasil against Rio Grande's dictator, [[Borges de Medeiros]].<ref>F.C. Leite Filho, ''El caudillo Leonel Brizola: um perfil biográfico''. São Paulo: Aquariana, 2008, {{ISBN|978-85-7217-112-0}}, pages 233/234; others, however, contend that Brizola's father was simply a common thief murdered for running away with someone else's livestock: Cf.  R. S. Rose, ''The Unpast: Elite Violence And Social Control In Brazil, 1954–2000''. Ohio University Press, 2005, pages 54/55</ref> Brizola was named Itagiba, but early in life he adopted the alias Leonel, which he took from the rebel warlord [[Leonel Rocha]] who had commanded the cavalry column in which José Brizola served.<ref>Leite Filho, ''El Caudillo Leonel Brizola'', 32</ref> Brizola left his mother's house at the age of eleven; he worked in [[Passo Fundo]] and [[Carazinho]] as a newspaper deliverer, [[shoeshiner]] and at other occasional jobs. Aided by the family of a [[Methodist Church|Methodist]] minister, he received a scholarship that allowed him to complete high school in [[Porto Alegre]] and enter college.<ref>Jorge Ferreira, ''João Goulart: Uma biografia''. Rio de Janeiro: José Olympio, 2015, {{ISBN|978-85-200-1254-3}}</ref> He graduated with a degree in engineering but never worked in that trade. Still as an undergraduate, he entered professional politics in his early twenties, entering the youth organization of the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|Brazilian Labor Party]] (''Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro'' (PTB)) in 1945. In 1946 an undergraduate, he was elected to the Rio Grande State Legislature.<ref>[http://www.pdt.org.br/personalidades/bzie011299.htm PDT homepage]</ref> The Labor Party had been created in order to offer political support for former President/dictator [[Getúlio Dornelles Vargas|Getúlio Vargas]] among the working classes, and Brizola, who was busy with creating party organizations across Rio Grande, at the time developed ties to the Vargas family through his personal friendship with Vargas's son Maneco as well as with Vargas's brother Espartaco,<ref>Lira Neto, ''Getúlio 1945-1954''. São Paulo: Cia. das Letras, 2014, {{ISBN|978-85-359-2470-1}}, page 151</ref> such friendships opening his way to make friends with Vargas himself, who was in internal exile after having been toppled from power in late 1945.<ref>Leite Filho, ''El Caudillo Leonel Brizola'',41</ref> As a member of the State Legislature, Brizola made a speech from the tribune in which he launched nationwide the candidacy of Vargas to the incoming 1950 presidential elections.<ref>Lira Neto, 151</ref>

In 1950, Brizola married Neusa Goulart—[[João Goulart]]'s sister—and had Vargas as his best man. Through this marriage, Brizola became a wealthy landowner and a regional leader of the PTB. After Vargas's 1954 suicide during his second presidential term, Brizola inherited the undisputed regional leadership of his party while his brother-in-law ruled the PTB national caucus.<ref>Cf. Carlos E. Cortés, ''Gaúcho politics in Brazil: the politics of Rio Grande do Sul, 1930–1964''. Albuquerque : University of New Mexico Press, 1974, page 162</ref> Both perpetuated Vargas' [[populism|populist]] tradition; in Brizola's case, the practice of a direct personal link between charismatic leader and the general public. In quick succession, Brizola filled various positions, being a member of the Rio Grande State Legislature for two terms (and as such leader for the PTB), State Secretary for Public Works, (interim) Federal Congressman for Rio Grande in 1955 and Mayor of Porto Alegre from 1956 to 1958. In 1958 he would resign from his mayoralty in order to present himself as a contender at the elections for State Governor.<ref>Leite Filho, ''El Caudillo Leonel Brizola'',43</ref> From a regional leadership, Brizola would then ascend, during the presidency of Goulart (1961&ndash;1964) to the role of an important national supporter of his brother-in-law; first as governor and later as a deputy in the [[National Congress of Brazil]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

[[File:Leonel Brizola tomando posse como governador do Rio Grande do Sul.tif|thumb|Brizola during his inauguration ceremony as governor of Rio Grande do Sul, 1959]]
As governor of Rio Grande do Sul (1959–63), Brizola rose to prominence for his social policies that included the quick building of public schools in poor neighborhoods across the state (''brizoletas'').<ref>Cf. Arthur José Poerner, ''Brizola quem é?'' Rio de Janeiro, 1989: Editora Terceiro Mundo, page16</ref> He supported policies directed towards improving the conditions of small-scale, autonomous farmers and landless rural workers, and the sponsorship of the creation of the corporation MASTER (Rio Grande Landless Rural Workers Movement).<ref>Biorn Maybury-Lewis, ''The Politics of the Possible: The Brazilian Rural Workers' Trade Union Movement, 1964–1985''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|1-56639-167-9}}, page 126</ref>

Brizola gained nationwide attention by acting in defense of democracy and Goulart's rights as president. When [[Jânio Quadros]] resigned from the presidency in August 1961, the Brazilian military ministers in the Cabinet tried to prevent Vice-President Goulart from becoming president on the grounds of his alleged ties with the Communist movement.<ref>Cf. John W. F. Dulles, ''Castello Branco: the making of a Brazilian president''. College Station, Texas A&M University Press, 1978, page 250. What created the crisis around Goulart was the fact that the Brazilian 1946 Constitution allowed for the (direct) election of a President and Vice-President from different tickets; therefore the leftist Goulart was Vice-President to the maverick rightist Quadros.</ref> After winning support from local army commander [[General Machado Lopes]], Brizola forged the [[Legality Broadcast (Brazil-1961)|''cadeia da legalidade'' (legality broadcast)]] from a pool of radio stations in Rio Grande do Sul, which issued a nationwide call from [[Palácio Piratini]] denouncing the intentions behind the Cabinet ministers' actions and encouraging common citizens to protest in the streets. Brizola surrendered the State Police Force to the regional army command and began organizing paramilitary Committees of Democratic Resistance, and considered handing out firearms to civilians.<ref>Cf. Angelina Cheibub Figueiredo, ''Democracia ou Reformas?''. Rio de Janeiro: Paz e Terra, 1993, page 43</ref> After twelve days of impending civil war, the attempted coup failed and Goulart was inaugurated as president.<ref>cf. Betariz T.

===Nationalizations of industrial utilities in Rio Grande and Cold War politics===

Brizola gained international attention for his nationalist policies; as governor he developed his plan for quick industrialization of the state, a program for the constitution of state-owned industrial utilities,<ref>Samir Perrone de Miranda, "Projeto de Desenvolvimento e Encampações no discurso do governo Leonel Brizola: Rio Grande do Sul, 1959-1963". UFRGS, Master dissertation in Political Science, 2006, available at [http://www.lume.ufrgs.br/bitstream/handle/10183/6526/000531324.pdf?sequence=1]. Retrieved June 26, 2014</ref> that led him to nationalize American public utilities trusts' assets in Rio Grande, such as [[ITT Corporation|ITT]] and Electric Bond & Share (local branch of American & Foreign Power Company (Amforp for short), itself owned by the holding [[Electric Bond and Share Company]] ).<ref>Ruth Leacock, ''Requiem for revolution: the United States and Brazil, 1961–1969''. Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1990, page 85. {{ISBN|978-0-87338-402-5}} . Available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=PB__6STEkH0C&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=leonel+brizola+ITT&source=bl&ots=HwQNXOnjeW&sig=NkRSs8h35OjQ9TL3TBfQfnih7YE&hl=en&ei=shbGS4DCNYKkuAes96ScDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=leonel%20brizola%20ITT&f=false]. Page 89</ref>

At the time as well as later, many scholars believed such nationalizations to express socialist policy.<ref>G. Reginald Daniel, ''Race and Multiraciality in Brazil and the United States: Converging Paths?''. Pennsylvania University Press: 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-271-02883-5}}, page 181</ref> However, the reason offered by Brizola for the nationalization - in fact almost an expropriation, as the compensation given was of only one monetary unit, pending settlement by a Brazilian court<ref>Leacock, ''Requiem for Revolution'', 86</ref>- was simply that both American enterprises, although profiting from previously existing infrastructures, nevertheless supplied limited quantities of utilities at the highest possible rates to final consumers and reinvested a tiny fraction of their profits, the remaining "excess" profits being "repatriated".Therefore, these foreign contractors were considered by Brizola as unreliable for playing a role as tools in a longterm blueprint for industrialization.<ref>Leite Filho, ''El Caudillo Leonel Brizola'',63-65</ref> Earlier, Brizola had offered ITT to participate in a new mixed, state-private ownership telephone company, which would be financed through the selling of new shares to the State of Rio Grande as well as to the general public - in this new company, ITT would remain with a 25% share. As Leacock writes, this proposal probably failed because ITT CEOs didn't want to participate in a joint venture they would not control.<ref>Leacock, ''Requiem for revolution'', 86</ref>  That Brizola's avowedly reasons corresponded to his actual goals is supported by a later American scholar, who considers that Brizola's administration, albeit "marred" by these "controversial" nationalizations, was nevertheless "vigorous and constructive".<ref>Michael L. Conniff, ed., ''Populism in Latin America: Second Edition''. Tuscaloosa: The University of Alabama Press, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-8173-5709-2}}, page 59</ref> Other American scholar remembers that the same rightist military government that would later exile Brizola found it necessary to nationalize the ''entire'' Brazilian telecommunications system in other to develop necessary infrastructures.<ref>Sybil Rhodes, ''Social Movements and Free-Market Capitalism in Latin America: Telecommunications Privatization and the Rise of Consumer Protest''. SUNY Press, 2012, {{ISBN|0-7914-6597-7}}, page 108</ref>

Of the two major American contractors involved in Brizola's nationalization, Amforp was far more accommodating; it had been operating at a loss in Brazil and was confident of striking a deal with the Federal government -i.e. Goulart - in order to close its Brazilian operation.<ref>Noel Maurer, ''The Empire Trap: The Rise and Fall of U.S. Intervention to Protect American Property Overseas, 1893-2013''. Princeton University Press, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-691-15582-1}}, page 329</ref> ITT had been also operating at a loss; nevertheless, as it had already been taken by surprise by the expropriation of its property in Cuba by [[Fidel Castro]], the nationalization of its Brazilian operation - no matter how unprofitable - was seem by it as something that could set a precedent to the whole of Latin America.Therefore, the fact that ITT decided to enlist for support from Washington<ref>Leacock, 86;Maurer, 329</ref>

The Brizola nationalizations became headline news in the American press when the [[John F. Kennedy]] administration was trying to counter the "Communist infiltration" in Brazil<ref>Maurer, 329</ref> by striking a deal with Goulart that included U.S. financial aid to the Brazilian federal government.<ref>Jeffrey Taffet, ''Foreign Aid as Foreign Policy: The Alliance for Progress in Latin America''. New York, Routledge, 2007, {{ISBN|0-415-97770-3}}, Chapter 5</ref> In this context, Brizola's actions became a diplomatic embarrassment, which turned Brizola's State government into an intended target of the [[Hickenlooper Amendment]].<ref>Leacock, 85 ; [[CIA]] released document,13th. July 1962, available at [http://www.faqs.org/cia/docs/88/0000585281/CIWR:-BRAZIL.html]</ref><ref>[[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.|Arthur Schlesinger]], ''Robert Kennedy and His Times, Volume 1''. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1978, page 579</ref><ref>Noel Maurer, ''The Empire Trap'',329/330</ref> Goulart gave in to American pressure on the issue, accepting to pay what the Left considered excessive compensations to both ITT & Amforp in exchange for financial aid, Brizola presented his in-law as a defector from the nationalist cause.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Through his domestic and foreign politics, Brizola became a major player in Brazilian politics, eventually developing presidential aspirations he could not legally fulfill at the time; Brazilian law did not allow close relatives of the acting President to stand for the following term of office. Between 1961 and 1964, Brizola acted as the radical wing of the independent left, where he pressured the office for an agenda of radical social and political reforms and for a change in the electoral legislation that allowed for his presidential candidacy in 1965. He was seen as personally authoritarian and quarrelsome, and capable of dealing with his enemies using physical aggression; for example he hit rightwing journalist David Nasser at Rio de Janeiro airport.<ref>Be it said, however, that Nasser was known at the time by his lack of scruples ("A reactionary to the marrow, who used his privileged condition&nbsp;... to work for the worst causes" – João Aveline, ''Macaco preso para interrogatório: retrato de uma época'', Porto Alegre, AGE, 1999, page 131, available at [https://books.google.com/books?id=ccoRK18Wt4QC&pg=PA131&dq=leonel+brizola+David+Nasser&hl=en&ei=b0bLS-f_FMiSuAeg8rSKBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=leonel%20brizola%20David%20Nasser&f=false]) and had been heaping vitriol on Brizola, by calling him, among other things, a "halfwit" (''boçal'') who " had learned to read in the Southern wind at the university of horse thieves": Cf. Luís Maklouf,''Cobras criadas: David Nasser e '''O Cruzeiro''' '', São Paulo: Editora SENAC, {{ISBN|85-7359-212-5}}, page 424</ref> Brizola acted as an adventurer in the political game around the Goulart government, being feared and hated by the political moderate Left and Right. This role was especially visible when Brizola moved his constituency from Rio Grande do Sul to a national political center, winning a landslide victory (269,384 ballots or a quarter of the State's electorate)<ref>Mauro Osório, ''Rio nacional Rio local: mitos e visões da crise carioca e fluminense''. Rio de Janeiro: SENAC, 2005, page 97</ref> in the 1962 election to Congress as a representative for the State of [[Guanabara (state)|Guanabara]]—the Rio de Janeiro municipality reorganized as a city-state after the national capital had been moved to Brasilia. A layer of lore quickly developed around Brizola's efforts to "steal" his brother-in-law's Goulart "political thunder".<ref>R.S. Rose, ''The Unpast'', 55</ref>

===Radical leadership and friction with Goulart (1963–1964)===

[[File:João Goulart e Leonel Brizola.jpg|thumb|Brizola (right) with his brother-in-law President [[João Goulart]] in early 1960s.]]
Goulart had been sworn as President in 1961 by means of a compromise, in which he was head of State in a [[parliamentary system]]. On 6 January 1963, however, a [[plebiscite]] scheduled earlier restored Goulart to the position of head of government and extinguished the cabinet.<ref>Jan Knippers Black, ''United States Penetration of Brazil''. The University of Pennsylvania Press, 1977, {{ISBN|0-7190-0699-6}}, page 26</ref> At the same time, in a move to vye with Goulart for political leadership, Brizola started a weekly Friday talkshow on the Rio radio broadcast Mayrink Veiga that was owned by Congressman from São Paulo State Miguel Leuzzi,<ref>Leite Filho & Neiva Moreira, ''El Caudillo Leonel Brizola'', 251. Leuzzi was a Congressman for the PTN (National Labor Party), a smaller sister party to the PTB</ref> which he used to broadcast nationwide, and planned to constitute a network of political cells composed of small groups of armed men; the "elevensome" ''Grupos de Onze''—paramilitary parties modeled on a soccer team.<ref>Cf. [[Thomas Skidmore]], ''Brazil: de Getúlio a Castelo'', Portuguese translation of ''Politics in Brazil 1930–1964''. Rio de Janeiro: Paz e Terra, 1982, pages 340/341. Leacock, ''Requiem for Revolution'', 151, however, adds that the "elevensome" existed mostly in Brizola's imagination, that they represented "political theater more than anything else"</ref> These were supposed to act as grassroots organizations that would "defend and diffuse" the chief points of a reformist agenda that would have to be achieved "by hook or by crook" (''na lei ou na marra'').<ref>Marcelo Ridenti, ''O fantasma da Revolução Brasileira''. São Paulo: UNESP, 1993, {{ISBN|85-7139-050-9}}, page 26</ref> Brizola's using of metaphors from the world of soccer was one of the instances of his apt rhetoric, that rendered him at the time a master of the broadcasts.<ref>Paulo Fontes, Bernardo Buarque de Hollanda, eds., ''The Country of Football: Politics, Popular Culture, and the Beautiful Game in Brazil''. London: Hurst, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1-84904-417-2}}, page 217n</ref> So apt, actually, as to make the whole of contemporary political specter to fear his bid at preeminence: in the words of a contemporary journalist, "Brizola was willing to pay any price to retain the ball" (''ser o dono da bola'').<ref>Edmar Morél, ''O golpe começou em Washington''. Rio de Janeiro: Civilização Brasileira, 1965, page 64.</ref>

Brizola's posturing and rhetoric seemed to justify the classification developed by Goulart's Foreign Minister and leader of the moderate left, [[San Tiago Dantas]]: Brizola was a paragon of a "negative left" which, in its uncompromising, ideological defense of social reform, forsook any compromise with democratic institutions.<ref>''Apud'' Gabriel da Fonseca Onofre, "San Tiago Dantas e a Frente Progressista (1963–1964)". XIV Encontro Regional da ANPUH-Rio, 2010, {{ISBN|978-85-609790-8-0}}</ref> Dantas' aversion to Brizola was reciprocated: Dantas and Goulart's War Minister General Amaury Kruel and Commerce Minister Antônio Balbino formed an "anti-reformist tripod" of "traitors to the national interests".<ref>[[John W. F. Dulles]], ''Unrest in Brazil: Political-Military Crises 1955-1964''. Austin: University of Texas Press, 2014, {{ISBN|978-0-292-77170-3}}, Book VI, 2</ref> Dantas, who negotiated the 1963 U.S.-Brazil financial agreement, had been received in Washington "more like a head of state than a minister of finance", and expected to be greeted at his homecoming "with appreciation if not fanfare"; a hope Brizola quickly dashed with "venomous attacks".<ref>Bruce L.R. Smith, ''Lincoln Gordon: Architect of Cold War Foreign Policy''. University Press of Kentucky, 2015, {{ISBN|978-0-8131-5655-2}}, pages 252/253</ref>

Notwithstanding his alleged radicalism, Brizola was not an ideologue or doctrinnaire.<ref>Skidmore, ''Brasil de Gatulio a Castelo'', 304</ref> Generally, he stood for an extreme Left Nationalism; land reform,<ref>In 1963, Brizola, as leader of the nationalist caucus in the House of Representatives, presented a bill for a comprehensive land reform project, which proposed paying indemnities to expropriated landowners by means of government bonds; cf. João Pedro Stédile, Douglas Estevam, eds., ''A questão agrária no Brasil: Programas de reforma agrária, 1946–2003'' . São Paulo: Expressão Popular, 2005, {{ISBN|85-87394-71-1}}, page 81</ref> extension of a franchise for illiterates and NCOs; and for tight controls over foreign investment that caused the American ambassador to Brazil, [[Lincoln Gordon]], to dislike Brizola and compare his propaganda techniques with those of [[Joseph Goebbels]];<ref>''New York Times'', 23rd. May 1963, ''apud'' Skidimore, ''Brasil de Getúlio a Castelo'', 304</ref> a mood mirrored by most of contemporary American media.<ref>In the ''Time Magazine'' issue of 19th of July 1963, he was called "Latin America's noisiest leftist South of Cuba". Cf.

In late 1963, after the failure of a conservative plan of economic adjustment (''Plano Trienal'') devised by the Ministry of Planning [[Celso Furtado]], Brizola involved himself in a bid for power by toppling Goulart's economically conservative Minister of Finance [[Carvalho Pinto]] to take the post himself.

==Exile and return (1964–1979)==

In April 1964, a [[coup d'état]] overthrew Goulart. Brizola was the only political leader to support for the president, sheltering him in [[Porto Alegre]] and hoping a bid to rouse the local army units towards the restoration of the toppled régime could be made. Brizola engaged himself in schemes to confront the military [[putschist]]s, including giving a fiery public speech at the Porto Alegre City Hall, exhorting army NCOs to "occupy barracks and arrest the generals",<ref>Leite Filho, ''El caudillo Leonel Brizola'', 275</ref><ref>David R.

===U.S. rescue from Uruguay, exile in the U.S. and Europe (1977–1979)===

Since the beginning of his exile, Brizola had been closely watched by Brazilian intelligence, who pressured the Uruguayan government on a regular basis.<ref>Ananda Simões Fernandes, "AS AÇÕES DA POLÍCIA POLÍTICA DURANTE A DITADURA CONTRA OS EXILADOS BRASILEIROS NO URUGUAI: O CASO DO DEPARTAMENTO DE ORDEM POLÍTICA E SOCIAL DO RIO GRANDE DO SUL".

According to recent declassified Brazilian diplomatic documents, on 20 September 1977, Brizola and his wife went to [[Buenos Aires]], from where they flew to the U.S. Buenos Aires was a dangerous place for Latin American exiles; the Brizolas were followed by American CIA agents and stayed overnight in a CIA safe house and  boarded a nonstop flight to [[New York City]] on September 22.<ref>''Folha de S.

In the late 1970s. the Brazilian military dictatorship was waning; in 1978, passports were quietly given to prominent political exiles but Brizola, alongside a core group of alleged radicals described as "public enemy number one", remained blacklisted and was refused the right of return.<ref>João Trajano Sento-Sé.

==Late ''Brizolismo'' (1979–1989)==

[[File:Dilma Rousseff Leonel Brizola.png|thumb|right|[[Dilma Rousseff]], then a founding member of the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]], with Brizola.]]

Brizola returned to Brazil with the intention of restoring the [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|Brazilian Labour Party]] as a radical, nationalist, left-wing, mass movement and as a confederacy of historical [[Vargoism|Vargoist]] leaders. He was hampered in this by the emergence of new grassroots movements, such as the new trade unionism centered around the São Paulo metalworkers and their leader [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], and the Catholic grassroots organizations of the rural poor spawned by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (CNBB). Brizola was denied the right to use the historical name of the Brazilian Labour Party, previously conceded to a rival group centered around a military dictatorship-friendly figure, Congresswoman [[Ivete Vargas]]—the grand-niece of Getúlio Vargas.<ref>Sento Sé, ''Brizolismo'', 89/96</ref> Instead, Brizola
founded an entirely new party, the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]] (Partido Democrático Trabalhista, PDT).<ref>Riordan Roett, ''Brazil: politics in a patrimonial society ''.

Brizola quickly restored his political prominence in Rio Grande do Sul and gained political pre-eminence in the State of Rio de Janeiro, where he sought a new basis of political support. Instead of associating himself with the organized working class—either by means of corporatist trade unionism or by vying with Lula and the WP for the support of the new trade unionism—Brizola sought a basis of support among the unorganized urban poor by means of an ideological tie-in between traditional radical nationalism and a charismatic [[Lumpenproletariat|lumpen]]-friendly populism, in what one scholar called "the aesthetics of the ugly".<ref>Sento Sé, ''Brizolismo'', Chapter III</ref> For his opponents, Brizola and his ''Brizolismo'' stood for shady deals with the "dangerous", resentful, "overrebellious" underclasses;<ref>Alba Zaluar, Marcos Alvito, eds., ''1 século de favela''. Rio de Janeiro: FGV, 1988, {{ISBN|85-225-0253-6}}, page 41</ref> for his supporters, they stood for the paternalistic empowerment of the destitute—the lowest, least organized and poorest of the working classes. According to Sento Sé, "Politics, from a ''Brizolista'' viewpoint, is above all to assume a radical option for the poor and the meek".<ref>Sento Sé, ''Brizolismo'', 163</ref>

Brizola shunned the class-based, [[corporatist]] character of his early [[populism]] and adopted a Christian rhetoric of friendship to the people in general—akin to the Russian [[narodnik]]s<ref>"As much as the narodnicks turned towards the peasants, ''brizolistas'' turned themselves towards shantytown dwellers and outcasts of all hues" -Sento Sé, ''Brizolismo'', 194</ref> than to classical Latin American populism.<ref>Sento Sé, ''Brizolismo'', 193</ref> This new radical populism was seen as a threat to more orderly, liberal-democratic politics.<ref>Henry Avery Dietz, Gil Shidlo, eds., ''Urban Elections in Democratic Latin America''. Wilmington, DE, Rowman & Littlefield, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8420-2627-4}}, page 284</ref> It suffered from a lacking mastery of less personal mass politics techniques and required Brizola's charismatic and personal leadership of Brizola to function effectively. In Brizola's absence—or that of his persona—<ref>"If, on one side, bureaucratic logic imposes&nbsp;... a routinization of charisma, as posed by [[Max Weber]], on the other side Brizola's movement achieved, in Rio de Janeiro, a kind of enchantment of bureaucracy, even in its routine working" – Sento Sé, ''Brizolismo'', 197</ref> the PDT could not become a contender to power, hampering its development on the national level.<ref>Kurt von Mettenheim, ''The Brazilian Voter: Mass Politics in Democratic Transition, 1974–1986''. University of Pittsburgh Press, 1995,  page 122</ref>

In 1982, Brizola stood for governor of the State of Rio de Janeiro in the first free, direct, gubernatorial elections in that state since 1965. He ran a ticket of candidates for Congress that tried to compensate for his party's lack of cadres by offering a roster of people with no previous ties to professional politics, such as the Native Brazilian leader [[Mário Juruna]], the singer [[Agnaldo Timóteo]], and a sizeable number of Afro-Brazilian activists.<ref>Ana Lucia Araujo, ''Public Memory of Slavery: Victims and Perpetrators in the South Atlantic''. Amhrest, NY, Cambria Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-60497-714-1}}, page 221</ref> He was aware that this last foray into race politics contradicted his previous,  more conventionally radical policies. Brizola nicknamed his ideology ''Socialismo Moreno'' ("Socialism of Color" or "mixed-race socialism").<ref>Rebecca Lynn Reichmann, ed., ''Race in Contemporary Brazil: From Indifference to Inequality''. Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-271-01905-0}}, page 15</ref> Brizola centered his personal campaign on issues such as education and public security, offering a candidacy that had clear, oppositional overtones and proposed to upheld the Vargoist legacy. By developing a nucleus of combative militants around himself—the so-called ''Brizolândia''—Brizola led a campaign that melded violent confrontations and street brawls with a paradoxically festive mood,<ref>Sento Sé, ''Brizolismo'', 224/227</ref> expressed by the motto ''Brizola na cabeça''—a pun between "Brizola at the head of the ticket" and "High on Brizola", ''brisola'' being a contemporary slang for a small parcel of cocaine.<ref>Maria Alves, Philip Evanson, ''Living in the Crossfire: Favela Residents, Drug Dealers, and Police Violence  in Rio de Janeiro''.

To have his victory in the 1982 elections acknowledged, Brizola had to publicly denounce what the paper ''Jornal do Brasil''<ref>"Há 30 anos, 'JB' revelou escândalo do Proconsult e derrubou fraude na eleição". ''Jornal do Brasil'', online edition, 27 November 2012, [http://www.jb.com.br/pais/noticias/2012/11/27/ha-30-anos-jb-revelou-escandalo-do-proconsult-e-derrubou-fraude-na-eleicao/].

Porto Alegre: L&PM, 1989, page 55</ref>

Brizola then proceeded to keep and expanded his nationwide political visibility during his controversial first term as governor of Rio (1983–1987). He developed his early education policies on a grander scale with an ambitious programme of construction of large high-school buildings, the so-called CIEPs ("Integrated Centers for Public Education") whose architect was [[Oscar Niemeyer]]. The schools were intended to be open all day, providing food and recreational activities to students. Brizola also developed policies for providing public services and recognized housing property for dwellers in shanty towns. Brizola opposed policies for shantytowns based on forcible resettlement to housing projects, and instead proposed—in the words of his chief adviser [[Darcy Ribeiro]], that "shanty towns are not part of the problem, but part of the solution" - a "bizarre" solution, but nevertheless one that "allowed shanty people to be near to their working places and live as a regular human community".<ref>Darcy Ribeiro, ''O povo brasileiro: A formação e o sentido do Brasil''.

Brizola also adopted a radical new policy for police action in the poor suburbs and [[favela]]s in the [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[metropolitan area]]. Alleging old relations and modus operandi were founded on repression, conflict and disrespect, he ordered the state police to refrain from random raids in favelas and repressed the activities of vigilante death squads that included policemen on leave.<ref>cf.

It was alleged that gangs had originated through the association of convicted petty criminals and leftist political prisoners in the 1970s. Other scholars argue that this "politicization" of common crime had been the work of the military dictatorship, which, by incarcerating together common criminals and political prisoners, offered the former the opportunity to mimic the organization strategies of underground resistance groups.<ref>Lauren Joseph, Matthew Mahler, Javier Auyero, eds., ''New Perspectives in Political Ethnography''.

Amid the economic crisis and rampant inflation of 1980s Brazil, many conservative observers took Brizola as chief radical bogey—a throwback to 1960s populism.<ref>Donald V. Coes, ''Macroeconomic Crises, Policies, and Growth in Brazil, 1964–90''. World Bank Publications, 1995, {{ISBN|0-8213-2299-0}}, page 56</ref> Brizola, as the left in general at the time, sought an accommodation with ruling elites by avoiding taking a firm position on issues such as land reform and nationalization of private banking systems, therefore qualifying for taking power through elections.<ref>James F. Petras, Morris H. Morley, ''US Hegemony Under Siege: Class, Politics, and Development in Latin America''. London: Verso, 1990, {{ISBN|0-86091-280-9}}, page 10</ref> From the viewpoint of mass electoral politics, it was during the 1989 presidential election Brizola's charismatic leadership exposed its shortcomings when he finished the first run third, losing the second position that would have qualified him for a runoff, by a narrow margin to [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], whose [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] had the cadres, the professional activism and the penetration of the organized social movements that Brizola's lacked.<ref>Jacky Picard, ed. ''Le Brésil de Lula: Les défis d'un socialisme démocratique à la périphérie du capitalisme''. Paris: Khartala, 2003, page 81</ref> [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] was eventually elected in the runoff. Brizola carried the first-round elections regionally, winning huge majorities in Rio Grande do Sul and in Rio de Janeiro State, but only received 1.4% of the votes from [[São Paulo state]].<ref>Mettenheim, ''The Brazilian Voter'', 122</ref> Lula used his stronghold in the most industrialized areas of the Southeast as a springboard and gathered new voters in the Northeast, where Brizola was practically a no-show candidate. Lula won the right to stand against Collor in the runoff elections, surpassing Brizola by a mere 0.6% of the electorate.<ref>André Singer, ''Esquerda e direita no eleitorado brasileiro: a identificação ideológica nas disputas presidenciais de 1989 e 1994''.

Brizola was a staunch supporter of Lula's candidacy in the 1989 run-off elections, which he justified with a declaration before PDT cronies that became part of Brazilian political lore: "I will be candid: a politician from the old school, Senator [[Pinheiro Machado]] once said that politics is the art of swallowing toads (''engolir sapo''). Wouldn't that be fascinating to force-feed Brazilian élites and having them to swallow the Bearded Toad, Lula?"<ref>[http://www.fazenda.gov.br/resenhaeletronica/MostraMateria.asp?cod=305962 Brazilian Finace Ministry electronic news clipping]</ref> Brizola's support was crucial in increasing votes for Lula in Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul, where Lula passed from a first round 12.2% in Rio de Janeiro and 6.7% in Rio Grande to a second round 72.9% in Rio and 68.7% in Rio Grande.<ref>Wendy Hunter, ''The Transformation of the Workers' Party in Brazil, 1989–2009''.

==Political decline and death (1989–2004)==

After the 1989 election there were still chances Brizola could achieve his dream of winning the Presidency if he could overcome his party's lack of national penetration. Some of his advisers proposed him a candidacy to the Senate in the ensuing 1990 elections, which could offer him national highlights. Brizola refused, preferring to present himself as a candidate to the gubernatorial elections in the same year, winning a second term as Governor of Rio de Janeiro by a first-round majority of 60.88% of all valid ballots.<ref>Sento Sé, ''Brizolismo'', 232</ref> Brizola's second term as Rio's governor was a political failure, marked by instances of disorganized management caused by Brizola's ultra-centralism and distaste for proper bureaucratic procedure and the support Brizola eventually offered to the Collor administration in exchange for funds for public works. Brizola was charged with collaborating with the embezzlement schemes that led to Collor's 1992 impeachment.<ref>Sento Sé, ''Brizolismo'', 263/264</ref>

Bereft of national support and forsaken by close associates such as [[Cesar Maia]] and [[Anthony Garotinho]], who abandoned Brizola for the sake of their personal careers, Brizola again ran for president on the PDT's ticket, amid the success of Minister of Finance and presidential candidate [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]]'s anti-inflation [[Plano Real]]. The 1994 presidential elections were a failure for Brizola, who scored fifth place. Cardoso was elected in the first round by an absolute majority.<ref>Sento Sé, ''Brizolismo'', 294</ref> It was the end of ''Brizolismo'' as a national political force; some weeks before the election, a kiosk in downtown Rio de Janeiro where ''Brizolandia'' cronies met was demolished by City Hall officers and was never rebuilt.<ref>Sento-Sé, ''Brizolismo'', 346</ref> During Cardoso's first term, Brizola remained a critic of his [[neoliberal]] policies of privatization of public companies, saying in 1995, "if there is no civil reaction to privatization, there will be a military one".<ref>Larry Diamond, Marc F. Plattner, Philip J. Costopoulos, eds.,''Debates on Democratization'', The Johns Hopkins University Press / [[National Endowment for Democracy]], 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-9776-4}}, page 49, note 6</ref> When Cardoso ran for re-election four years later, Brizola contented himself with a Vice Presidential candidacy on Lula's ticket, and both lost to Cardoso.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In his final years, Brizola's fractured relationship with Lula and the Workers' Party changed; he refused to support them in the first round of the 2002 presidential election, supporting instead the candidacy of [[Ciro Gomes]] for president, while contesting a seat in the Senate. Gomes finished third, Lula was elected president, and Brizola lost his bid for the Senate, bringing an end to his regional force. Brizola supported Lula in the second round of the 2002 election, therefore qualifying for joining with other pre-eminent political figures. He came to be regarded as a veteran of leftist popularism and a secondary character in his last two years.<ref>Svenja Schell, ''Die Geschichte der brasilianischen Arbeiterpartei 'Partido dos Trabalhadores' ''. GRIN Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-640-61812-5}}, page 20</ref> Despite supporting Lula at some periods during his first term, at his last public appearances Brizola criticized Lua for what he termed neoliberalist policies and for neglecting traditional left-wing and workers' struggles. Brizola's late comments on Lula took on a personal character. During May 2004, he was one of the sources for a [[Larry Rohter]] story on Lula's alleged alcoholism; he told a ''New York Times'' correspondent about having advised Lula "to get hold of this thing and control it".<ref>"Brazilian Leader's Tippling Becomes National Concern". ''New York Times'', May 09 2004, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/09/world/brazilian-leader-s-tippling-becomes-national-concern.html]. Retrieved June 01 2013</ref>

Brizola died on June 21, 2004, after a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. He planned to run for the Presidency in 2006 and, although ailing,<ref>Leite Filho, ''El Caudillo Leonel Brizola'', 517</ref> had just received his former associate [[Anthony Garotinho]] and his wife [[Rosinha Garotinho]] the day before.<ref>''The Guardian'' obituary, 23 June 2004, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jun/23/guardianobituaries.brazil]. Retrieved June 01 2013</ref>

On December 29, 2015, a congressional bill was approved by President Dilma Rousseff inscribing Brizola's name in the Book of Heroes of the Motherland, the official registry of all deceased Brazilians "who offered their lives to the Motherland, her defense and building, with exceptional commitment and heroism".<ref>''O Globo'' December 29, 2015.
