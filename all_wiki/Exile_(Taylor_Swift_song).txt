"'''Exile'''" (stylized in [[Letter case#All lowercase|all lowercase]]) is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]], featuring American indie-folk band [[Bon Iver]]. It is the fourth track on Swift's eighth studio album, ''[[Folklore (Taylor Swift album)|Folklore]]'' (2020), released on July 24, 2020, through [[Republic Records]]. The song was written by Swift, [[Joe Alwyn]] (under the pseudonym William Bowery) and [[Justin Vernon]], and produced by [[Aaron Dessner]]. It was serviced to [[alternative radio]] stations as a single on August 3, 2020. Depicting an unspoken dialogue between two estranged lovers, "Exile" is a cinematic [[Indie folk|indie-folk]] [[ballad]] with [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[orchestra]]l elements, that combines Swift's honeyed vocals and Vernon's deep [[baritone]] into a melancholic [[duet]] propelled by a plodding [[piano]], swirling [[String (music)|strings]] and soaring [[harmonies]]. 

Upon release, "Exile" garnered widespread critical acclaim, with praise towards the duo's vocal chemistry, the agonizing lyricism, rich instrumentals and bleak atmosphere. [[Music critics]] picked it as a standout on ''Folklore'', and named it one of Swift's best collaborations to-date, comparing it to her 2012 single "[[Safe & Sound (Taylor Swift song)|Safe & Sound]]". "Exile" is nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] at the [[63rd Grammy Awards]].

"Exile" debuted at number six on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], giving Swift her twenty-eighth top-10 hit and eighteenth top-10 debut in the United States. It reached top-tier positions globally, charting inside the top five in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand; top ten in Canada, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Kingdom; top 20 in Israel and Scotland; and top 40 in Belgium, Portugal and Sweden. "Exile" marked either Bon Iver's highest-peaking song or their first top-10 hit in the countries it charted in.

==Background and release==
All tracks of ''Folklore'' were conceived by Swift as imageries and visuals inside her head, a result of her imagination "running wild" while isolating herself during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]; "Exile" rose out of one such imagery—a [[exile]]d man, who is "walking the bluffs of a land that isn't his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong".<ref name="Primer">{{Cite web|date=July 24, 2020|title='It Started With Imagery': Read Taylor Swift's Primer For 'Folklore'|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9423740/read-taylor-swift-primer-folklore|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724184421/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9423740/read-taylor-swift-primer-folklore|archive-date=July 24, 2020|access-date=September 5, 2020|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> Upon release, the song featured a songwriting credit from  William Bowery, who had no online presence, and thus, was presumed to be a [[pseudonym]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Blistein|first=Jon|date=July 23, 2020|title=Hear Taylor Swift's New Album 'Folklore'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-new-album-folklore-release-date-1032962/|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725062452/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-new-album-folklore-release-date-1032962/|archive-date=July 25, 2020|accessdate=July 29, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|date=July 23, 2020|title=Taylor Swift Was Bummed About Her Summer Plans Not Panning Out, So She's Releasing A New Album...

Michael Sumsion of ''[[PopMatters]]'' proclaimed "Exile" an "obvious standout" on ''Folklore'', defining it as a mournful examination of dissolution that juxtaposes Vernon's low [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] [[Register (music)|register]] with Swift's "mid-range, conversational cadences and sharp-eyed observation to thrilling effect". He noted that the song begins as a "plaintive hush", growing into "a gleaming swarm of [[Orchestral music|orchestral]]-[[Gospel music|gospel]]-flavored [[Testimony|testifying]] that suggests the physical space of a [[cathedral]]", all whilst radiating a rich swell. Sumsion commented that "Exile" could easily fit on ''[[I, I]]'', Bon Iver's fourth studio album.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Sumsion|first=Michael|date=July 29, 2020|title=Taylor Swift Abandons Stadium-Pop for a New Tonal Approach on 'Folklore'|url=https://www.popmatters.com/taylor-swift-folklore-review-2646821264.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 24, 2020|website=[[PopMatters]]}}</ref> ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' writer Jody Rosen deemed the song a "stormy duet" and "a tortured [[Call and response (music)|call-and-response]] between estranged lovers", adding that the song hits hard because of its essence of reality.<ref name=":0" /> Justin Curto of ''[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]'' opined that Swift has been productive in [[COVID-19 pandemic|the pandemic]], creating her most contemplative album yet, with "Exile" as a prime result.<ref name="Vulture" />
