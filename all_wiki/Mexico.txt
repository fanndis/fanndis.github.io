[[Pre-Columbian Mexico]] traces its origins to 8,000 BC and is identified as one of six [[Cradle of civilization|cradles of civilization]];<ref>{{cite web|website=Mapscaping|title=MAPPED: THE 6 CRADLES OF CIVILIZATION|url=https://mapscaping.com/blogs/geo-candy/mapped-the-6-cradles-of-civilization|date=8 May 2018|access-date=13 July 2019}}</ref> it was home to many advanced [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations, most well known among them the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and the [[Aztec]]s. In 1521, the [[Spanish Empire]] [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquered and colonized]] the territory from its base in [[Mexico City]], which then became known as [[New Spain]]. The [[Catholic Church]] played an important role as millions of indigenous inhabitants converted. These populations were heavily exploited to mine rich deposits of precious material, which became a major source of wealth for the Spanish.<ref>Archer, Christon I. "Military: Bourbon New Spain" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 898-900.</ref> Mexico became an independent [[nation state]] after the successful [[Mexican War of Independence]] against Spain in 1821.<ref name="hist">{{cite web|website=The History Channel|title=History of Mexico|url=https://www.history.com/topics/mexico/history-of-mexico|date=9 November 2009|access-date=15 July 2019}}</ref>

The [[Texas Revolution|War of Texas Independence]] in 1836 and the [[Mexican–American War]] led to huge [[Territorial evolution of Mexico|territorial losses]] in Mexico's sparsely populated north, contiguous to the United States. The newly instituted [[La Reforma|reforms]] that granted protection to indigenous communities, and curtailed the power of the military and the church, were enshrined in the [[Constitution of 1857]]. This triggered the [[War of the Reform]] and [[French Intervention in Mexico|French intervention]]. [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian Habsburg]] was installed as [[Emperor of Mexico|emperor]] by France and [[Benito Juárez]] kept an opposing republican government in exile. The following decades were marked by instability and dictatorship of [[Porfirio Díaz]], who sought to modernize Mexico and restore order.<ref name="hist"/> The [[Porfiriato]] ended with the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910 and the winning [[Constitutionalist Army|Constitutionalist faction]] drafted a new [[Constitution of Mexico|1917 Constitution]]. The revolutionary generals of the winning northern faction dominated the 1920s and served as [[presidents of Mexico|presidents]], but the 1928 assassination of [[Alvaro Obregón]] led to the formation of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] in 1929, under which Mexico was a de facto [[one-party state]] until [[2000 Mexican general election|2000]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-election-pri/chronology-checkered-history-of-the-pris-rule-in-mexico-idUSBRE85R12C20120628 |last1=Rama |first1=Anahi |last2=Stargardter |first2=Gabriel |title=Chronology: Checkered history of the PRI's rule in Mexico |date= 28 June 2012 |website= Reuters }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/mexicos-history-of-one-party-rule/2012/01/15/gIQA0NVf1P_graphic.html |title=Mexico's history of one-party rule |date= 5 January 2012 |website= The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Padgett |first1= L.

{{lang|nah|[[Name of Mexico|Mēxihco]]}} is the [[Nahuatl]] term for the heartland of the [[Aztec Empire]], namely the [[Valley of Mexico]] and surrounding territories, with its people being known as the [[Mexica]].

The official name of the country has changed as the [[form of government]] has changed.

The earliest complex civilization in Mexico was the [[Olmec]] culture, which flourished on the Gulf Coast from around 1500 BC. Olmec cultural traits diffused through Mexico into other formative-era cultures in Chiapas, Oaxaca and the Valley of Mexico. The formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions, as well as artistic and architectural complexes.<ref>Diehl, Richard A. (2004).

The Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic [[Maya Script|Maya Hieroglyphic script]]. The earliest written histories date from this era.  The tradition of writing was important after the Spanish conquest in 1521.<ref>Sampson, Geoffrey; ''Writing Systems: A Linguistic Introduction'', Hutchinson (London), 1985.</ref>

In Central Mexico, the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of [[Teotihuacan|Teotihuacán]], which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the Maya area as well as north. Teotihuacan, with a population of more than 150,000 people, had some of the largest [[Mesoamerican pyramid|pyramidal structures]] in the pre-Columbian Americas.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cowgill |first1=George L. |title=State and Society at Teotihuacan, Mexico |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |date=21 October 1997 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=129–161 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.129 |oclc=202300854 |s2cid=53663189 }}</ref> After the collapse of Teotihuacán around 600 AD, competition ensued between several important political centers in central Mexico such as [[Xochicalco]] and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]]. At this time, during the Epi-Classic, [[Nahua people]]s began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of [[Oto-Manguean languages]].

During the early post-classic era (ca. 1000-1519 CE), Central Mexico was dominated by the [[Toltec]] culture, [[Oaxaca]] by the [[Mixtec civilization|Mixtec]], and the lowland Maya area had important centers at [[Chichén Itzá]] and [[Mayapán]].  Toward the end of the post-Classic period, the Mexica established dominance, establishing a political and economic empire based in the city of Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City), extending from central Mexico to the border with Guatemala.<ref>{{cite web|website=Ancient Civilizations World|title=Ancient Civilizations of Mexico|url=https://ancientcivilizationsworld.com/mexico/|date=12 January 2017|access-date=14 July 2019}}</ref> [[Alexander von Humboldt]] popularized the modern usage of "[[Aztec]]" as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade, custom, religion, and language to the [[Tenochtitlan|Mexica state]] and Ēxcān Tlahtōlōyān, the [[Aztec Empire|Triple Alliance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mexika.org/2014/05/31/the-word-azteca-was-not-created-by-von-humboldt/|website=Mexicka.org|title=The word "Azteca" was NOT created by Von Humboldt!|access-date=13 July 2019|date=31 May 2014}}</ref> In 1843, with the publication of the work of William H.

The Aztec empire was an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered territories; it was satisfied with the payment of tributes from them. It was a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected; for example, the southern peripheral zones of [[Soconusco|Xoconochco]] were not in direct contact with the center. The hegemonic nature of the Aztec empire was demonstrated by their restoration of local rulers to their former position after their city-state was conquered. The Aztec did not interfere in local affairs, as long as the tributes were paid.<ref>Berdan, ''et al.'' (1996), ''Aztec Imperial Strategies.''

===Conquest of the Aztec Empire (1519–1521)===

Although the Spanish had established colonies in the Caribbean starting in 1493, it was not until the second decade of the sixteenth century that they began exploring the coast of Mexico. The Spanish first learned of Mexico during the [[Juan de Grijalva]] expedition of 1518. The natives kept "repeating: ''Colua, Colua'', and ''Mexico, Mexico'', but we [explorers] did not know what ''Colua'' or ''Mexico'' meant", until encountering Montezuma's governor at the mouth of the [[Boca del Río, Veracruz|Rio de las Banderas]].<ref name=Diaz>Diaz, B., 1963, ''The Conquest of New Spain,'' London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}</ref>{{rp|33–36}}  The [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] began in February 1519 when [[Hernán Cortés]] landed on the Gulf Coast and founded the Spanish city of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]]. Around 500 [[conquistador]]es, along with horses, cannons, swords, and long guns gave the Spanish some technological advantages over indigenous warriors, but key to the Spanish victory was making strategic alliances with disgruntled indigenous city-states (''[[altepetl]]'') who supplied the Spaniards and fought with them against the Aztec Triple Alliance.  Also important to the Spanish victory was Cortés's cultural translator, Malinche, a Nahua woman enslaved in the Maya area whom the Spanish acquired as a gift.  She quickly learned Spanish and gave strategic advise about how to deal with both indigenous allies and indigenous foes.<ref>Townsend, Camilla. ''Malintzin's choices: An Indian woman in the conquest of Mexico''. New Mexico: University of New Mexico Press 2006.</ref>  The unconquered city-state of Tlaxcala allied with the Spanish against their enemies, the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan. The Spanish gained other indigenous allies, who also joined in the war for their own reasons.

When the Spaniards arrived, the ruler of the Aztec empire was [[Moctezuma II]], who after a delay allowed the Spanish to proceed inland to Tenochtitlan. The Spanish captured him, holding him hostage.  He died while in their custody and the Spanish retreated from Tenochtitlan in great disarray.

The 1521 capture Tenochtitlan and immediate founding of the Spanish capital [[Mexico City]] on its ruins was the beginning of a 300-year-long colonial era during which Mexico was known as ''Nueva España'' ([[New Spain]]). The [[Kingdom of New Spain]] was created from the remnants of the Aztec empire. The two pillars of Spanish rule were the State and the Roman Catholic Church, both under the authority of the Spanish crown. In 1493 the pope had granted [[Patronato real|sweeping powers]] to the Spanish crown, with the proviso that the crown spread Christianity in its new realms. In 1524, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]] created the [[Council of the Indies]] based in Spain to oversee State power its overseas territories; in New Spain the crown established a high court in Mexico City, the ''[[Real Audiencia]],'' and then in 1535 created the viceroyalty. The viceroy was highest official of the State. In the religious sphere, the diocese of Mexico was created in 1530 and elevated to the [[Archdiocese of Mexico]] in 1546, with the archbishop as the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, overseeing Roman Catholic clergy. Castilian Spanish was the language of rulers. The Catholic faith the only one permitted, with non-Catholics (Jews and Protestants) and Catholics (excluding Indians) holding unorthodox views being subject to the [[Mexican Inquisition]], established in 1571.<ref>Chuchiak, John F. IV, "Inquisition" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 704-708</ref>

In the first half-century of Spanish rule, a network of Spanish cities was created, sometimes on pre-Hispanic sites. The capital Mexico City was and remains the premier city. Cities and towns were hubs of civil officials, ecclesiastics, business, Spanish elites, and mixed-race and indigenous artisans and workers. When deposits of silver were discovered in sparsely populated northern Mexico, far from the dense populations of central Mexico, the Spanish secured the region against fiercely resistant indigenous [[Chichimeca War|Chichimecas]].  The Viceroyalty at its greatest extent included the territories of modern Mexico, Central America as far south as Costa Rica, and the western United States. The Viceregal capital Mexico City also administrated the [[Spanish West Indies]] (the [[Caribbean]]), the [[Spanish East Indies]] (that is, the [[Philippines]]), and [[Spanish Florida]]. In 1819, the Spain signed the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]] with the United States, setting New Spain's northern boundary.<ref>Salvucci, Linda. "Adams-Onís Treaty (1819)".

The population of Mexico was overwhelmingly indigenous and rural during the entire colonial period and beyond, despite the massive decrease in their numbers due to epidemic diseases. Diseases such as smallpox, measles, and others were introduced by Europeans and African slaves, especially in the sixteenth century.

The first census in Mexico (then known as [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]) that included an ethnic classification was the 1793 census. Also known as the Revillagigedo census. Most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost, thus most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works such as German scientist [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. Europeans ranged from 18% to 22% of New Spain's population, Mestizos from 21% to 25%, Indians from 51% to 61% and Africans were between 6,000 and 10,000. The total population ranged from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354. It is concluded that the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even, while the percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13%–17% per century, mostly due to the latter having higher mortality rates from living in remote locations and being in constant war with the colonists.<ref name=aleph>{{cite web |last1=Lerner |first1=Victoria |title=Consideraciones sobre la población de la Nueva España (1793–1810) |trans-title=Considerations on the population of New Spain (1793–1810) |url=http://aleph.org.mx/jspui/bitstream/56789/29809/1/17-067-1968-0327.pdf |publisher=El Colegia de México |location=Mexico City |language=es |access-date=4 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113062234/http://aleph.org.mx/jspui/bitstream/56789/29809/1/17-067-1968-0327.pdf |archive-date=13 November 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Independent-era Mexico eliminated the legal basis of the [[castas|Colonial caste system]] which led to exclusion of racial classification in the censuses to come.

Colonial [[Law in Spain|law with Spanish roots]] was introduced and attached to native customs creating a hierarchy between local jurisdiction (the [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildos]]) and the Spanish Crown. Upper administrative offices were closed to native-born people, even those of pure Spanish blood ([[Criollo people|criollos]]). Administration was based on the [[racial separation]]. Society was organized in a racial hierarchy, with whites on top, mixed-race persons and blacks in the middle, and indigenous at the bottom. There were formal legal designations of racial categories. The Republic of Spaniards (''República de Españoles'') comprised European- and American-born Spaniards, mixed-race [[casta]]s, and black Africans. The Republic of Indians (''República de Indios'') comprised the indigenous populations, which the Spanish lumped under the term Indian (''indio''), a Spanish colonial social construct which indigenous groups and individuals rejected as a category. Spaniards were exempt from paying tribute, Spanish men had access to higher education, could hold civil and ecclesiastical offices, were subject to the [[Mexican Inquisition|Inquisition]], and liable for military service when the standing military was established in the late eighteenth century. Indigenous paid tribute, but were exempt from the Inquisition, indigenous men were excluded from the priesthood; and exempt from military service.

Although the racial system appears fixed and rigid, there was some fluidity within it, and racial domination of whites was not complete.<ref name="Cope, R. Douglas 1994">Cope, R. Douglas.

The rich deposits of silver, particularly in [[Zacatecas]] and [[Guanajuato]], resulted in silver extraction dominating the economy of New Spain.

As a result of its trade links with Asia, the rest of the Americas, Africa and Europe and the [[Global silver trade from the 16th to 18th centuries|profound effect of New World silver]], central Mexico was one of the first regions to be incorporated into a [[globalized]] economy.

The ''[[Camino Real de Tierra Adentro]]'' connected Mexico City with the interior of New Spain. Mexican silver pesos became the first globally used currency.

Following Hidalgo's death, the leadership was assumed by [[Ignacio López Rayón]] and then by the priest [[José María Morelos]], who occupied key southern cities with the support of [[Mariano Matamoros]] and [[Nicolás Bravo]]. In one notable incident, Nicolas Bravo captured 200 royalist soldiers, whom Morelos ordered should be executed in revenge of the murder of Bravo's father.

In subsequent years, the insurgency was near collapse, but in 1820 [[Viceroy]] [[Juan Ruiz de Apodaca]] sent an army under the [[Criollo people|criollo]] general [[Agustín de Iturbide]] against the troops of [[Vicente Guerrero]] who had among his trusted soldiers, [[Filipino Mexicans]] who were concentrated in [[Guerrero]], a state later named after Vicente Guerrero himself and where the Mexican flag was first sewn. Chief among the Filipino-Mexican soldiers was General [[Isidoro Montes de Oca]] who defeated Royalist armies 3 times his force's size.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/456194/pdf|title=Filipinos in Nueva España: Filipino-Mexican Relations, Mestizaje, and Identity in Colonial and Contemporary Mexico|page=414|quote=According to Ricardo Pinzon, these two Filipino soldiers—Francisco Mongoy and Isidoro Montes de Oca—were so distinguished in battle that they are regarded as folk heroes in Mexico.

A provision of the [[Plan of Iguala]] of [[Agustín de Iturbide]] bringing about Mexican independence in 1821, also included Catholic exclusivity in the religious sphere. The [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]] declared that the official religion of the Republic would be Catholic.

Mexico's short recovery after the War of Independence was soon cut short again by the civil wars, foreign invasion and occupation, and institutional instability of the mid-19th century, which lasted until the government of [[Porfirio Díaz]] reestablished conditions that paved the way for economic growth. The conflicts that arose from the mid-1850s had a profound effect because they were widespread and made themselves perceptible in the vast rural areas of the countries, involved clashes between castes, different ethnic groups, and haciendas, and entailed a deepening of the political and ideological divisions between republicans and monarchists.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

===Mexican Empire and the Early Republic (1821–1855)===
{{Main|First Mexican Empire|First Mexican Republic|Centralist Republic of Mexico}}
[[File:Mexico's Territorial Evolution.png|thumb|The [[territorial evolution of Mexico]] after independence, noting the secession of [[Federal Republic of Central America|Central America]] (purple), [[Chiapas]] annexed from [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Guatemala]] (blue), losses to the U.S. (red, white and orange) and the reannexation of the [[Republic of Yucatán]] (red)]]

The first thirty-five years after Mexico's independence were marked by political instability and the changing form of the Mexican State, from a monarchy to a federated republic.  There were military coups d'état, foreign invasions, ideological conflict between Conservatives and Liberals, and [[Economic history of Mexico|economic stagnation]]. Catholicism remained the only permitted religious faith and the Catholic Church as an institution retained its [[fueros|special privileges]], prestige, and property, a bulwark of Conservatism. The army, another Conservative institution, also retained its privileges. Former Royal Army General Agustín de Iturbide, became regent, as newly independent Mexico sought a [[First Mexican Empire|constitutional monarch]] from Europe.  When no member of a European royal house desired the position, Iturbide himself was declared Emperor Agustín I. The young and weak United States was the first country to recognize Mexico's independence, sending an ambassador to the court of the emperor and sending a message to Europe via the [[Monroe Doctrine]] not to intervene in Mexico.  The emperor's rule was short (1822–23) and he was overthrown by army officers.<ref name="miranda"/>{{rp|87–88}}

The successful rebels established the [[First Mexican Republic]]. In 1824, a [[Constitution of 1824|constitution of a federated republic]] was promulgated and former insurgent general [[Guadalupe Victoria]] became the first president of the newly born republic.<ref name="miranda"/>{{rp|94–95}} Central America, including Chiapas, left the union. In 1829, former insurgent general and fierce Liberal [[Vicente Guerrero]], a signatory of the [[Plan de Iguala]] that achieved independence, became president in a disputed election. During his short term in office, April to December 1829, he abolished slavery. As a visibly mixed-race man of modest origins, Guerrero was seen by white political elites as an interloper.<ref>Hale, Charles A. ''Mexican Liberalism in the Age of Mora''.

[[File:Antonio López de Santa Anna, siglo XIX, óleo sobre tela.png|thumb|left|175px|General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]]]]
Mexico's ability to maintain its independence and establish a viable government was in question.  Spain attempted to [[Spanish attempts to reconquer Mexico|reconquer]] its former colony during the 1820s, but eventually recognized its independence.   France attempted to recoup losses it claimed for its citizens during Mexico's unrest and blockaded the Gulf Coast during the so-called [[Pastry War]] of 1838–39.<ref>Costeloe, Michael P. "Pastry War" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 4, p. 318. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref> Santa Anna lost a leg in combat during this conflict, which he used for political purposes. Emerging as a national hero in defending Mexico was creole army general, [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], who had participated in the overthrow of the emperor, fought the Spanish invasion, and came to dominate the politics for the next 25 years, until his own overthrow in 1855.

Mexico also contended with indigenous groups which controlled territory that Mexico claimed in the north.  The [[Comanche Wars|Comanche]] controlled a [[Comanchería|huge territory]] in the sparsely populated region of central and northern Texas.<ref>Weber, David J., ''The Mexican Frontier, 1821–1846: The American Southwest under Mexico,'' University of New Mexico Press, 1982</ref> Wanting to stabilize and develop the frontier, the Mexican government encouraged Anglo-American immigration into present-day Texas. The region bordered the United States, and was territory controlled by [[Comanches]]. There were few settlers from central Mexico moving to this remote and hostile territory. Mexico by law was a Catholic country; the Anglo Americans were primarily Protestant English speakers from the southern United States. Some brought their black slaves, which after 1829 was contrary to Mexican law. Santa Anna sought to centralize government rule, suspending the constitution and promulgating the [[Siete Leyes|Seven Laws]], which place power in his hands. When he suspended the 1824 Constitution, civil war spread across the country. Three new governments declared independence: the [[Republic of Texas]], the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] and the [[Republic of Yucatán]].<ref name="miranda"/>{{rp|129–137}}

The largest blow to Mexico was the U.S. invasion of Mexico in 1846 in the [[Mexican American War]]. Mexico lost much of its sparsely populated northern territory, sealed in the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].  Despite that disastrous loss, Conservative Santa Anna returned to the presidency yet again and then was ousted and exiled in the Liberal [[Revolution of Ayutla]].

===Liberal Reform, French Intervention, and Restored Republic (1855–1876)===
{{Main|Second Mexican Republic|La Reforma|Second Mexican Empire}}

The overthrow of Santa Anna and the establishment of a civilian government by Liberals allowed them to enact laws that they considered vital for Mexico's economic development. It was a prelude to more civil wars and yet another foreign invasion. The [[La Reforma|Liberal Reform]] attempted to modernize Mexico's economy and institutions along liberal principles. They promulgated a new [[constitution|Constitution of 1857]], separating Church and State, stripping the Conservative institutions of the Church and the military of their special privileges (''[[fueros]]''); mandating the sale of Church-owned property and sale of indigenous community lands, and secularizing education.<ref>Britton, John A. "Liberalism" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, 739</ref> Conservatives revolted, touching off [[War of the Reform|civil war]] between rival Liberal and Conservative governments (1858–61).

The Liberals defeated the Conservative army on the battlefield, but Conservatives sought another solution to gain power via foreign intervention by the French. Mexican conservatives asked Emperor [[Napoleon III]] to place a European monarch as head of state in Mexico. The French Army defeated the Mexican Army and placed Maximilian Hapsburg on the [[Second Mexican Empire|newly established throne]] of Mexico, supported by Mexican Conservatives and propped up by the French Army. The Liberal republic under [[Benito Juárez]] was basically a government in internal exile, but with the end of the Civil War in the U.S. in April 1865, that government began aiding the Mexican Republic. Two years later, the French Army withdrew its support, Maximilian remained in Mexico rather than return to Europe. Republican forces captured him and he was executed in Querétaro, along with two Conservative Mexican generals.  The "Restored Republic" saw the return of Juárez, who was "the personification of the embattled republic,"<ref>Hamnett, Brian. "Benito Juárez" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 719-20</ref> as president.

The Conservatives had been not only defeated militarily, but also discredited politically for their collaboration with the French invaders. Liberalism became synonymous with patriotism.<ref>Britton, "Liberalism" p. 740.</ref>  The Mexican Army that had its roots in the colonial royal army and then the army of the early republic was destroyed. New military leaders had emerged from the War of the Reform and the conflict with the French, most notably [[Porfirio Díaz]], a hero of the [[Battle of Puebla|Cinco de Mayo]], who now sought civilian power. Juárez won re-election in 1867, but was challenged by Díaz, who criticized him for running for re-election. Díaz then rebelled, crushed by Juárez.  Having won re-election, Juárez died in office of natural causes in July 1872, and Liberal [[Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada]] became president, declaring a "religion of state" for rule of law, peace, and order. When Lerdo ran for re-election, Díaz rebelled against the civilian president, issuing the [[Plan of Tuxtepec]]. Díaz had more support and waged guerrilla warfare against Lerdo.  On the verge of Díaz's victory on the battlefield, Lerdo fled from office, going into exile.<ref>Sullivan, Paul. "Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, pp. 736-38</ref> Another army general assumed the presidency of Mexico.

===Porfiriato (1876–1911)===
{{Main|Porfirio Díaz|Porfiriato}}
[[File:MetlacBridgeKahlo.JPG|thumb|right|The Metlac railway bridge, an example of engineering achievement that overcame geographical barriers and allowed efficient movement of goods and people. Photo by [[Guillermo Kahlo]]]]

After the turmoil in Mexico from 1810 to 1876, the 35-year rule of Liberal General [[Porfirio Díaz]] (r.1876-1911) allowed Mexico to rapidly modernize in a period characterized as one of "order and progress". The [[Porfiriato]] was characterized by economic stability and growth, significant foreign investment and influence, an expansion of the [[Rail transport in Mexico|railroad network]] and telecommunications, and investments in the arts and sciences.<ref>{{cite web|website=Inside Mexico.com|url=https://www.inside-mexico.com/el-porfiriato-en-mexico/|title=El Porfiriato en Mexico|date=2 February 2018|access-date=18 July 2019|author=Adela M. Olvera|language=es|trans-title=The Porfiriato in Mexico]]}}</ref> The period was also marked by economic inequality and political repression. Díaz knew the potential for army rebellions, and systematically downsized the expenditure for the force, rather expanding the [[rurales|rural police force]] under direct control of the president. Díaz did not provoke the Catholic Church, coming to a modus vivendi with it; but he did not remove the anticlerical articles from the 1857 Constitution. From the late nineteenth century [[Porfiriato]], Protestants began to make inroads in Mexico.

The government encouraged British and U.S. investment. Commercial agriculture developed in northern Mexico, with many investors from the U.S. acquiring vast ranching estates and expanding irrigated cultivation of crops. The Mexican government ordered a survey of land with the aim of selling it for development. In this period, many indigenous communities lost their lands and the men became [[landless]] wage earners on large landed enterprises (''[[hacienda]]s'').<ref>Hart, John Mason. ''Empire and Revolution: The Americans in Mexico since the Civil War''. Berkeley: University of California Press Du 2002</ref> British and U.S. investors developed extractive mining of copper, lead, and other minerals, as well as petroleum on the Gulf Coast. Changes in Mexican law allowed for private enterprises to own the subsoil rights of land, rather than continuing the colonial law that gave all subsoil rights to the State.  An industrial manufacturing sector also developed, particularly in textiles.  At the same time, new enterprises gave rise to an industrial work force, which began organizing to gain labor rights and protections.

As an integral aspect of the liberal project was secular education.

Díaz's long success did not include planning for a political transition beyond his own presidency. He made no attempt, however, to establish a family dynasty, naming no relative as his successor.  As the centennial of independence approached, Díaz gave an [[James Creelman|interview]] where he said he was not going to run in the 1910 elections, when he would be 80. Political opposition had been suppressed and there were few avenues for a new generation of leaders. But his announcement set off a frenzy of political activity, including the unlikely candidacy of the scion of a rich landowning family, [[Francisco I. Madero]]. Madero won a surprising amount of political support when Díaz changed his mind an ran in the election, jailing Madero. The September centennial celebration of independence was the last celebration of the Porfiriato. The Mexican Revolution starting in 1910 saw a decade of civil war, the "wind that swept Mexico."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brenner |first1=Anita |title=The Wind that Swept Mexico: The History of the Mexican Revolution of 1910–1942 |date=1 January 1984 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0292790247 |edition=New}}</ref>

The [[Mexican Revolution]] was a decade-long transformational conflict in Mexico, with consequences to this day.<ref>Benjamin, Thomas.  ''La Revolución: Mexico's Great Revolution as Memory, Myth, and History''. Austin: University of Texas Press 2000</ref> It saw uprisings against President Díaz, his resignation, an interim presidency, and the democratic election of a rich landowner, [[Francisco I. Madero]] in 1911. In [[Ten Tragic Days|February 1913]], a military coup d'état overthrew Madero's government, with the support of the U.S., resulted in Madero's murder by agents of [[Federal Army]] General [[Victoriano Huerta]]. A coalition of anti-Huerta forces in the North, the [[Constitutionalist Army]] overseen by [[Venustiano Carranza]], and a peasant army in the South under [[Emiliano Zapata]], defeated the Federal Army. In 1914 that army was dissolved as an institution. Following the revolutionaries' victory against Huerta, revolutionary armies sought to broker a peaceful political solution, but the coalition splintered, plunging Mexico into civil war again. Constitutionalist general [[Pancho Villa]], commander of the Division of the North, broke with Carranza and allied with Zapata. Carranza's best general, [[Alvaro Obregón]], defeated Villa, his former comrade-in-arms in the [[battle of Celaya]] in 1915, and Villa's forces melted away. Carranza became the de facto head of Mexico, and the U.S. recognized his government. In 1916, the winners met at a constitutional convention to draft the [[Constitution of 1917]], which was ratified in February 1917. Said Constitution strengthened the anticlerical provisions that were carried over from the 1857 Constitution.<ref>Matute, Alvaro.

The U.S. has had a history of inference and intervention in Mexico, most notably the Mexican-American War. During the Revolution, the [[William Howard Taft|Taft]] administration supported the Huerta coup against Madero, but when [[Woodrow Wilson]] was inaugurated as president in March 1913, it refused to recognize Huerta's regime and allowed arms sales to the Constitutionalists. Wilson ordered troops to [[United States occupation of Veracruz|occupy]] the strategic port of Veracruz in 1914, which was lifted.<ref>{{cite web|website=Library of Congress|title=The Mexican Revolution and the United States in the Collections of the Library of Congress, U.S. Involvement Before 1913 |url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/mexican-revolution-and-the-united-states/us-involvement-before-1913.html|access-date=18 July 2019}}</ref> After Pancho Villa was defeated by revolutionary forces in 1915, he led a raid into [[Columbus, New Mexico]] incursion, prompting the U.S. to send [[Pancho Villa Expedition|10,000 troops]] led by General [[John J.

Consolidating power, President Carranza had peasant-leader Emiliano Zapata assassinated in 1919.<ref name="miranda"/>{{rp|312}}  Carranza had gained support of the peasantry during the Revolution, but once in power he did little to distribute land, and, in fact, returned some confiscated land to their original owners. President Carranza's best general, Obregón, served briefly in Carranza's administration, but returned to his home state of Sonora to position himself to run in the 1920 presidential election. Carranza chose a political and revolutionary no-body to succeed him. Obregón and two other Sonoran revolutionary generals drew up the [[Plan of Agua Prieta]], overthrowing Carranza, who died fleeing Mexico City in 1920. General [[Adolfo de la Huerta]] became interim president, followed the election of General [[Álvaro Obregón]].

===Political consolidation and one-party rule (1920–2000)===
{{See|Institutional Revolutionary Party}}
[[File:PRI logo (Mexico).svg|thumb|left|200px|Logo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which incorporates the colors of the Mexican flag]]
The first quarter-century of the post-revolutionary period (1920-1946) was characterized by revolutionary generals serving as [[Presidents of Mexico]], including [[Álvaro Obregón]] (1920–24), [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] (1924-28), [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] (1934–40), and [[Manuel Avila Camacho]] (1940–46). Since 1946, no member of the military has been President of Mexico. The post-revolutionary project of the Mexican government sought to bring order to the country, end military intervention in politics, and create organizations of interest groups. Workers, peasants, urban office workers, and even the army for a short period were incorporated as sectors of the single party that dominated Mexican politics from its founding in 1929.

Obregón instigated land reform and strengthened the power of organized labor. He gained recognition from the United States and took steps to [[American-Mexican Claims Commission|settle claims]] with companies and individuals that lost property during the Revolution. He imposed his fellow former Sonoran revolutionary general, Calles, as his successor, prompting an unsuccessful military revolt. As president Calles provoked a [[Cristero War|major conflict]] with the [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Catholic Church]] and Catholic guerrilla armies when he strictly enforced anticlerical articles of the 1917 Constitution. The Church-State conflict was mediated and ended with the aid of the [[Dwight W. Morrow|U.S. Ambassador to Mexico]] and ended with an agreement between the parties in conflict, by means of which the respective fields of action were defined. Although the constitution prohibited reelection of the president, Obregón wished to run again and the constitution was amended to allow non-consecutive re-election.  Obregón won the 1928 elections, but was assassinated by a Catholic zealot, causing a political crisis of succession. Calles could not become president again, since he has just ended his term.  He sought to set up a structure to manage presidential succession, founding the party that was to dominate Mexico until the late twentieth century. Calles declared that the Revolution had moved from ''[[caudillo|caudillismo]]'' (rule by strongmen) to the ''era institucional'' (institutional era).<ref>{{cite web|website=Instituto Nacional de Estudios Historicos de las Revoluciones de Mexico |url=https://inehrm.gob.mx/es/inehrm/Articulo_85_aniversario_de_la_Fundacion_del_Partido_Nacional_Revolucionario_PNR|title=85º ANIVERSARIO DE LA FUNDACIÓN DEL PARTIDO NACIONAL REVOLUCIONARIO (PNR)|access-date=18 July 2019|language=es|trans-title=85th anniversary of the founding of the National Revolutionary Party (PRN)|author=Rafael Hernández Ángeles}}</ref> 
[[File:Logo Petróleos Mexicanos.svg|thumb|right|Pemex, the national oil company created in 1938 for reasons of economic nationalism; it continues to provide major revenues for the government]]
Despite not holding the presidency, Calles remained the key political figure during the period known as the [[Maximato]] (1929-1934). The Maximato ended during the presidency of [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], who expelled Calles from the country and implemented many economic and social reforms. This included the [[Mexican oil expropriation]] in March 1938, which nationalized the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-[[Netherlands|Dutch]] oil company known as the [[Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company]]. This movement would result in the creation of the state-owned Mexican oil company [[Pemex]]. This sparked a diplomatic crisis with the countries whose citizens had lost businesses by Cárdenas's radical measure, but since then the company has played an important role in the economic development of Mexico. Cárdenas's successor, [[Manuel Avila Camacho|Manuel Ávila Camacho]] (1940-1946) was more moderate, and relations between the U.S. and Mexico vastly improved during [[World War II]], when Mexico was a significant ally, providing manpower and materiel to aid the war effort.

From 1946 the election of [[Miguel Alemán Valdés|Miguel Alemán]], the first civilian president in the post-revolutionary period, Mexico embarked on an aggressive program of economic development, known as the [[Mexican miracle]], which was characterized by industrialization, urbanization, and the increase of inequality in Mexico between urban and rural areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mexican Miracle: 1940–1968|work=World History from 1500|publisher=Emayzine|url=http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/mex9.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403000322/http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/mex9.html|archive-date=3 April 2007|access-date=30 September 2007}}</ref>  With robust economic growth, Mexico sought to showcase it to the world by hosting the [[1968 Summer Olympics]]. The government poured huge resources into building new facilities. At the same time, there was political unrest by university students and others with those expenditures, while their own circumstances were difficult. Demonstrations in central Mexico City went on for weeks before the planned opening of the games, with the government of [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]] cracking down. The culmination was the [[Tlatelolco Massacre]],<ref name=MMex>{{Cite book|title=Massacre in Mexico|author=Elena Poniatowska|publisher=Viking, New York|year=1975|isbn=978-0-8262-0817-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmnDdj7eP-wC|author-link=Elena Poniatowska}}</ref> which claimed the lives of around 300 protesters based on conservative estimates and perhaps as many as 800.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kennedy |first=Duncan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/7513651.stm |title=Mexico's long forgotten dirty war |work=BBC News |date=19 July 2008 |access-date=17 July 2013}}</ref>

Although the economy continued to flourish for some, [[distribution of wealth|social inequality]] remained a factor of discontent. PRI rule became increasingly authoritarian and at times oppressive in what is now referred to as the [[Mexican Dirty War]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Krauze |first=Enrique |title=Furthering Democracy in Mexico |date=January–February 2006 |publisher=Foreign Affairs |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060101faessay85106/enrique-krauze/furthering-democracy-in-mexico.html? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110074536/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060101faessay85106/enrique-krauze/furthering-democracy-in-mexico.html |archive-date=10 January 2006 |access-date=7 October 2007  }}</ref>

[[Luis Echeverría]], Minister of the Interior under Díaz Ordaz, carrying out the repression during the Olympics, was elected president in 1970. His government had to contend with mistrust of Mexicans and increasing economic problems. He instituted some with electoral reforms.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schedler|first=Andreas|title=Electoral Authoritarianism: The Dynamics of Unfree Competition|year=2006|publisher=L.

Economic problems worsened in his early term, then massive reserves of petroleum were located off Mexico's Gulf Coast. Pemex did not have the capacity to develop these reserves itself, and brought in foreign firms.  Oil prices had been high because of [[OPEC]]'s lock on oil production, and López Portilla borrowed money from foreign banks for current spending to fund social programs.  Those foreign banks were happy to lend to Mexico because the oil reserves were enormous and future revenues were collateral for loans denominated in U.S. dollars.  When the [[1980s oil glut|price of oil]] dropped, Mexico's economy collapsed in the [[Latin American debt crisis|1982 Crisis]]. Interest rates soared, the peso devalued, and unable to pay loans, the government defaulted on its [[debt]]. [[Miguel de la Madrid|President Miguel de la Madrid]] (1982–88) resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked inflation.

In the 1980s the first cracks emerged in the PRI's complete political dominance. In [[Baja California]], the [[Ernesto Ruffo Appel|PAN candidate]] was elected as governor. When De la Madrid chose [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] as the candidate for the PRI, and therefore a foregone presidential victor, [[Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas]], son of former President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], broke with the PRI and challenged Salinas in the 1988 elections. In 1988 there was massive [[electoral fraud]], with results showing that Salinas had won the election by the narrowest percentage ever. There were massive protests in Mexico City to the stolen election. Salinas took the oath of office on 1 December 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/mexico/government/mexico_government_the_1988_elections.html|title="Mexico The 1988 Elections" (Sources: The Library of the Congress Country Studies, CIA World Factbook)|publisher=Photius Coutsoukis |access-date=30 May 2010}}</ref> In 1990 the PRI was famously described by [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] as the "perfect dictatorship", but by then there had been major challenges to the PRI's hegemony.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/massacres-disappearances-and-1968-mexicans-remember-the-victims-of-a-perfect-dictatorship-104196 |last=Gomez Romero|first=Luis |title=Massacres, disappearances and 1968: Mexicans remember the victims of a 'perfect dictatorship'  |date= 5 October 2018 |website= The Conversation }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://elpais.com/diario/1990/09/01/cultura/652140001_850215.html |title=Vargas Llosa: "México es la dictadura perfecta" |date= 1 September 1990 |newspaper= El País |last1=País |first1=Ediciones El }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Reding |first=Andrew |year=1991 |title=Mexico: The Crumbling of the "Perfect Dictatorship" |jstor=40209208 |journal=World Policy Journal |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=255–284}}</ref>

Although Salinas won by fraud, he embarked on a program of [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] reforms which fixed the exchange rate of the peso, controlled inflation, opened Mexico to foreign investment, and began talks with the U.S. and Canada to join their [[free-trade agreement]]. In order to do that, the Constitution of 1917 was amended in several important ways. Article 27, which allowed the government to expropriate natural resources and distribute land, was amended to end agrarian reform and to guarantee private owners' property rights.  The anti-clerical articles that muzzled religious institutions, especially the Catholic Church, were amended and Mexico reestablished of diplomatic relations with the [[Holy See]], to which the Mexican State did not recognize as a political entity. Signing on to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) removed Mexico's autonomy over trade policy. The agreement came into effect on 1 January 1994; the same day, the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN) started a two-week-long armed rebellion against the federal government, and has continued as a non-violent opposition movement against [[neoliberalism]] and [[globalization]].

In 1994, following the assassination of the PRI's presidential candidate [[Luis Donaldo Colosio]], Salinas was succeeded by substitute PRI candidate [[Ernesto Zedillo]]. Salinas left Zedillo's government to deal with the [[Mexican peso crisis]], requiring a $50 billion [[IMF]] bailout. Major macroeconomic reforms were started by President Zedillo, and the economy rapidly recovered and growth peaked at almost 7% by the end of 1999.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cruz Vasconcelos|first=Gerardo|title=Desempeño Histórico 1914–2004|url=http://www.imef.org.mx/NR/rdonlyres/F722BEDD-A8DE-49BA-AF4F-1A00889CE618/1192/CAPITULOI1.pdf|access-date=17 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703181721/http://www.imef.org.mx/NR/rdonlyres/F722BEDD-A8DE-49BA-AF4F-1A00889CE618/1192/CAPITULOI1.pdf |archive-date=3 July 2006|language=es}}</ref>

A fourth mountain range, the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]], runs from [[Michoacán]] to [[Oaxaca]].<ref name="nationsencyclopedia1">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/Mexico-TOPOGRAPHY.html |title=Mexico Topography |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |date=16 October 2007 |access-date=30 May 2010}}</ref>

As such, the majority of the Mexican central and northern territories are located at high altitudes, and the highest elevations are found at the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt: [[Pico de Orizaba]] ({{convert|5700|m|ft|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Popocatépetl]] ({{convert|5462|m|ft|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and [[Iztaccihuatl]] ({{convert|5286|m|ft|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and the [[Nevado de Toluca]] ({{convert|4577|m|ft|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}). Three major urban agglomerations are located in the valleys between these four elevations: [[Toluca]], [[Greater Mexico City]] and [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]].<ref name="nationsencyclopedia1"/>

===Climate===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2020}}
{{Main|Climate of Mexico}}
[[File:Mexico Köppen.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Mexico map of [[Köppen climate classification]]]]
The [[Tropic of Cancer]] effectively divides the country into temperate and tropical zones. Land north of the Tropic of Cancer experiences cooler temperatures during the winter months. South of the Tropic of Cancer, temperatures are fairly constant year round and vary solely as a function of elevation. This gives Mexico one of the world's most diverse weather systems.

Areas south of the Tropic of Cancer with elevations up to {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (the southern parts of both coastal plains as well as the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]), have a yearly median temperature between {{convert|24|to|28|C|F|1}}. Temperatures here remain high throughout the year, with only a {{convert|5|C-change|0}} difference between winter and summer median temperatures. Both Mexican coasts, except for the south coast of the Bay of Campeche and northern Baja, are also vulnerable to serious [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] during the summer and fall. Although low-lying areas north of the Tropic of Cancer are hot and humid during the summer, they generally have lower yearly temperature averages (from {{convert|20|to|24|C|F|1|disp=or}}) because of more moderate conditions during the winter.

Many large cities in Mexico are located in the Valley of Mexico or in adjacent valleys with altitudes generally above {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. This gives them a year-round temperate climate with yearly temperature averages (from {{convert|16|to|18|C|F|1|disp=or}}) and cool nighttime temperatures throughout the year.

Many parts of Mexico, particularly the north, have a dry climate with sporadic rainfall while parts of the tropical lowlands in the south average more than {{convert|2000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of annual precipitation. For example, many cities in the north like [[Monterrey]], [[Hermosillo]], and [[Mexicali]] experience temperatures of {{convert|40|C|F}} or more in summer. In the [[Sonoran Desert]] temperatures reach {{convert|50|C|F}} or more.

The coastlines of Mexico harbor many stretches of beaches that are frequented by sunbathers and other visitors. [[Constitution of Mexico#Article 27|According to national law]], the entirety of the coastlines are under federal ownership, that is, all beaches in the country are [[Public property|public]]. On the Yucatán peninsula, one of the most popular beach destinations is the resort town of [[Cancún]], especially among [[university]] [[student]]s during [[spring break]]. Just offshore is the beach island of [[Isla Mujeres]], and to the east is the [[Isla Holbox]]. To the south of Cancun is the coastal strip called [[Riviera Maya]] which includes the beach town of [[Playa del Carmen]] and the ecological parks of [[Xcaret]] and Xel-Há. A day trip to the south of Cancún is the historic port of [[Tulum]]. In addition to its beaches, the town of Tulum is notable for its cliff-side [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ruins.

On the [[Pacific]] coast is the notable tourist destination of [[Acapulco]]. Once the destination for the rich and famous, the beaches have become crowded and the shores are now home to many multi-story hotels and vendors. Acapulco is home to renowned cliff divers: trained divers who leap from the side of a vertical cliff into the surf below.

At the southern tip of the [[Baja California peninsula]] is the resort town of [[Cabo San Lucas]], a town noted for its beaches and [[marlin]] [[fishing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icabo.com/what-to-do/cabo-fishing.aspx |title=Cabo Fishing Information – Sport Fishing in Los Cabos |publisher=icabo.com |access-date=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502144017/http://icabo.com/what-to-do/cabo-fishing.aspx |archive-date=2 May 2013}}</ref> Further north along the [[Sea of Cortés]] is the [[Bahía Concepción, Baja California Sur|Bahía de La Concepción]], another beach town known for its sports fishing.

Throughout the 19th century, the population of Mexico had barely doubled. This trend continued during the first two decades of the 20th century, and even in the 1921 census there was a loss of about 1 million inhabitants. The phenomenon can be explained because during the decade from 1910 to 1921 the Mexican Revolution took place. The growth rate increased dramatically between the 1930s and the 1980s, when the country registered growth rates of over 3% (1950–1980). The Mexican population doubled in twenty years, and at that rate it was expected that by the year 2000 there would be 120 million Mexicans. Life expectancy went from 36 years (in 1895) to 72 years (in the year 2000). According to estimations made by Mexico's [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía|National Geography and Statistics Institute]], as of 2017 Mexico has 123.5 million inhabitants<ref>{{cite news |title=México cuenta con 123.5 millones de habitantes |trans-title=Mexico has 123.5 million inhabitants |url=https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/politica/Mexico-cuenta-con-123.5-millones-de-habitantes-20170710-0116.html |access-date=4 June 2020 |work=El Economista |agency=Notimex |date=10 July 2017 |language=es}}</ref> making it the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world.<ref name=Spanishhistory>{{cite web|title=Spanish Language History|publisher=Today Translations|url=http://www.todaytranslations.com/index.asp-Q-Page-E-Spanish-Language-History--13053095|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050417234656/http://www.todaytranslations.com/index.asp-Q-Page-E-Spanish-Language-History--13053095|archive-date=17 April 2005|access-date=1 October 2007}}</ref> Between 2005 and 2010, the Mexican population grew at an average of 1.70% per year, up from 1.16% per year between 2000 and 2005.

Even though Mexico is a very ethnically diverse country, research about ethnicity has largely been a forgotten field, in consequence of the post-revolutionary efforts of Mexico's government to unify all non-indigenous Mexicans under a single ethnic identity (that of the "Mestizo"). As a result, since 1930 the only explicit ethnic classification that has been included in Mexican censuses has been that of "Indigenous peoples".<ref name="EL MESTIZAJE Y LAS CULTURAS REGIONALES">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015618/http://www.nacionmulticultural.unam.mx/Portal/Izquierdo/BANCO/Mxmulticultural/Elmestizajeylasculturas-elmestizaje.html|url-status=dead|title=en el censo de 1930 el gobierno mexicano dejó de clasificar a la población del país en tres categorías raciales, blanco, mestizo e indígena, y adoptó una nueva clasificación étnica que distinguía a los hablantes de lenguas indígenas del resto de la población, es decir de los hablantes de español.|archive-date=23 August 2013}}</ref> Even then, across the years the government has used different criterias to count Indigenous peoples, with each of them returning considerably different numbers ranging from 5.4% to 23% of the country's population.

Mexico had an active slave trade during the colonial period, and some 200,000 Africans were taken there, primarily in the 17th century. The creation of a national Mexican identity, especially after the Mexican Revolution, emphasized Mexico's indigenous and European past; it passively eliminated the African ancestors and contributions. Most of the African-descended population was absorbed into the surrounding Mestizo (mixed European/indigenous) and indigenous populations through unions among the groups. Evidence of this long history of intermarriage with Mestizo and indigenous Mexicans is also expressed in the fact that in the 2015 inter-census, 64.9% (896,829) of Afro-Mexicans also identified as indigenous. It was also reported that 9.3% of Afro-Mexicans speak an indigenous language.<ref>{{cite web |title=Principales resultados—Encuesta Intercensal 2015 |trans-title=Main results — Intercensal Survey 2015 |url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/proyectos/encuestas/hogares/especiales/ei2015/doc/eic_2015_presentacion.pdf |publisher=INEGI |access-date=4 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313192927/http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/proyectos/encuestas/hogares/especiales/ei2015/doc/eic_2015_presentacion.pdf |archive-date=13 March 2017 |language=es |date=2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The states with the highest self-report of Afro-Mexicans were Guerrero (6.5% of the population), Oaxaca (4.95%) and Veracruz (3.28%).<ref>{{cite web|title=Tabulados de la Encuesta Intercensal 2015|url=http://www3.inegi.org.mx/sistemas/tabuladosbasicos/LeerArchivo.aspx?ct=51553&c=33725&s=est&f=1|publisher=[[INEGI]]|access-date=24 December 2015}}</ref> Afro-Mexican culture is strongest in the communities of the [[Costa Chica of Oaxaca]] and [[Costa Chica of Guerrero]].

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Mexico}}

The letters ''b'' and ''v'' have the same pronunciation as well.{{sfn|Werner|2001|pp=443, 444, 445}} Furthermore, the usage of ''[[voseo|vos]]'', the [[grammatical person|second person]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[pronoun]], found in several Latin American varieties, is replaced by ''[[T-V distinction#Spanish|tú]]''; whereas ''[[vosotros]]'', the second person plural pronoun, fell out of use and was effectively replaced by ''ustedes''.{{sfn|Werner|2001|pp=443, 444, 445}} In written form, the [[Spanish Royal Academy]] serves as the primary guideline for spelling, except for words of Amerindian origin that retain their original phonology such as ''[[Northern mockingbird|cenzontle]]'' instead of ''sinzontle'' and [[Name of Mexico|''México'' not ''Méjico'']]. Words of foreign origin also maintain their original spelling such as whisky and film, as opposed to ''güisqui'' and ''filme'' as the Royal Academy suggests.{{sfn|Werner|2001|pp=443, 444, 445}} The letter ''x'' is distinctly used in Mexican Spanish, which may be pronounced as {{IPA|[ks]}} (as in ''oxígeno'' or ''taxi''), as {{IPA|[ʃ]}} particularly in Amerindian words (e.g. ''mixiote'', ''Xola'' and ''uxmal'') and as the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPAblink|x}} (such as ''Texas'' and ''Oaxaca'').{{sfn|Werner|2001|pp=443, 444, 445}}

The denominations [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] also have an important presence, especially in the cities of the border and in the indigenous communities.

According to [[Jacobo Grinberg]] (in texts edited by the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]), it is remarkable the survival of magic-religious rituals of the old [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] groups, not only in the current indigenous people but in the [[mestizo]]s and [[white people|whites]] that make up the Mexican rural and urban society. There is often a [[syncretism]] between [[shamanism]] and the Catholic tradition. Another religion of popular syncretism in Mexico (especially in recent years) is the [[Santería]]. This is mainly due to the large number of Cubans who settled in the territory after the [[Cuban Revolution]] (mainly in states such as [[Veracruz]] and [[Yucatán]]). Although Mexico was also a recipient of black slaves from [[Africa]] in the 16th century, the apogee of these cults is relatively new.<ref>{{Cite book| author = Jacobo Grinberg Zylberbaum | title = Los chamanes de México | date = 1989 | publisher = UNAM School of Psychology | location = Mexico City | isbn = 9686022015 | edition = University of Texas | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1QVZAAAAMAAJ&q=chamanes+en+M%C3%A9xico}}</ref> In general, popular religiosity is viewed with bad eyes by institutionally structured religions. One of the most exemplary cases of popular religiosity is the cult of [[Santa Muerte|Holy Dead]] (Santa Muerte).{{fact|date=November 2020}} The Catholic hierarchy insists on describing it as a satanic cult. However, most of the people who profess this cult declare themselves to be Catholic believers, and consider that there is no contradiction between the tributes they offer to the [[Christ Child]] and the adoration of God. Other examples are the representations of the [[Stations of the Cross|Passion of Christ]] and the celebration of [[Day of the Dead]], which take place within the framework of the Catholic Christian imaginary, but under a very particular reinterpretation of its protagonists.{{fact|date=November 2020}}	

In certain regions, the profession of a creed other than the Catholic is seen as a threat to community unity. It is argued that the Catholic religion is part of the ethnic identity, and that the Protestants are not willing to participate in the traditional customs and practices (the [[tequio]] or community work, participation in the festivities and similar issues). The refusal of the Protestants is because their religious beliefs do not allow them to participate in the cult of images. In extreme cases, tension between Catholics and Protestants has led to the expulsion or even murder of Protestants in several villages. The best known cases are those of [[San Juan Chamula]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/11/11/042n3est.php|title=En Chamula, cambiar religión se considera delito|date=16 June 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616041417/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/11/11/042n3est.php|archive-date=16 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2000/06/03/pol4.html|title=pol4|website=www.jornada.unam.mx}}</ref> in Chiapas, and San Nicolás, in [[Ixmiquilpan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/07/22/mas-hilo.html|title=mas-hilo|website=www.jornada.unam.mx}}</ref> [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]].

A similar argument was presented by a committee of anthropologists to request the government of the Republic to expel the [[SIL International|Summer Linguistic Institute]] (SIL), in the year 1979, which was accused of promoting the division of indigenous peoples by translating the [[Bible]] into vernacular languages and evangelizing in a Protestant creed that threatened the integrity of popular cultures. The Mexican government paid attention to the call of the anthropologists and canceled the agreement that had held with the SIL.<ref name="WP">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1979/09/29/mexico-to-end-work-of-us-translators-with-indians/ "Mexico to End Works of U.S. Translators With Indians"], "The Washington Post", 29 September 1979. Retrieved on 3 December 2020.</ref> Conflicts have also occurred in other areas of social life. For example, given that Jehovah's Witnesses are prohibited from surrendering honors to national symbols (something that is done every Monday in Mexican public schools), children who have been educated in that religion were expelled from public schools. This type of problem can only be solved with the intervention of the National Commission of [[Human Rights]], and not always with favorable results for children.

State-funded institutions such as [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS) and the [[Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers]] (ISSSTE) play a major role in health and social security.

Medical training is done mostly at public universities with much specializations done in vocational or internship settings. Some public universities in Mexico, such as the [[University of Guadalajara]], have signed agreements with the U.S. to receive and train American students in Medicine.

Until the twentieth century, Mexico was an overwhelmingly rural country, with rural women's status defined within the context of the family and local community.  With urbanization beginning in the sixteenth century, following the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire]], cities have provided economic and social opportunities not possible within rural villages.  Beginning in the late nineteenth century, women including middle-class women began working outside the home in offices and factories, and the gained access to education.<ref>Porter, Susie S.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Mexico}}
[[File:Talaveraarmando.jpg|thumb|[[Talavera pottery]]]]
Mexican culture reflects the complexity of the [[History of Mexico|country's history]] through the blending of indigenous cultures and the [[culture of Spain]], imparted during Spain's 300-year colonial rule of Mexico. Exogenous cultural elements have been incorporated into Mexican culture as time has passed.

The Porfirian era (''el [[Porfirio Díaz|Porfiriato]]''), in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, was marked by economic progress and peace. After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President Díaz himself. Since that time, as accentuated during the [[Mexican Revolution]], cultural identity has had its foundation in the ''mestizaje'', of which the indigenous (i.e. Amerindian) element is the core. In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, [[José Vasconcelos]] in ''La Raza Cósmica'' (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races (thus extending the definition of the ''mestizo'') not only biologically but culturally as well.<ref name="vasconcelos160">{{Cite book|last=Vasconcelos|first=José|others=Didier T.

=== Painting ===
{{Main|Mexican art}}
[[File:Murales Rivera - Ausbeutung durch die Spanier 1 perspective.jpg|thumb|[[Mexican Muralism]]. A cultural expression starting in the 1920s created by a group of Mexican painters after the [[Mexican Revolution]].]]
[[Painting]] is one of the oldest arts in Mexico. Cave painting in Mexican territory is about 7500 years old and has been found in the caves of the [[Baja California Peninsula]]. Pre-Hispanic Mexico is present in buildings and caves, in [[Aztec codices]], in [[ceramics]], in garments, etc. .; examples of this are the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] mural paintings of [[Bonampak]], or those of [[Teotihuacán]], those of [[Cacaxtla]] and those of [[Monte Albán]].

Mural painting with religious themes had an important flowering during the 16th century; the same in religious constructions as in houses of lineage; such is the case of the convents of [[Acolman]], [[Actopan, Hidalgo|Actopan]], [[Huejotzingo]], [[Tecamachalco, Puebla|Tecamachalco]] and [[Zinacantepec]]. These were also manifested in illustrated manuscripts such as the 1576 [[Florentine codex]] overseen by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]].  Most art in the colonial era was religious, but starting in the late seventeenth century and most prominently in the eighteenth century, secular portraits and [[casta|casta painting]] appeared. Important painters of the late colonial period were [[Juan Correa]], [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]] and [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]].

Nineteenth-century painting had a marked romantic influence; landscapes and portraits were the greatest expressions of this era. [[Hermenegildo Bustos]] is one of the most appreciated painters of the [[historiography]] of Mexican art. Other painters include [[:es:Santiago Rebull|Santiago Rebull]], [[Félix Parra]], [[Eugenio Landesio]], and his noted pupil, the landscape artist [[José María Velasco Gómez|José María Velasco]].<ref>Widdiefield, Stacie G.  ''The Embodiment of the National in Late Nineteenth-Century Mexican Painting''. Tucson: University of Arizona Press 1996</ref>

[[Mexican art|Mexican painting]] of the 20th century has achieved world renown with figures such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], [[Joaquín Clausell]], [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[Diego Rivera]], a generation of idealists who marked the image of modern Mexico in the face of strong social and economic criticism. The Oaxacan School quickly gained fame and prestige, diffusion of ancestral and modern culture. Freedom of design is observed in relation to the color and texture of the canvases and murals as a period of transition between the 20th century and the 21st century. [[Federico Cantú Garza]], [[Juan O'Gorman]], and [[Rufino Tamayo]] are also important artists. Diego Rivera, the most well-known figure of [[Mexican muralism]], painted the [[Man at the Crossroads]] at the [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City, a huge mural that was destroyed by the Rockefellers the next year because of the inclusion of a portrait of Russian communist leader [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rockefeller Controversy|publisher=Diego Rivera Prints|url=http://www.diego-rivera.org/rockefellercontroversy.html|access-date=2 October 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011103154/http://www.diego-rivera.org/rockefellercontroversy.html|archive-date=11 October 2007}}</ref> Some of Rivera's murals are displayed at the Mexican [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] and the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes|Palace of Fine Arts]].
 
Some of the most outstanding painters in the late 20th century and early 21st century: [[Francisco Toledo]] was a Mexican Zapotec painter, sculptor, and graphic artist. In a career that spanned seven decades, Toledo produced thousands of works of art and became widely regarded as one of Mexico's most important contemporary artists. [[Verónica Ruiz de Velasco]] is a [[neofigurative]] painter and muralist.  Both [[Verónica Ruiz de Velasco]] and [[Francisco Toledo]] were students of [[Rufino Tamayo]]. [[Gilberto Aceves Navarro]] is also considered an important contemporary artist.

Throughout history several prominent painters of different nationalities have expressed in their works the face of Mexico. Among the most outstanding we can mention are [[Claudio Linati]], [[Daniel Thomas Egerton]], [[Carl Nebel]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[Leonora Carrington]].

=== Sculpture ===
{{Main|Sculpture in Mexico}}
Sculpture was an integral part of pre-Hispanic [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations, ([[Maya civilization|Mayans]], [[Olmec]]s, [[Toltec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, [[Aztec]]s), and others, usually religious in nature. From the Spanish conquest in 1521, civil and religious sculpture was created by indigenous artists, with guidance from Spaniards, so some pre-Hispanic features are evident. Since the 17th century, white and [[mestizo]] sculptors have created works with a marked influence of European classicism. After independence in 1821, sculpture was influenced by Romanticism, which tended to break the strict norms and models of classicism, while it pursued ideas influenced by realism and nationalism. Religious sculpture was reduced to a sporadic imagery, while the secular sculpture continued in portraits and monumental art of a civic nature. Between 1820 and 1880 the predominant themes were, successively: religious images, biblical scenes, allegories to the symbols of the independence insurgency, scenes and personages of pre-Hispanic history, and busts of the old aristocracy, of the nascent bourgeoisie and commanders of the pre-revolution. During the 20th century, some important exponents of Mexican sculpture are [[Juan Soriano (artist)|Juan Soriano]], [[José Luis Cuevas]], and [[Sebastián (sculptor)|Enrique Carbajal]] (also known as Sebastián).{{fact|date=November 2020}}

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Architecture of Mexico}}
[[Image:SSA41434.JPG|thumb|[[Teotihuacán]], [[State of Mexico]]]] 
The presence of the humans in the Mexican territory has left important archaeological findings of great importance for the explanation of the habitat of primitive man and contemporary man. The Mesoamerican civilizations managed to have great stylistic development and proportion on the human and urban scale, the form was evolving from simplicity to aesthetic complexity; in the north of the country the adobe and stone architecture is manifested, the multifamily housing as we can see in [[Casas Grandes]]; and the troglodyte dwelling in caves of the Sierra Madre Occidental.  Urbanism had a great development in pre-Hispanic cultures, where we can see the magnitude of the cities of [[Teotihuacán]], [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tollan-Xicocotitlan]] and [[Tenochtitlan|México-Tenochtitlan]], within the environmentalist urbanism highlight the Mayan cities to be incorporated into the monumentality of its buildings with the thickness of the jungle and complex networks of roads called ''sakbés''. [[Mesoamerican architecture]] is noted for its pyramids which are the largest such structures outside of Ancient Egypt.{{fcat}}

[[Spanish Colonial architecture]] is marked by the contrast between the simple, solid construction demanded by the new environment and the Baroque ornamentation exported from Spain. Mexico, as the center of New Spain has some of the most renowned buildings built in this style.
With the arrival of the Spaniards, architectural theories of the Greco-Roman order with Arab influences were introduced. Due to the process of [[Evangelization in New Spain|evangelization]], when the first monastic temples and monasteries were built, their own models were projected, such as the [[mendicant monasteries in Mexico|mendicant monasteries]], unique in their type in architecture. The interaction between Spaniards and natives gave rise to artistic styles such as the so-called ''[[tequitqui]]'' (from [[Nahuatl]]: worker). Years later the baroque and mannerism were imposed in large cathedrals and civil buildings, while rural areas are built [[hacienda]]s or stately farms with Mozarabic tendencies.{{fact|date=November 2020}}
[[Image:Ext 06Museo Soumaya FREE Fernando Romero EnterprisE photo by Adam Wiseman.jpg|180px|thumb|left|[[Museo Soumaya]] in Mexico City building]] 
In the 19th century the neoclassical movement arose as a response to the objectives of the republican nation, one of its examples are the [[Hospicio Cabañas]] where the strict plastic of the classical orders are represented in their architectural elements, new religious buildings also arise, civilian and military that demonstrate the presence of neoclassicism. Romanticists from a past seen through archeology show images of medieval Europe, Islamic and pre-Hispanic Mexico in the form of architectural elements in the construction of international exhibition pavilions looking for an identity typical of the national culture. The ''art nouveau'', and the ''art deco'' were styles introduced into the design of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] to mark the identity of the Mexican nation with Greek-Roman and pre-Hispanic symbols.{{fact|date=November 2020}}

Modern architecture in Mexico has an important development in the plasticity of form and space, [[José Villagrán García]] develops a theory of form that sets the pattern of teaching in many schools of architecture in the country within functionalism. The emergence of the new [[Mexican architecture]] was born as a formal order of the policies of a nationalist state that sought modernity and the differentiation of other nations. The development of a Mexican modernist architecture was perhaps mostly fully manifested in the mid-1950s construction of the [[Ciudad Universitaria, Mexico City]], the main campus of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]. Designed by the most prestigious architects of the era, including [[Mario Pani]], [[Eugenio Peschard]], and [[Enrique del Moral]], the buildings feature murals by artists [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[José Chávez Morado]]. It has since been recognized as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/364 |title=UNESCO |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=2007-06-29 |access-date=2013-08-17}}</ref>

[[Juan O'Gorman]] was one of the first environmental architects in Mexico, developing the "organic" theory, trying to integrate the building with the landscape within the same approaches of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arqhys.com/arquitectura-mexicana.html|title=Arquitectura mexicana|website=www.arqhys.com}}</ref> In the search for a new architecture that does not resemble the styles of the past, it achieves a joint manifestation with the mural painting and the [[landscaping]].

The Jalisco School was a proposal of those socio-political movements that the country demanded. [[Luis Barragán]] combined the shape of the space with forms of rural vernacular architecture of Mexico and Mediterranean countries (Spain-Morocco), integrating an impressive color that handles light and shade in different tones and opens a look at the international [[minimalism]]. He won the 1980 [[Pritzker Prize]], the highest award in architecture.{{fact|date=November 2020}}

Mexican architecture is a cultural phenomenon born of the ideology of nationalist governments of the 20th century, which was shaping the identity image by its colorful and variegated ornamental elements inherited from ancestral cultures, classical and monumental forms and, subsequently, the incorporation of modernism and cutting-edge international trends.{{fact|date=November 2020}}

Mexico has been photographed since the nineteenth century, when the technology was first developed. During the Porfiriato, Díaz realized the importance of photography in shaping the understanding of his regime and its accomplishments.  The government hired [[Guillermo Kahlo]] (father of painter [[Frida Kahlo]]) to create photographic images of Mexico's new industrial structures as well as its pre-Hispanic and colonial past.  Photographer [[Hugo Brehme]] specialized in images of "picturesque" Mexico, with images of Mexican places and often rural people.  During the Mexican Revolution, photographers chronicled the conflict, usually in the aftermath of a battle, since large and heavy equipment did not permit action shots. [[Agustín Casasola|Agustín Victor Casasola]] is the most famous of photographer of the revolutionary era, and he collected other photographers' images in the [[Casasola Archive]]; his vast collection was purchased by the Mexican government and is now part of the government photographic repository, the Fototeca.<ref>Casanova, Rosa and Adriana Konzevik.

Mexican literature has its antecedents in the literature of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica. Poetry had a rich cultural tradition in prehispanic Mexico, being divided into two broad categories—secular and religious. Aztec poetry was sung, chanted, or spoken, often to the accompanyment of a drum or a harp. While Tenochtitlan was the political capital, [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] was the cultural center; the Texcocan language was considered the most melodious and refined. The best well-known prehispanic poet is [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Aztecs at Mexicolore|first=John|last=Curl|access-date=14 July 2019|date=20 August 2009 |title=Aztec Poetry (1): Introduction |url=https://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/home/aztec-poetry-1-intro}}</ref>

Literature during the 16th century consisted largely of histories of Spanish conquests, and most of the writers at this time were from Spain. [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo|Bernal Díaz del Castillo's]] [[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España|True History of the Conquest of Mexico]] is still widely read today.

The origin of the current Mexican cuisine is established during the Spanish colonial era, a mixture of the foods of [[Spain]] with native indigenous ingredients.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://projects.ups.edu/jlago/spring2003/250a/jlkeller/ | title = History and influences of Mexican food. | author = University of Puget Sound | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111208232651/http://projects.ups.edu/jlago/spring2003/250a/jlkeller/ | archive-date = 8 December 2011}}</ref> Of foods originated in Mexico is the [[corn]], the [[capsicum|pepper vegetables]] (together with Central and South America), [[calabaza]]s (together with the Americas), [[avocado]]s, [[sweet potato]] (together with Central and South America), the [[Turkey as food|turkey]] (together with the Americas) and other fruits and spices. Other Indigenous products are many [[beans]]. Similarly, some cooking techniques used today are inherited from pre-Hispanic peoples, such as the [[nixtamalization]] of corn, the cooking of food in ovens at ground level, grinding in [[molcajete]] and [[metate]]. With the Spaniards came the pork, beef and chicken meats; [[Piper (plant)|peppercorn]], sugar, milk and all its derivatives, wheat and rice, citrus fruits and another constellation of ingredients that are part of the daily diet of Mexicans.

From this meeting of millennia old two culinary traditions, were born [[pozole]], [[mole sauce]], [[barbacoa]] and [[tamale]] is in its current forms, the [[chocolate]], a large range of [[Mexican breads|bread]]s, [[taco]]s, and the broad repertoire of [[Mexican street food]]s. Beverages such as [[atole]], [[champurrado]], milk chocolate and [[aguas frescas]] were born; desserts such as [[acitrón]] and the full range of crystallized sweets, [[rompope]], [[cajeta]], [[jericaya]] and the wide repertoire of delights created in the convents of nuns in all parts of the country.
