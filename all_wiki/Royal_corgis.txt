'''Royal corgis''' were the [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]] dogs owned by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and her parents, [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].

In 2007, Elizabeth II had five corgis: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow, and Holly; five [[cocker spaniel]]s: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick, and Span; and four dorgis ([[dachshund]]-corgi [[Crossbred dog|crossbreeds]]): Cider, Berry, Vulcan, and Candy.

The royal corgis were globally publicised (such as in the cover photo and feature article of ''Vanity Fair'''s Summer 2016 edition<ref name="vanityFair">{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4352389/queen-elizabeth-vanity-fair-cover-corgis/|title=Meet the Real Stars of Queen Elizabeth II's Vanity Fair Cover — Her Four Corgis|last=Lang|first=Cady|date=2016-05-31}}</ref>). Leaving a lasting legacy after death, they have been depicted and immortalised in various artwork, such as statues, professional photographs, and paintings.

Elizabeth II's mother, at that time [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], introduced a disciplined regimen for the dogs; each was to have its own [[wicker]] basket, raised above the floor to avoid drafts.
