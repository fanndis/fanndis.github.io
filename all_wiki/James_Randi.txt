'''James Randi''' (born '''Randall James Hamilton Zwinge'''; August 7, 1928&nbsp;– October 20, 2020) was a Canadian-American [[stage magician]]<ref name="stage magician1"/><ref name="stage magician2"/><ref name="stage magician3"/> and [[scientific skepticism|scientific skeptic]]<ref name="scientific skeptic1"/><ref name="scientific skeptic2"/><ref name="scientific skeptic3"/> who extensively challenged [[paranormal]] and [[pseudoscientific]] claims.<ref name="Rodrigues">[[#Rodrigues|Rodrigues 2010]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=OsGuZjYzXdAC&pg=PA271 p. 271]</ref> He was the co-founder of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] (CSI), and founder of the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] (JREF). Randi began his career as a magician under the stage name '''The Amazing Randi''' and later chose to devote most of his time to investigating paranormal, [[occult]], and [[supernatural]] claims, which he collectively called "woo-woo".<ref name="Randiwoo">{{cite journal|last=Randi|first=James|date=February 9, 2007|title=More Geller Woo-Woo|journal=Swift|type=Newsletter|access-date=December 26, 2016|url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/020209morebrowne.html#i7|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710012001/http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/020209morebrowne.html#i7|archive-date=July 10, 2009}}</ref> Randi retired from practicing magic at age 60, and from his foundation at 87.

He initially presented himself under his real name, Randall Zwinge, which he later dropped in favor of "The Amazing Randi". Early in his career, he performed numerous escape acts from jail cells and safes around the world. On February 7, 1956, he appeared live on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' show, where he remained for 104 minutes in a sealed metal coffin that had been submerged in a hotel swimming pool, breaking what was said to be [[Harry Houdini]]'s record of 93 minutes, though Randi called attention to the fact that he was much younger than Houdini had been when he established the original record in 1926.<ref name="Sinclair">{{cite news |title=Television & radio column |first=Gordon |last=Sinclair |author-link=Gordon Sinclair |newspaper=[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]] |date=February 7, 1956}}</ref><ref name="Bryant">{{cite news |title=Handcuffs no problem Toronto-born magician laughs at locksmiths |first=George |last=Bryant |newspaper=Toronto Daily Star |date=June 21, 1956}}</ref>

Randi also hosted numerous television specials and went on several world tours.

Randi has been accused of actually using "psychic powers" to perform acts such as [[spoon bending]]. According to [[James Alcock]], at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of [[Uri Geller]], a professor from the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] shouted out that Randi was a fraud. Randi said: "Yes, indeed, I'm a trickster, I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's what I do for a living. Everything I've done here was by trickery." The professor shouted back: "That's not what I mean. You're a fraud because you're pretending to do these things through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it."<ref name="RpPRF">[[#Alcock|Alcock 2001]], p. 42</ref> A similar event involved Senator [[Claiborne Pell]], a confirmed believer in psychic phenomena. When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal—by simple trickery—a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying: "I think Randi may be a psychic and doesn't realize it." Randi consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.<ref name="BprO1">[[#Gardner|Gardner 2000]], p. 178</ref>

Randi was a member of the [[Society of American Magicians]] (SAM), the International Brotherhood of Magicians (IBM), and [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]] in the UK, holding the rank of "Member of the Inner Magic Circle with Gold Star."<ref name="34MHb">{{cite web|url=http://themagiccircle.co.uk/news/711-the-magic-circle-president-promotes-a-knight-a-dragon-and-student-doctor-of-magic?highlight=WyJyYW5kaSJd|title=TMC Promotions|date=January 11, 2013|access-date=July 22, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723074917/http://themagiccircle.co.uk/news/711-the-magic-circle-president-promotes-a-knight-a-dragon-and-student-doctor-of-magic?highlight=WyJyYW5kaSJd|archive-date=July 23, 2015}}</ref>

===Author===
Randi wrote 10 books, among them ''[[Conjuring (book)|Conjuring]]'' (1992), a biographical history of prominent magicians. The book is subtitled ''Being a Definitive History of the Venerable Arts of Sorcery, Prestidigitation, Wizardry, Deception, & Chicanery and of the Mountebanks & Scoundrels Who have Perpetrated these Subterfuges on a Bewildered Public, in short, MAGIC!'' The book's cover indicates it is by "James Randi, Esq., A Contrite Rascal Once Dedicated to these Wicked Practices but Now Almost Totally Reformed". The book features the most influential magicians and tells some of their history, often in the context of strange deaths and careers on the road. This work expanded on Randi's second book, ''Houdini, His Life and Art''.<ref name="Milkwaukee">{{cite news |last=Bartlett |first=Kay |title=Truthful trickster |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RU4aAAAAIBAJ&pg=3862,1502395 |access-date=July 13, 2012 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Journal]] |date=July 13, 1981}}</ref> This illustrated work was published in 1976 and was co-authored with [[Bert Sugar]].

Randi's book, ''The Magic World of the Amazing Randi'' (1989), was intended as a children's introduction to magic tricks. In addition to his magic books, he wrote several educational works about paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. These include biographies of Uri Geller and [[Nostradamus]], as well as reference material on other major paranormal figures. In 2011, he was working on ''A Magician in the Laboratory'', which recounted his application of skepticism to science.<ref name="BxJDd">{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/1194-teleportation-magic-established-by-science-at-last.html |title=Teleportation Magic Established By Science, At Last! |last=Randi |first=James |work=Swift |publisher=JREF |type=Blog |access-date=January 19, 2011}}</ref> He was a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the [[Trap Door Spiders]], which served as the basis of his friend [[Isaac Asimov]]'s fictional group of mystery solvers, the [[Black Widowers]].<ref name="Asimov1994-120">[[#Asimov|Asimov 1994]]</ref>

Other books by Randi include ''[[Flim-Flam!

Randi was a regular contributor to ''[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]]'' magazine, penning the "'Twas Brillig ..." column, and also served on its editorial board. He was a frequent contributor to ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine, published by [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]], of which he was also a Fellow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://skepticalinquirer.org/2017/03/still-amazing-a-conversation-with-james-randi/ |title=Still 'Amazing': A Conversation with James Randi|last=Frazier|first=Kendrick|date=March-April 2017|website=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=41|issue=2|access-date=July 15, 2020}}</ref>

Randi gained the international spotlight in 1972 when he publicly challenged the claims of [[Uri Geller]]. He accused Geller of being nothing more than a [[charlatan]] and a [[fraud]] who used standard magic tricks to accomplish his allegedly paranormal feats, and he presented his claims in the book ''[[The Truth About Uri Geller]]'' (1982).<ref name="Taft" /><ref name="Rensberger">{{cite news|first=Boyce|last=Rensberger|title=Magicians Term Israeli 'Psychic' a Fraud|work=The New York Times|page=29|date=December 13, 1975 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/12/13/archives/magicians-term-israeli-psychic-a-fraud.html |access-date=July 19, 2020}}</ref><ref name="iYmd2">{{cite news |title=God's Chariot!

Believing that it was important to get columnists and TV personalities to challenge Geller and others like him, Randi and [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSICOP]] reached out in an attempt to educate them. Randi said that CSICOP had a "very substantial influence on the printed media ... in those days."<ref name="CSICon" />{{rp|20:05}} During this effort, Randi made contact with [[Johnny Carson]] and discovered that he was "very much on our side.

In 1973, Geller appeared on ''The Tonight Show'', and this appearance is recounted in the ''[[Nova (American TV program)|Nova]]'' documentary "[[Secrets of the Psychics]]".<ref name="Secrets" />{{efn|A two-minute clip of this documentary with the Geller segment has been widely circulated on the Internet since Randi acquired permission to use it from NBC, and Carson paid for the expensive and complex transfer from the original, physically degraded, two-inch videotape recording.<ref name="QGmHu">{{cite web|url = http://www.randi.org/jr/2007-03/032307hope.html#i9| archive-url = http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090711011032/http%3A//www%2Erandi%2Eorg/jr/2007%2D03/032307hope%2Ehtml#i9| archive-date = July 11, 2009| title = Geller on the Ropes| date=March 30, 2007| access-date = December 22, 2007}}</ref>}}{{efn|James Randi discussed obtaining the clip of Uri Geller on ''The Tonight Show''.}}

In the documentary, Randi says that Carson "had been a magician himself and was skeptical" of Geller's claimed [[paranormal]] powers, so before the date of taping, Randi was asked "to help prevent any trickery". Per Randi's advice, the show prepared its own props without informing Geller, and did not let Geller or his staff "anywhere near them". When Geller joined Carson on stage, he appeared surprised that he was not going to be interviewed, but instead was expected to display his abilities using the provided articles. Geller said "This scares me" and "I'm surprised because before this program your producer came and he read me at least 40 questions you were going to ask me." Geller was unable to display any paranormal abilities, saying "I don't feel strong" and expressing his displeasure at feeling like he was being "pressed" to perform by Carson.<ref name="Secrets">{{cite episode |last=Charlson |first=Carl |title=[[Secrets of the Psychics]] |date=1993 |series=NOVA |network=PBS |time=8'25" |ref={{harvid|"Secrets of the Psychics"}}}}</ref><ref name="6ZPaj">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|author-link= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/132 132]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/132}}</ref> According to Adam Higginbotham's November 7, 2014 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'':<ref name="Higginbotham">{{cite news|last=Higginbotham|first=Adam|title=The Unbelievable Skepticism of the Amazing Randi|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/magazine/the-unbelievable-skepticism-of-the-amazing-randi.html?action=click&contentCollection=Magazine&region=Footer&module=MoreInSection&pgtype=article|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=November 7, 2014|access-date=November 8, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108162548/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/magazine/the-unbelievable-skepticism-of-the-amazing-randi.html?action=click&contentCollection=Magazine&region=Footer&module=MoreInSection&pgtype=article|archive-date=November 8, 2014}}</ref>

However, this appearance on ''The Tonight Show'', which Carson and Randi had orchestrated to debunk Geller's claimed abilities, backfired. According to Higginbotham:<ref name="Higginbotham" />
{{quote|text=To Geller's astonishment, he was immediately booked on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]''. He was on his way to becoming a paranormal superstar. "That Johnny Carson show made Uri Geller," Geller said.

According to Higginbotham, this result caused Randi to realize that much more must be done to stop Geller and those like him. So in 1976, Randi approached [[Ray Hyman]], a psychologist who had observed the tests of Geller's ability at Stanford and thought them slipshod, and suggested they create an organization dedicated to combating pseudoscience. Later that same year, together with [[Martin Gardner]], a ''Scientific American'' columnist whose writing had helped hone Hyman's and Randi's skepticism, they formed the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] (CSICOP).<ref name="Higginbotham" />

Using donations and sales of their magazine, ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', they and secular humanist philosopher [[Paul Kurtz]] took seats on the executive board, with [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Carl Sagan]] joining as founding members. Randi travelled the world on behalf of CSICOP, becoming its public face, and according to Hyman, the face of the skeptical movement.<ref name="Higginbotham" />

András G.

Randi appeared on numerous TV shows, sometimes to directly debunk the claimed abilities of fellow guests. In a 1981 appearance on ''[[That's My Line]]'', Randi appeared opposite claimed psychic [[James Hydrick]], who said that he could move objects with his mind and appeared to demonstrate this claim on live television by turning a page in a telephone book without touching it.<ref name="lookatpast">{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-09/092206bad.html#i11 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090709213130/http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-09/092206bad.html#i11 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 9, 2009 |title=A Look at the Past |last=Randi |first=James |date=September 22, 2006 |work=Swift |publisher=JREF |type=Newsletter |access-date=September 20, 2013}}</ref> Randi, having determined that Hydrick was surreptitiously blowing on the book, arranged [[Foam peanut|foam packaging peanuts]] on the table in front of the telephone book for the demonstration.

[[File:Randi 1983.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Randi speaking at the first [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSICOP]] Conference, in Buffalo, New York, 1983]]

Randi was awarded a [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Foundation]] [[MacArthur Fellows Program|Fellowship]] in 1986. The fellowship's five-year $272,000 grant helped support Randi's investigations of faith healers, including [[W. V. Grant]], [[Ernest Angley]], and [[Peter Popoff]], whom Randi first exposed on ''The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'' in February 1986. Hearing about his investigation of Popoff, Carson invited Randi onto his show without seeing the evidence he was going to reveal. Carson appeared stunned after Randi showed a brief video segment from one of Popoff's broadcasts showing him calling out a woman in the audience, revealed personal information about her that he claimed came from God, and then performed a laying-on-of-hands healing to drive the devil from her body. Randi then replayed the video, but with some of the sound dubbed in that he and his investigating team captured during the event using a radio scanner and recorder. Their scanner had detected the radio frequency Popoff's wife Elizabeth was using backstage to broadcast directions and information to a miniature radio receiver hidden in Popoff's left ear. That information had been gathered by Popoff's assistants, who had handed out "prayer cards" to the audience before the show, instructing them to write down all the information Popoff would need to pray for them.<ref name="Faith Healers">[[#Randi 1987|Randi 1987]], pp. 139–181</ref><ref name="Heavenly Messages">{{cite news |title=Skeptics' Revelations: Faith Healer Receives 'Heavenly' Messages Via Electronic Receiver, Debunkers Charge |first=John |last=Dart |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-11/local/me-5518_1_faith-healer |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 11, 1986 |access-date=August 18, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015155733/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-11/local/me-5518_1_faith-healer |archive-date=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Randi Debunks Popoff">{{citation |title=James Randi Debunks Peter Popoff Faith Healer |via=YouTube}}</ref>

In February 1988, Randi tested the gullibility of the media by perpetrating a hoax of his own. By teaming up with Australia's ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' program and by releasing a fake press package, he built up publicity for a "[[Mediumship|spirit channeler]]" named Carlos,<ref name="Higginbotham" /> who was actually artist José Alvarez, Randi's partner. While performing as Carlos, Alvarez was prompted by Randi using sophisticated radio equipment. According to the ''60 Minutes'' program on the Carlos hoax, "it was claimed that Alvarez would not have had the audience he did at the Opera House (and the resulting potential sales therefrom) had the media coverage been more aggressive (and factual)", though an analysis by ''[[Australian Skeptics|The Skeptic]]''{{'}}s Tim Mendham concluded that, while the media coverage of Alvarez's appearances was not credulous, the hoax "at least showed that they could benefit by being a touch more sceptical".<ref name="rkmyl">{{cite journal |last=Mendham |first=Tim |year=1988 |title=The Carlos Hoax |journal=The Skeptic |volume=8 |issue=1 |access-date=April 19, 2013 |issn=0726-9897 |oclc=53994493 |url=http://www.skeptics.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/theskeptic/2ndcoming/skepticism.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419063417/http://www.skeptics.com.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/theskeptic/2ndcoming/skepticism.pdf |archive-date=April 19, 2013}}</ref> The hoax was exposed on ''60 Minutes Australia''; "Carlos" and Randi explained how they had pulled it off.<ref name="xsxlM">{{cite web |url=http://www.skepdic.com/carlos.html |title='Carlos' hoax |work=The Skeptic's Dictionary |publisher=[[Robert Todd Carroll]] |access-date=June 15, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605100136/http://skepdic.com/carlos.html |archive-date=June 5, 2009}}</ref><ref name="NEQPg">{{cite interview |last=Randi |first=James |interviewer=Paul Willis |title=James Randi and the Great Carlos |work=The Correx Archives |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=May 7, 1998 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/randi4.htm |access-date=June 15, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715171756/http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/randi4.htm |archive-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref>

In 1982, Randi verified the abilities of [[Arthur Lintgen]], a Philadelphia doctor, who was able to identify the classical music recorded on a [[Gramophone record|vinyl LP]] solely by examining the grooves on the record.

Randi stated that [[Daniel Dunglas Home]], who could allegedly play an accordion that was locked in a cage without touching it, was caught cheating on a few occasions, but the incidents were never made public.

"Dr. Henry Slade was, of course, identified and recognized as the principal slate-writing medium, but at various times he presented other phenomena, one of which was the playing of an accordion while held in one hand under the table. The accordion was taken by him from the table with his right hand, at the end containing the strap, the keys or notes at the other end being away from him. He thus held the accordion beneath the table, and his left hand was laid on top of the table, where it was always in plain view. Nevertheless, the accordion was heard to give forth melodious tunes, and at the conclusion was brought up on top of the table as held originally; the whole dodge consisting in turning the accordion end for end as it went under the table. The strap end being now downward, and held between the legs, the medium's hand grasped the keyboard end, and worked the bellows and keys, holding the accordion firmly with the legs and working the hand, not with an arm movement, but mostly by a simple wrist movement. Of course, at the conclusion, the hand grasped the accordion at the strap end, and brought it up in this condition. Sometimes an accordion is tied with strings and sealed so the bellows cannot be worked. This is for the dark séance. Even in this condition the accordion is played by inserting a tube in the air-hole or valve and by the medium's using his lungs as bellows."</ref>

Randi distinguished between [[pseudoscience]] and "crackpot science".

''Exploring Psychic Powers ... Live'' was a two-hour television special aired live on June 7, 1989, wherein Randi examined several people claiming psychic powers. Hosted by actor [[Bill Bixby]], the program offered $100,000 (Randi's $10,000 prize plus $90,000 put up by the show's [[Broadcast syndication|syndicator]], [[Lexington Broadcast Services Company|LBS Communications, Inc.]]<ref name="6jiX6">{{cite podcast |url=http://clear-light.msspro.com/files/Randi_2003-Jul-31.wav |title=Randi_2003-Jul-31.wav |website=JREF Internet Broadcast Archive|host=Randi, James |format=[[WAV]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907063148/http://clear-light.msspro.com/files/Randi_2003-Jul-31.wav |archive-date=September 7, 2003 |date=July 31, 2003 |time=0:33:19 |access-date=November 28, 2006}}</ref>) to anyone who could demonstrate genuine psychic powers.
* An [[astrologer]], Joseph Meriwether, claimed that he was able to ascertain a person's [[astrological sign]] after talking with them for a few minutes. He was presented with twelve people, one at a time, each with a different astrological sign. They could not tell Meriwether their astrological sign or birth date, nor could they wear anything that would indicate it. After Meriwether talked to them, he had them go and sit in front of the astrological sign that he thought was theirs. By agreement, Meriwether needed to get ten of the 12 correct, to win. He got none correct.<ref name="Bauer">{{Cite book |last=Bauer |first=Craig P. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1156319304 |title=Discrete encounters |isbn=978-0-429-40050-6 |location=[Place of publication not identified] |pages=322 |oclc=1156319304}}</ref>
* The next psychic, Barbara Martin, claimed to be able to read [[aura (paranormal)|auras]] around people, claiming that auras were visible at least five inches above each person. She selected ten people from a group of volunteers who she said had clearly visible auras. On stage were erected ten screens, numbered ''1'' through ''10'', just tall enough to hide the volunteer while not hiding their aura. Unseen by Martin, some of the volunteers positioned themselves behind different screens, then she was invited to predict which screens hid volunteers by seeing their aura above. She stated that she saw an aura over all ten screens, but people were behind only four of the screens.<ref name="Bau2020">{{cite book |last1=Bauer |first1=Craig |title=Discrete Encounters |date=2020 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-429-68289-6 |page=332 |url=https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Discrete_Encounters/WUjpDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Barbara+Martin+aura+James+Randi&pg=PA322 |language=en}}</ref>
* A [[Dowsing|dowser]], Forrest Bayes, claimed that he could detect water in a bottle inside a sealed cardboard box. He was shown twenty boxes and asked to indicate which boxes contained a water bottle. He selected eight of the boxes, which he said contained water, but it turned out that only five of the twenty contained water. Of the eight selected boxes, only one was revealed to contain water and one contained sand. It was not revealed whether any of the remaining six boxes contained water.<ref name="Bauer" />
* A [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometric psychic]], Sharon McLaren-Straz, claimed to be able to receive personal information about the owner of an object by handling the object itself. In order to avoid ambiguous statements, the psychic agreed to be presented with both a watch and a key from each of twelve different people. She was to match keys and watches to their owners. According to the prior agreement, she had to match at least nine out of the twelve sets, but she succeeded in only two.<ref name="Bau2020" />
* Professional crystal healer Valerie Swan attempted to use [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]] to identify 250 [[Zener cards]], guessing which of the five symbols was on each one. Random guessing should have resulted in about fifty correct guesses, so it was agreed in advance that Swan had to be right on at least eighty-two cards in order to demonstrate an ability greater than chance. However, she was able to get only fifty predictions correct, which is no better than random guessing.<ref name="eQBdU">[[#Polidoro|Polidoro 2003]], pp. 19–24</ref>

===James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF)===
{{main|James Randi Educational Foundation}}
In 1996, Randi established the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]]. Randi and his colleagues publish in JREF's blog, ''Swift''. Topics have included the interesting mathematics of the [[one-seventh area triangle]], a classic geometric puzzle.

==One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge==
{{Main|One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge}}
The James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) offered a prize of US$1,000,000 to anyone able to demonstrate a supernatural ability under [[Science|scientific]] testing criteria agreed to by both sides. Based on the paranormal challenges of [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] and [[Houdini]], the foundation began in 1996, when Randi put up $1,000 of his own money payable to anyone who could provide objective proof of the paranormal.<ref name="Poulsen">{{cite news |title=Skeptic Revamps $1M Psychic Prize |first=Kevin |last=Poulsen |author-link=Kevin Poulsen |url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/01/72482 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |location=San Francisco |date=January 12, 2007 |access-date=April 11, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831010919/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/01/72482 |archive-date=August 31, 2008}}</ref> The prize money grew to $1,000,000, and had formal published rules.

On April 1, 2007, it was ruled that only persons with an established, nationally recognized media profile and the backing of a reputable academic were allowed to apply for the challenge, in order to avoid wasting JREF resources on frivolous claimants.<ref name="Poulsen" />

==Legal disputes==
Randi was involved in a variety of legal disputes, but said that he had "never paid even one dollar or even one cent to anyone who ever sued me."<ref name="Randiwoo" /> However, he said, he had paid out large sums to defend himself in these suits.

===Uri Geller===
Randi met magician [[Uri Geller]] in the early 1970s, and found Geller to be "Very charming. Likable, beautiful, affectionate, genuine, forward-going, handsome—everything!"<ref name="Higginbotham" /> But Randi viewed Geller as a con-man, and began a long effort to expose him as a fraud.<ref name="Higginbotham" /> According to Randi, Geller tried to sue him several times, accusing him of libel. Geller never won, save for a ruling in a Japanese court that ordered Randi to pay Geller one-third of one per cent of what Geller had requested. This ruling was cancelled, and the matter dropped, when Geller decided to concentrate on another legal matter.<ref name="Randiwoo" /><ref name="r8P1f">{{cite web |url=http://www.uri-geller.com/psir.htm |title=An End to the ''Uri Geller vs. Randi & CSICOP'' Litigations? |last=Truzzi |first=Marcello |author-link=Marcello Truzzi |publisher=UriGeller.com |access-date=October 9, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208201045/http://www.uri-geller.com/psir.htm |archive-date=December 8, 2012}}</ref>

{{wikisource|Geller v. Randi}}
In May 1991, Geller sued Randi and CSICOP for $15&nbsp;million on a charge of slander, after Randi told the ''[[The New York Times International Edition|International Herald Tribune]]'' that Geller had "tricked even reputable scientists" with stunts that "are the kind that used to be on the back of cereal boxes", referring to the old spoon-bending trick. The court dismissed the case and Geller had to settle at a cost to him of $120,000, after Randi produced a cereal box which bore instructions on how to do the spoon-bending trick. Geller's lawyer Don Katz was disbarred mid-way into this action and Geller ended up suing him. After failing to pay by the deadline imposed by the court, Geller was sanctioned an additional $20,000.<ref name="lgKNL">{{Cite book|title=Uri Geller: Magician or Mystic?|last=Margolis|first=Jonathan|publisher=Orion Books|year=1999|isbn=978-1566490252|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/urigellermagicia0000marg}}</ref><ref name="xAZLD">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/08/29/a-case-of-mind-over-matter/a9dd790d-6e7c-4cff-b232-19f17b7df272/|title=A Case of Mind Over Matter|last=Thompson|first=Tracy|date=August 29, 1991|work=The Washington Post|access-date=September 29, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005051241/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/08/29/a-case-of-mind-over-matter/a9dd790d-6e7c-4cff-b232-19f17b7df272/|archive-date=October 5, 2017}}</ref><ref name="MrUUs">{{Cite web|url=http://urigellerdoit.blogspot.ca/|title=How does Uri Geller do it?|last=Cacho|first=Flavio|date=August 1, 2008|website=Blogger|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929232152/http://urigellerdoit.blogspot.ca/|archive-date=September 29, 2017}}</ref><ref name="csicop-suitdismissed">{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/articles/uri_dis.html |title=Uri Geller Libel Suit Dismissed |date=August 1994 |website=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry |publisher=Center for Inquiry |location=Amherst, NY |archive-url=https://archive.today/20061205032721/http://www.csicop.org/articles/uri_dis.html |archive-date=December 5, 2006 |access-date=June 3, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="skepfiles-suitdismssed">{{cite web |url=http://www.skepticfiles.org/skeptic/randi032.htm |title=Lawsuit Against CSICOP Dismissed |website=The Skeptic Tank |publisher=Fredric L.

In 1993, a jury in the U.S. District Court in Baltimore found Randi liable for defaming Eldon Byrd for calling him a child molester in a magazine story and a "shopping market molester" in a 1988 speech.

Clarifying his view of atheism, Randi wrote "I've said it before: there are two sorts of atheists. One sort claims that there is no deity, the other claims that there is no evidence that proves the existence of a deity; I belong to the latter group, because if I were to claim that no god exists, I would have to produce evidence to establish that claim, and I cannot.

Randi married [[Venezuelans|Venezuelan]] artist José Alvarez (born Deyvi Orangel Peña Arteaga) on July 2, 2013 in Washington. Randi, who had recently moved to Florida, met Alvarez in 1986, in a Fort Lauderdale public library. Arteaga had left his native country for fear of his life, as he was a homosexual. The pseudonym Arteaga had taken, Jose Alvarez, was an actual person in the United States. The identity confusion caused the real Alvarez some legal and financial difficulties. Arteaga was arrested for identity theft and faced deportation.

In the 1993 documentary ''[[Secrets of the Psychics]]'', Randi stated, "I've never involved myself in narcotics of any kind; I don't smoke; I don't drink, because that can easily just fuzz the edges of my rationality, fuzz the edges of my reasoning powers, and I want to be as aware as I possibly can. That means giving up a lot of fantasies that might be comforting in some ways, but I'm willing to give that up in order to live in an actually real world, as close as I can get to it".{{sfn|"Secrets of the Psychics"|loc=10′45″}}
