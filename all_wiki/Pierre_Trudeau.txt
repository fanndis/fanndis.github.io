His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada's [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada by time in office|third longest-serving]] Prime Minister, behind [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and [[John A. Macdonald]].

Trudeau rose to prominence as a lawyer, intellectual, and activist in [[Québec]] politics. He joined the Liberal Party and was elected to the [[Canadian Parliament]] in 1965, quickly being appointed as Prime Minister [[Lester&nbsp;B. Pearson|Lester&nbsp;B. Pearson's]] [[Parliamentary Secretary]]. In 1967, he was appointed [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]]. Trudeau's outgoing personality caused a media sensation, inspiring "[[Trudeaumania]]", and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968, when he was appointed Prime Minister of Canada.

From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, Trudeau's personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life. After his appointment as Prime Minister, he won the [[1968 Canadian federal election|1968]], [[1972 Canadian federal election|1972]] and [[1974 Canadian federal election|1974]] elections, before narrowly losing in [[1979 Canadian federal election|1979]]. He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards, in [[1980 Canadian federal election|1980]], and eventually retired from politics shortly before the [[1984 Canadian federal election|1984 election]].

Despite his personal motto, "Reason before passion",<ref name="NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy"/> his personality and political career aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office. Admirers praised what they consider to be the force of Trudeau's intellect{{sfn| Mallick (2000-09-30)|p=P04}} and his political acumen, maintaining national unity over the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]], suppressing a Québec [[October Crisis|terrorist crisis]], fostering a pan-Canadian identity, and in achieving sweeping institutional reform, including the implementation of [[Official bilingualism in Canada|official bilingualism]], [[patriation]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Constitution]], and the establishment of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''.{{sfn|The Globe and Mail (2000-09-29)|p=A20}} Critics accused him of arrogance, of economic mismanagement, and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Québec and the economy of the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]].{{sfn|Fortin (2000-10-09)|p=A17}}

His eldest son, [[Justin Trudeau]], became the 23rd and current Prime Minister, following the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 election]] and [[2019 Canadian federal election|2019 election]], and is the first prime minister of Canada to be a descendant of a former prime minister.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/election/trudeau-s-win-ushers-in-canada-s-first-political-dynasty-1.2618093|title=Trudeau's win ushers in Canada's first political dynasty|last=Coorsh|first=Karolyn|date=October 20, 2015|website=[[CTVNews]]|language=en|access-date=January 17, 2020}}</ref>

He had an older sister named Suzette and a younger brother named Charles Jr. Trudeau remained close to both siblings for his entire life. Trudeau attended the prestigious [[Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf]] (a private French [[Jesuit]] school), where he supported [[Québec nationalism]]. Trudeau's paternal grandparents were French-speaking Quebec farmers.<ref name="NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy"/> His father, Charles-Émile Trudeau, had acquired a chain of gas stations, some "profitable mines, the Belmont amusement park in Montreal and the [[Montreal Royals]], the city's minor-league baseball team" by the time Trudeau was fifteen.<ref name="NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy"/> When his father died in Orlando, Florida, on April 10, 1935, Trudeau and each of his siblings inherited $5,000, a considerable sum at that time, which meant that he was financially secure and independent.<ref name="Vintage_English_2007">{{cite book |pages=624 |publisher=Vintage Canada |date=August 28, 2007 |orig-year=2006|isbn=9780676975222 |oclc=1044330987 |last= English |first= John|title=Citizen of the World: The life of Pierre Elliot Trudeau|volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n1M-pbdhsIMC&q=father |access-date=February 21, 2020}}</ref>{{rp|24}} His mother, Grace, "doted on Pierre"<ref name="Vintage_English_2007"/>{{rp|25}} and he remained close to her throughout her long life.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)}} After her husband died, she left the management of her inheritance to others and spent a lot of her time with work for the Roman Catholic Church and other charities, travelling frequently to New York, Florida, Europe, and Maine, sometimes with her children.<ref name="Vintage_English_2007"/>{{rp|25}} Already in his late teens, Trudeau was "directly involved in managing a large inheritance."<ref name="Vintage_English_2007"/>{{rp|25}}

==Early education==

From the age of six until twelve, Trudeau attended the primary school, Académie Querbes, in [[Outremont]], where he became immersed in the Catholic religion. The school which was for both English and French Catholics, was an exclusive school with very small classes and he excelled in mathematics and religion.<ref name="Vintage_English_2007"/>{{rp|25–27}} From his earliest years, Trudeau was fluently bilingual which would later prove to be a "big asset for a politician in bilingual Canada."<ref name="economist_obituary_20001005"/> As a teenager, he attended the Jesuit [[French language|French-language]] Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, a prestigious secondary school known for educating elite francophone families in Québec.<ref name="Vintage_English_2007"/>{{rp|27}}<ref>[http://www.canoe.com/archives/infos/general/2008/09/20080917-165426.html Rank] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129190141/http://www.canoe.com/archives/infos/general/2008/09/20080917-165426.html |date=January 29, 2009 }}</ref>

In his seventh and final academic year, 1939–1940, Trudeau focused on winning a [[Rhodes Scholarship]]. In his application he wrote that he had prepared for public office by studying public speaking and publishing many articles in ''Brébeuf''. His letters of recommendations praised him highly. Father Boulin, who was the head of the college, said that during his seven years at the college (1933–1940), Trudeau had won a "hundred prizes and honourable mentions" and "performed with distinction in all fields".{{rp|65}} Trudeau graduated from Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf in 1940 at the age of twenty-one.<ref name="Vintage_English_2007"/>{{rp|47}}

Trudeau did not win the Rhodes Scholarship. He consulted a number of people on his options including [[Henri Bourassa]], the economist Edmond Montpetit, and Father Robert Bernier, a Franco-Manitoban. Following their advice, he chose a career in politics, and a degree in law at the [[Université de Montréal]].{{rp|73}}

==The Second World War==
In his obituary, ''[[The Economist]]'' described Trudeau as "parochial as a young man", who "dismissed the second world war as a squabble between the big powers, although he later regretted "missing one of the major events of the century".<ref name="economist_obituary_20001005">{{Cite news| issn = 0013-0613| title = Pierre Trudeau| work = [[The Economist]] |date=October 5, 2000|access-date=February 22, 2020| url = https://www.economist.com/obituary/2000/10/05/pierre-trudeau |series=Obituary}}</ref> In his 1993 ''Memoir,'' Trudeau wrote that the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 and his father's death were the two "great bombshells" that marked his teenage years.<ref name="Trudeau_Memoirs_1993"/>{{rp|37}} In his first year at university, the prime topics of conversation were the [[Battle of France]], the [[Battle of Britain]], and the [[The Blitz|London blitz]].<ref name="Trudeau_Memoirs_1993"/>{{rp|32}} He wrote that in the early 1940s, when he was in his early twenties, he thought, "So there was a war? Tough. It wouldn't stop me from concentrating on my studies so long as that was possible..[I]f you were a French Canadian in Montreal [at that time], you did not automatically believe that this was a just war. In Montreal in the early 1940s, we still knew nothing about the Holocaust and we tended to think of this war as a settling of scores among the superpowers."<ref name="Trudeau_Memoirs_1993"/>{{rp|32}}

Young Trudeau was opposed to overseas [[conscription]]<ref name="Trudeau_Memoirs_1993"/>{{rp|32}} and in 1942, he campaigned for the anti-conscription candidate [[Jean Drapeau]] (later the [[Mayor of Montreal]]) in [[Outremont (electoral district)|Outremont]].<ref name="Trudeau_Memoirs_1993"/>{{rp|34}} Trudeau described a speech he heard in Montreal by [[Ernest Lapointe]],<ref name="Trudeau_Memoirs_1993"/>{{rp|32–35}} who was then Prime Minister [[William Mackenzie King]]'s top adviser on issues relating to Quebec and French-speaking Canada. Lapointe had been a Liberal MP during the 1917 [[Conscription Crisis of 1917|conscription crisis]], in which the Canadian government had deployed up to 1,200 soldiers to suppress the Quebec City anti-conscription Easter Riots in March and April 1918. In a final and bloody conflict, soldiers fired on the crowds. At least five men were killed by gunfire and there were over 150 casualties and $300,000 in damage.<ref name="CHR_Auger_2008">{{cite journal |first=Martin F. |last=Auger |title=On the Brink of Civil War: The Canadian Government and the Suppression of the 1918 Quebec Easter Riots |journal=[[Canadian Historical Review]] |volume= 89 |number=4|date=December 2008 |pages=503–540 |doi=10.3138/chr.89.4.503}}</ref>{{rp|504}}<ref name="Granastein_1977">{{cite book |title=Broken Promises: A History of Conscription in Canada |first1=Jack Lawrence |last1=Granatstein |first2=J. |last2=MacKay Hitsman |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1977 |isbn=0195402588 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/brokenpromiseshi0000gran/page/281 281] |location=Toronto |url=https://archive.org/details/brokenpromiseshi0000gran/page/281 }}</ref>{{rp|60}} In 1939, it was Lapointe who helped draft the Liberal's policy against conscription for service overseas.

His criticisms of King's war time policies, such as "suspension of habeas corpus", the "farce of bilingualism and French-Canadian advancement in the army. The forced "voluntary enrolment", was scathing.<ref name="Vintage_English_Citizen_2007"/>{{rp|191}}

As a university student Trudeau joined the [[Canadian Officers' Training Corps]] (COTC). They trained at the local armoury in Montreal during the school term and undertook further training at Camp Farnham each summer.<ref name="Trudeau_Memoirs_1993"/>{{rp|34}} Although the ''[[National Resources Mobilization Act]]'' was enacted in 1940, preparing the way for conscription to serve overseas, there was no conscription until the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]] in response to the [[Invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944.

==Education==
Trudeau continued his full-time studies in law at the Université de Montréal while in the COTC, during the war, from 1940 until his graduation in 1943.

Following his graduation in 1943, Trudeau articled for a year, and in the fall of 1944, began his master's in [[political economy]] at what is now called [[Harvard University]]'s [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] and was then known as the Graduate School of Public Administration. In his ''Memoir'', he admitted that it was at Harvard's "super-informed environment", that he realized the "historic importance" of the war and that he had "missed one of the major events of the century in which [he] was living.<ref name="Trudeau_Memoirs_1993"/>{{rp|37}} Harvard had become a major intellectual centre as fascism in Europe led to the great intellectual migration to the United States.{{sfn|English (2006)|p=124}}

Trudeau's Harvard dissertation was on the topic of Marxism, communism and Christianity.{{sfn|English (2006)|pp=145–146}} At Harvard, a predominantly Protestant American university, Trudeau who was French Catholic, and who for the first time was living outside the province of Quebec, felt like an outsider. {{sfn|English (2006)|p=134}} As his sense of isolation deepened,<ref name="Vintage_English_Citizen_2007">{{cite book  | last= English

In the summer of 1948, Trudeau embarked on world travels to find a sense of purpose.<ref name="Vintage_English_Citizen_2007"/>{{rp|176}} At the age of twenty-eight, he travelled to Poland where he visited Auschwitz, then Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Turkey, the Middle East, including Jordan and southern Iraq.<ref name="Vintage_English_Citizen_2007"/>{{rp|176–179}} Although he was very wealthy, Trudeau traveled with a back pack in "self-imposed hardship".<ref name="economist_obituary_20001005"/> He used his British passport instead of his Canadian passport in his travels through Pakistan, India, China, and Japan, often wearing local clothing to blend in.<ref name="Vintage_English_Citizen_2007"/>{{rp|180–190}} According to ''The Economist'', when Trudeau returned to Canada in 1949 after an absence of five years, his mind was "seemingly broadened" from his studying at Harvard, the Institut d'Études Politiques, and the LSE and his travels. He was "appalled at the narrow nationalism in his native French-speaking Quebec, and the authoritarianism of the province's government.<ref name="economist_obituary_20001005"/>

==Quiet Revolution==
{{main|Quiet Revolution}}
Beginning while Trudeau was travelling overseas, a number of events took place in Quebec that were precursors to the [[Quiet Revolution]] in Quebec. These include the 1948 [[Refus global]], the publication of [[Les insolences du Frère Untel]], the 1949 [[Asbestos Strike]], and the 1955 [[Richard Riot]]. Artists and intellectuals in Quebec signed the <em>Refus global</em> on August 9, 1948 in opposition to the repressive rule of [[Premier of Quebec]] [[Maurice Duplessis]] and the decadent "social establishment" in Quebec, including the Catholic Church.<ref name="Borduas_19480809">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Borduas |first=Paul-Émile |title=Refus Global Manifesto |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |date=24 July 2015 |publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |edition=online |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/refus-global-manifesto}}</ref><ref name="Ellenwood_200910">{{Cite book| title = The Automatiste Revolution |publisher=Douglas & McIntyre|access-date=February 22, 2020| url = http://www.douglas-mcintyre.com/book/the-automatiste-revolution |first1=Ray |last1=Ellenwood |first2=Roald |last2=Nasgaard |date=October 2009 |isbn=978-1-55365-356-1 |pages=160}}</ref> When he returned to Montreal in 1949, Trudeau quickly became a leading figure opposing Duplessis' rule. Trudeau actively supported the workers in the Asbestos Strike who opposed Duplessis in 1949. Trudeau was the co-founder and editor of ''[[Cité Libre]]'', a dissident journal that helped provide the intellectual basis for the Quiet Revolution. In 1956 he edited an important book on the subject, ''La grève de l'amiante'', which argued that the asbestos miners' strike of 1949 was a seminal event in Québec's history, marking the beginning of resistance to the conservative, [[Francophone]] clerical establishment and [[English language|Anglophone]] business class that had long ruled the province.<ref name="Vintage_English_Citizen_2007"/>{{rp|289,292}}

==Career==
Because of his labour union activities in Asbestos, Trudeau was blacklisted by Premier Duplessis and he was unable to teach law at the Université de Montréal.<ref name="economist_obituary_20001005"/> He surprised his closest friends in Quebec when he became a civil servant in Ottawa in 1949. He worked for the federal government until 1951 in the [[Privy Council Office (Canada)|Privy Council Office]] of the Liberal Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]] as an economic policy advisor. He wrote in his memoirs that he found this period very useful later on, when he entered politics, and that senior civil servant [[Norman Robertson]] tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to stay on.

His progressive values and his close ties with [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF) intellectuals (including [[F. R. Scott]], [[Eugene Forsey]], [[Michael Kelway Oliver]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]) led to his support of and membership in that federal [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party throughout the 1950s.{{sfn|English (2006)|p=364}}

An associate professor of law at the Université de Montréal from 1961 to 1965, Trudeau's views evolved towards a liberal position in favour of individual rights counter to the state and made him an opponent of Québec nationalism. He admired the labour unions, which were tied to the [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF), and tried to infuse his Liberal party with some of their reformist zeal. By the late 1950s Trudeau began to reject social democratic and labour parties, arguing that they should put their narrow goals aside and join forces with Liberals to fight for democracy first.<ref>Christo Aivalis, "In the Name of Liberalism: Pierre Trudeau, Organized Labour, and the Canadian Social Democratic Left, 1949–1959," ''Canadian Historical Review'' (June 2013) 94#7 pp 263–288 {{DOI|10.3138/chr.1498}}</ref> In economic theory he was influenced by professors [[Joseph Schumpeter]] and [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] while he was at Harvard. Trudeau criticized the Liberal Party of [[Lester Pearson]] when it supported arming [[Boeing CIM-10 Bomarc|Bomarc missiles]] in Canada with [[nuclear weapon|nuclear warhead]]s.{{sfn|English (2006)|pp=183–185}}

He was offered a position at [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] teaching political science by [[James Corry (academic)|James Corry]], who later became principal of Queen's, but turned it down because he preferred to teach in Québec.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=63–64}} During the 1950s he was [[blacklisted]] by the United States and prevented from entering that country because of a visit to a conference in Moscow, and because he subscribed to a number of [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] publications. Trudeau later appealed the ban and it was rescinded.

==Political career==
[[File:Trudeau Nomination.jpg|thumb|Trudeau after being nominated to represent the riding of Mount Royal, June 6, 1965]]
{{See also|Electoral history of Pierre Trudeau}}

In 1965, Trudeau joined the Liberal party, along with his friends [[Gérard Pelletier]] and [[Jean Marchand]]. These "three wise men" ran successfully for the Liberals in the [[1965 Canadian federal election|1965 election]]. Trudeau himself was elected in the safe Liberal riding of [[Mount Royal (electoral district)|Mount Royal]], in western Montreal. He would hold this seat until his retirement from politics in 1984, winning each election with large majorities. His decision to join the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] rather than the CCF's successor, the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) was partly based on his belief that the federal NDP could not achieve power. He also doubted the feasibility of the centralizing policies of the party. He felt that the party leadership tended toward a "''deux nations''" approach he could not support.{{sfn|English (2006)|pp=364–365}}

Upon arrival in Ottawa, Trudeau was appointed as Prime Minister Lester Pearson's parliamentary secretary, and spent much of the next year travelling abroad, representing Canada at international meetings and bodies, including the [[United Nations]]. In 1967 he was appointed to Pearson's [[Canadian cabinet|cabinet]] as [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]].{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|p=?}}

As Minister of Justice, Trudeau was responsible for introducing the landmark ''[[Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69|Criminal Law Amendment Act]]'', an [[omnibus bill]] whose provisions included, among other things, the decriminalization of homosexual acts between consenting adults, the legalization of contraception, abortion and lotteries, new gun ownership restrictions as well as the authorization of breathalyzer tests on suspected drunk drivers. Trudeau famously defended the segment of the bill decriminalizing homosexual acts by telling reporters that "there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation", adding that "what's done in private between adults doesn't concern the Criminal Code".{{sfn|CBC News (1967-12-21)}} Trudeau paraphrased the term from Martin O'Malley's  editorial piece in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' on December 12, 1967.{{sfn|CBC News (1967-12-21)}}{{sfn|O'Malley (1967-12-12)|p=6}} Trudeau also liberalized divorce laws, and clashed with Québec Premier [[Daniel Johnson, Sr.]] during constitutional negotiations.

[[File:Trudeau podium2.JPG|thumb|Trudeau at the Liberal convention after winning the leadership]]
At the end of Canada's centennial year in 1967, Prime Minister Pearson announced his intention to step down, and Trudeau entered the race for the Liberal leadership. His energetic campaign attracted massive media attention and mobilized many young people, who saw Trudeau as a symbol of generational change. Going into the leadership convention, Trudeau was the front-runner and a clear favourite with the Canadian public. However, many Liberals still had reservations given that he joined the Liberal Party in 1965 and that his views, particularly those on divorce, abortion, and homosexuality, were seen as radical and opposed by a substantial segment of the party. During the convention, prominent Cabinet Minister [[Judy LaMarsh]] was caught on television profanely stating that Trudeau wasn't a Liberal.<ref name="Don't let the bastard win">

</ref>

Nevertheless, at the April [[1968 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election|1968 Liberal leadership convention]], Trudeau was elected as the leader on the fourth ballot, with the support of 51% of the delegates. He defeated several prominent and long-serving Liberals including [[Paul Martin Sr.]], [[Robert Winters]] and [[Paul Hellyer]]. As the new leader of the governing Liberals, Trudeau was sworn in as Prime Minister two weeks later on April 20.

==Prime Minister, 1968–79==
===First and second governments, 1968–74===
Trudeau soon called an election, for June 25. His election campaign benefited from an unprecedented wave of personal popularity called "[[Trudeaumania]]",<ref name="Collison"/>{{sfn|Zink (1972)|p=Backcover}}{{sfn|Canada.com}} which saw Trudeau mobbed by throngs of youths. Trudeau's main national opponents were [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|PC]] leader [[Robert Stanfield]] and [[New Democratic Party of Canada|NDP]] leader [[Tommy Douglas]], both popular figures who had been Premiers, respectively, of Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan (albeit in Trudeau's native Québec, the main competition to the Liberals was from the [[Ralliement créditiste]], led by [[Réal Caouette]]). As a candidate Trudeau espoused [[participatory democracy]] as a means of making Canada a "[[Just Society]]". He defended vigorously the newly implemented [[universal health care]] and [[regional development]] programmes, as well as the recent reforms found in the Omnibus bill.

On the eve of the election, during the annual [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day]] parade in Montreal, rioting [[Quebec separatism|Québec sovereignists]] threw rocks and bottles at the grandstand where Trudeau was seated, chanting "Trudeau au poteau!" (Trudeau – to the stake!). Rejecting the pleas of his aides that he take cover, Trudeau stayed in his seat, facing the rioters, without any sign of fear. The image of the defiant Prime Minister impressed the public, and he handily won the [[1968 Canadian federal election|1968 election]] the next day.{{sfn|CBC News (1968-06-24)}}{{sfn|Maclean's Magazine (1998-04-06)}}

====Domestic affairs====
Trudeau's first government implemented many procedural reforms to make Parliament and the Liberal caucus meetings run more efficiently, significantly expanded the size and role of the Prime Minister's office,{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=22–24}} and substantially expanded social-welfare programs.{{sfn|Lyon & Van Die|pp=137–144 }}{{sfn|Laxer (1977)|pp=22–24}}{{sfn|Moscovitch (2012)}}<ref>Towards A Just Society: The Trudeau Years edited by Thomas S. Axworthy and Pierre Elliott Trudeau</ref>

=====Bilingualism and multiculturalism=====
Trudeau's first major legislative push was implementing the majority of recommendations of Pearson's [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] via the ''[[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]]'', which made French and English the co-equal official languages of the federal government.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/O-3.01/page-1.html |title = Official Languages Act – 1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.) |work = Act current to July 11th, 2010 |publisher = Department of Justice |accessdate = August 15, 2010 }}</ref> More controversial than the declaration (which was backed by the NDP and, with some opposition in caucus, the PCs) was the implementation of the Act's principles: between 1966 and 1976, the francophone proportion of the civil service and military doubled, causing alarm in some sections of anglophone Canada that they were being disadvantaged.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=141}}<ref name="Knopf_English_2009">{{cite book |last= English |first = John |title = Just Watch Me: The Life of Pierre Elliott Trudeau Volume Two: 1968–2000 |location= Toronto |publisher  = Knopf Canada |isbn= 978-0-676-97523-9 |oclc=759510344|date= October 15, 2009 |pages=624}}</ref>

Trudeau's Cabinet fulfilled Part IV of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism's report by announcing a "[[Multiculturalism]] Policy" on October 8, 1971. This statement recognized that while Canada was a country of two official languages, it recognized a plurality of cultures – "a multicultural policy within a bilingual framework".{{sfn|English (2009)|p=145}} This annoyed public opinion in Québec, which believed that it challenged Québec's claim of Canada as a country of two nations.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=146}}

The 1999 [[National Film Board]] (NFB) documentary featuring young Canadians including the writer [[John Duffy (writer)|John Duffy]], focused on how Trudeau's efforts to create a bilingual Canada affected them in the 1970s.<ref name="NFB_JustWatchMe_1999">{{Cite AV media| publisher = [[National Film Board of Canada]]| people = Director [[Catherine Annau]], Producers [[Gerry Flahive]] and [[Yves Bisallon]], Featuring [[Evan Adams]], [[John Duffy (writer)|John Duffy]], Doug Garson, André Gobeil, Susanne Hilton, Sylvain Marois, Meg McDonald, Jocelyne Perrier | title = Just watch me: Trudeau and the 70's generation| location = Brooklyn, N.Y.|date=September 1999 |oclc=748578882}} [[Icarus Films]] (2011), 76 minutes.</ref>

====October Crisis====
Trudeau's first serious test came during the October Crisis of 1970, when a Marxist group, the ''[[Front de libération du Québec]]'' (FLQ) kidnapped British Trade Consul [[James Cross]] at his residence on October 5. Five days later Québec Labour Minister [[Pierre Laporte]] was also kidnapped. Trudeau, with the acquiescence of Premier of Quebec Robert Bourassa, responded by invoking the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' which gave the government sweeping powers of arrest and detention without trial. Trudeau presented a determined public stance during the crisis, answering the question of how far he would go to stop the violence by saying "[[Just watch me]]". Laporte was found dead on October 17 in the trunk of a car. The cause of his death is still debated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independance-quebec.com/flq/octobre/laporte_mort.html|title=La mort de Pierre Laporte|last=grovin@caramail.com|website=Site historique du Front de libération du Québec|accessdate=January 25, 2018|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114114229/http://www.independance-quebec.com/flq/octobre/laporte_mort.html|archive-date=November 14, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Five of the FLQ members were flown to Cuba in 1970 as part of a deal in exchange for James Cross' life, although they eventually returned to Canada years later, where they served time in prison.{{sfn|Munroe (2012)}}

Although this response is still controversial and was opposed at the time as excessive by parliamentarians like Tommy Douglas and [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]], it was met with only limited objections from the public.{{sfn|Janigan (1975-11-01)|p=3}}

====Constitutional affairs====
After consultations with the provincial premiers, Trudeau agreed to attend a conference called by [[Premier of British Columbia|British Columbia Premier]] [[W. A. C. Bennett]] to attempt to finally [[patriation|patriate]] the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]].{{sfn|English (2009)|p=135}} Negotiations with the provinces by Minister of Justice John Turner created a draft agreement, known as the [[Victoria Charter]], that entrenched a charter of rights, bilingualism, and a guarantee of a veto of constitutional amendments for Ontario and Québec, as well as regional vetoes for [[Western Canada]] and [[Atlantic Canada]], within the new constitution.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=135}} The agreement was acceptable to the nine predominantly-English speaking provinces, while Québec's Premier Robert Bourassa requested two weeks to consult with his cabinet.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=135}} After a strong backlash of popular opinion against the agreement in Québec, Bourassa stated Québec would not accept it.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=136}}

====World affairs====
In foreign affairs, Trudeau kept Canada firmly in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]), but often pursued an independent path in international relations. He established Canadian diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, before the United States did, and went on an official visit to Beijing. He was known as a friend of [[Fidel Castro]], the leader of [[Cuba]].

Trudeau was the first world leader to meet [[John Lennon]] and his wife [[Yoko Ono]] on their "tour for [[world peace]]". Lennon said, after talking with Trudeau for 50 minutes, that Trudeau was "a beautiful person" and that "if all politicians were like Pierre Trudeau, there would be world peace".{{sfn|Canadian Press (1969-12-24)}}

====1972 election====
In the [[1972 Canadian federal election|federal election of 1972]], the Liberals won a minority government, with the New Democratic Party led by David Lewis holding the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]].

Requiring NDP support to continue, the government would move to the political left, including the creation of [[Petro-Canada]].

====1974 election====
In May 1974 the House of Commons passed a [[motion of no confidence]] in the Trudeau government, defeating its budget bill after Trudeau intentionally antagonized Stanfield and Lewis.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=233}} The [[1974 Canadian federal election|election of 1974]] focused mainly on the [[1973–75 recession|current economic recession]]. Stanfield proposed the immediate introduction of [[wage and price controls]] to help end the increasing [[inflation]] Canada was currently facing.  Trudeau mocked the proposal, saying to a newspaper reporter that it was the equivalent of a magician saying "Zap! You're frozen", and instead promoted a variety of small tax cuts to curb inflation.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=237}} A campaign tour featuring Trudeau's wife and infant sons was popular, and NDP supporters scared of wage controls moved toward the Liberals.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=238}}

The Liberals were re-elected with a majority government with 141 of the 264 seats, prompting Stanfield's retirement. The Liberals won no seats in Alberta, though, where [[Peter Lougheed]] was a vociferous opponent of Trudeau's 1974 budget.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=240}}

===Third government, 1974–79===
While popular with the electorate, Trudeau's promised minor reforms had little effect on the growing rate of inflation, and he struggled with conflicting advice on the crisis.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=246}} In September 1975 the popular Finance Minister John Turner resigned over a perceived lack of support in [[Countervailing duties|countervailing measures]].{{sfn|English (2009)|p=282}} In October 1975, in an embarrassing about-face, Trudeau and new Finance Minister [[Donald Stovel Macdonald|Donald Macdonald]] introduced wage and price controls by passing the ''[[Anti-Inflation Act]]''. The breadth of the legislation, which touched on many powers traditionally considered the purview of the provinces, prompted [[Reference re Anti-Inflation Act|a Supreme Court reference]] that only upheld the legislation as an [[Peace, Order, and Good Government|emergency requiring Federal intervention]] under the ''[[British North America Act]]''. During the annual 1975 Christmas interview with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], Trudeau discussed the economy, citing market failures and stating that more state intervention would be necessary. However, the academic wording and hypothetical solutions posed during the complex discussion led much of the public to believe he had declared capitalism itself a failure, creating a lasting distrust among increasingly [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] business leaders.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=290-94}}

Trudeau continued his attempts at increasing Canada's international profile, including joining the [[G7]] group of major economic powers in 1976 at the behest of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Gerald Ford]].{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|p=?}} On July 14, 1976, after long and emotional debate, Bill C-84 was passed by the House of Commons by a vote of 130 to 124, abolishing the [[Capital punishment in Canada|death penalty]] completely and instituting a life sentence without parole for 25 years for first-degree murder.<ref name="Radio Canada">{{cite web |title = Le grandes etapes de l'abolition |url = http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Dossiers/peinedemort/contenu_bas_03a.asp |publisher = [[Radio Canada]]|language=fr}}</ref>

Trudeau faced increasing challenges in Québec, starting with bitter relations with Bourassa and his [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal]] government in Québec. After a rise in the polls after the rejection of the Victoria Charter, the Québec Liberals had taken a more confrontational approach with the Federal government on the constitution, [[Bill 22|French language laws]], and the language of [[air traffic control]] in Québec.{{sfn|English (2009)|pp=302–306}} Trudeau responded with increasing anger at what he saw as nationalist provocations against the Federal government's bilingualism and constitutional initiatives, at times expressing his personal contempt for Bourassa.{{sfn|English (2009)|pp=302–306}}

Partially in an attempt to shore up his support, Bourassa called a [[1976 Quebec general election|surprise election in 1976]] that resulted in [[René Lévesque]] and the [[Parti Québécois]] (PQ) winning a majority government. The PQ had chiefly campaigned on a "good government" platform, but promised a referendum on independence to be held within their first mandate. Trudeau and Lévesque had been personal rivals, with Trudeau's intellectualism contrasting with Lévesque's more working-class image. While Trudeau claimed to welcome the "clarity" provided by the PQ victory, the unexpected rise of the sovereignist movement became, in his view, his biggest challenge.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=308}}

As the PQ began to take power, Trudeau faced the prolonged failure of his marriage, which was covered in lurid detail on a day-by-day basis by the English language press. Trudeau's reserve was seen as dignified by contemporaries and his poll numbers actually rose during the height of coverage,{{sfn|English (2009)|p=329}} but aides felt the personal tensions left him uncharacteristically emotional and prone to outbursts.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=327-8}}

In 1976, Trudeau, succumbing to pressure from the Chinese government, issued an order barring [[Sports in Taiwan|Taiwan]] from participating as China in the [[1976 Montreal Olympics]], although technically it was a matter for the [[IOC]].<ref name="As It Happens"/>  His action strained relations with the United States – from [[President Ford]], future [[President Carter]] and the press – and subjected Canada to international condemnation and shame.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Trudeau, Taiwan, and the 1976 Montreal Olympics | author=Donald Macintosh, Donna Greenhorn & Michael Hawes | journal= American Review of Canadian Studies | year=1991 | volume=21 | issue=4 | pages=423–448 | doi=10.1080/02722019109481098}}</ref><ref name="As It Happens">{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/taiwan-controversy-at-the-1976-montreal-olympics | title=Montreal Olympics: The Taiwan controversy | publisher=[[CBC Radio One]] | work=[[CBC Archives]]: [[As It Happens]] | date=July 16, 1976 | accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref>

As the 1970s wore on, growing public exhaustion towards Trudeau's personality and the country's constitutional debates caused his poll numbers to fall rapidly in the late 1970s.{{sfn|Gwyn (1980)|p=325}} At the [[1978 G7 summit]], he discussed strategies for the upcoming election with West German Chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]], who advised him to announce several spending cuts to quell criticism of the large deficits his government was running.<ref>[[Lawrence Martin (journalist)|Martin, Lawrence]]. ''Chrétien: The Will to Win'', Toronto: Lester Publishing, 1995 pages 262–264.</ref>

After a series of defeats in by-elections in 1978, Trudeau waited as long as he could to call a statutory general election in 1979. He finally did so in 1979, only two months from the five-year limit provided under the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]]''.<ref name="NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy"/>

====Relations with United States====
Relations deteriorated on many points in the Nixon years (1969–74), including trade disputes, defence agreements, energy, fishing, the environment, cultural imperialism, and foreign policy. They changed for the better when Trudeau and [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter (1977–81)]] found a better rapport. The late 1970s saw a more sympathetic American attitude toward Canadian political and economic needs, the pardoning of draft evaders who had moved to Canada, and the passing of old sore points such as Watergate and the Vietnam War. Canada more than ever welcomed American investments during the "[[stagflation]]" (high inflation and high unemployment at the same time) that hurt both nations in the 1970s.<ref>Lily Gardner Feldman, "Canada and the United States in the 1970s: Rift and Reconciliation." ''The World Today'' 34.12 (1978): 484–492. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40395029 online]</ref>

==Defeat and opposition, 1979–80==
In the [[1979 Canadian federal election|election of 1979]], Trudeau and the Liberals faced declining poll numbers and the [[Joe Clark]]–led Progressive Conservatives focusing on "pocketbook" issues. Trudeau and his advisors, to contrast with the mild-mannered Clark, based their campaign on Trudeau's decisive personality and his grasp of the Constitution file, despite the general public's apparent wariness of both. The traditional Liberal rally at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] saw Trudeau stressing the importance of major constitutional reform to general ennui, and his campaign "photo-ops" were typically surrounded by picket lines and protesters. Though polls portended disaster, Clark's struggles justifying his party's populist platform and a strong Trudeau performance in the election debate helped bring the Liberals to the point of contention.{{sfn|English (2009)|loc=chpt. 13}}

Though winning the popular vote by four points, the Liberal vote was concentrated in Québec and faltered in industrial Ontario, allowing the PCs to win the seat-count handily and form a minority government. Trudeau soon announced his intention to resign as Liberal Party leader and favoured Donald Macdonald to be his successor.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=265}}

However, before a [[leadership convention]] could be held, with Trudeau's blessing and [[Allan MacEachen]]'s manoeuvring in the house, the Liberals supported an NDP subamendment to [[1979 Canadian federal budget|Clark's budget]] stating that the House had no confidence in the budget. In Canada, as in most other countries with a [[Westminster system]], budget votes are indirectly considered to be votes of confidence in the government, and their [[loss of supply|failure]] automatically brings down the government. Liberal and NDP votes and Social Credit abstentions led to the subamendment passing 139–133, thereby toppling Clark's government and triggering a new election for a House less than a year old. The Liberal caucus, along with friends and advisers persuaded Trudeau to stay on as leader and fight the election, with Trudeau's main impetus being the upcoming referendum on Québec sovereignty.{{sfn|Trudeau (1993)|pp=265–66}}

Trudeau and the Liberals engaged in a new strategy for the February 1980 election: facetiously called the "low bridge", it involved dramatically underplaying Trudeau's role and avoiding media appearances, to the point of refusing a televised debate. On election day Ontario returned to the Liberal fold, and Trudeau and the Liberals defeated Clark and won a [[majority government]].<ref>{{cite book |author = Stephen Clarkson |title = The Big Red Machine: How the Liberal Party Dominates Canadian Politics |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rY64Ph2yjWoC&pg=PA103 |year = 2011 |publisher = UBC Press |pages = 87–105 |isbn = 9780774840408 }}</ref>

==Prime Minister, 1980–84==
[[File:Pierre Elliot Trudeau-2.jpg|right|thumb|Prime Minister Trudeau in 1980]]

As a result of the February 18, [[1980 Canadian federal election]], the [[32nd Canadian Parliament]] was controlled by a Liberal Party majority, led by Prime Minister Trudeau and the [[22nd Canadian Ministry]].

The Liberal victory in 1980 highlighted a sharp geographical divide in the country: the party had won no seats west of [[Manitoba]]. Trudeau, in an attempt to represent Western interests, offered to form a coalition government with Ed Broadbent's NDP, which had won 22 seats in the west, but was rebuffed by Broadbent out of fear the party would have no influence in a majority government.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=446-7}}

The first challenge Trudeau faced upon re-election was the May 20, [[1980 Quebec referendum]] on Québec sovereignty, called by the Parti Québécois government under René Lévesque. Trudeau immediately initiated federal involvement in the referendum, reversing the Clark government's policy of leaving the issue to the Québec Liberals and [[Claude Ryan]]. He appointed Jean Chrétien as the nominal spokesman for the federal government, helping to push the "Non" cause to working-class voters who tuned out the intellectual Ryan and Trudeau. Unlike Ryan and the Liberals, he refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the referendum question, and noted that the "association" required consent from the other provinces.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=454}}

In the debates in the legislature during the campaign leading up to the referendum Lévesque said that Trudeau's middle name was Scottish, and that Trudeau's aristocratic upbringing proved that he was more Scottish than French.<ref name="CBC_Reflections_20010923">{{Cite AV media| publisher = Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC),  Melbar Entertainment Group| people = McKenna, Terence (Director), [[Ann-Marie MacDonald]] (Contributor), Michael Bliss (Contributor), [[Jean Chrétien]] (Contributor), [[Joe Clark]](Contributor)| series = Biography| title = Reflections: The Trudeau Legacy| date = September 23, 2001}}</ref> A week prior to the referendum, Trudeau delivered one of his most well-known speeches, in which he extolled the virtues of federalism and questioned the ambiguous language of the referendum question. He described the origin of the name ''Canadian''.<ref name="CBC_Reflections_20010923"/> Trudeau promised a new constitutional agreement should Québec decide to stay in Canada, in which English-speaking Canadians would have to listen to valid concerns made by the Quebecois.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=459}} On May 20, sixty percent of Quebecers voted to remain in Canada. Following the announcement of the results, Trudeau said that he "had never been so proud to be a Quebecer and a Canadian".{{sfn|English (2009)|p=459}}

In their first budget, delivered in October 1980 by Trudeau's long-time loyalist, Finance Minister Allan MacEachen, the [[National Energy Program]] was introduced. It became one of the Liberal's most contentious policies. The NEP was fiercely protested by the Western provinces. The western provinces blamed the devastating oil bust of the 1980s on the NEB which led to what many termed "[[Western alienation]]".

===Patriation of the constitution===

In 1982 Trudeau succeeded in patriating the Constitution.<ref name="NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy"/> The British Parliament passed an act ceding to the Canadian federal government, full responsibility for amending Canada's national charter.<ref name="NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy"/> Earlier in his tenure, he had met with opposition from the provincial governments, most notably with the Victoria Charter. Provincial premiers were united in their concerns regarding an amending formula, a court-enforced Charter of Rights, and a further devolution of powers to the provinces. In 1980, Chrétien was tasked with creating a constitutional settlement following the Québec referendum in which Quebecers voted to remain in Canada.{{sfn|English (2009)|p=459}}

After chairing a series of increasingly acrimonious conferences with first ministers on the issue, Trudeau announced the intention of the federal government to proceed with a request to the British parliament to patriate the constitution, with additions to be approved by a referendum without input from provincial governments. Trudeau was backed by the NDP, Ontario Premier [[Bill Davis]], and New Brunswick Premier [[Richard Hatfield]] and was opposed by the remaining premiers and PC leader Joe Clark. After numerous provincial governments challenged the legality of the decision using their [[Reference question|reference power]], conflicting decisions prompted a [[Patriation Reference|Supreme Court decision]] that stated unilateral patriation was legal, but was in contravention of a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] that the provinces be consulted and have general agreement to the changes.

After the court decision, which prompted some reservations in the British parliament of accepting a unilateral request,<ref>
{{Cite journal |first = Andrew |last = Heard |title = Canadian Independence |year = 1990 |place = Vancouver |publisher = Simon Fraser University |url = https://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/324/Independence.html |accessdate = August 25, 2010 }}</ref> Trudeau agreed to meet with the premiers one more time before proceeding. At the meeting, Trudeau reached an agreement with nine of the premiers on patriating the constitution and implementing the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, with the caveat that provincial legislatures would have the ability to use a [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]] to protect some laws from judicial oversight. The notable exception was Lévesque, who, Trudeau believed, would never have signed an agreement. The objection of the Québec government to the new constitution became a source of continued acrimony between the federal and Québec governments, and would forever stain Trudeau's reputation amongst nationalists in the province.

The ''[[Canada Act]]'', which included the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'' and the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'', was proclaimed by Queen Elizabeth II, as [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]], on April 17, 1982.

===Resignation===
By 1984, the Progressive Conservatives held a substantial lead in opinion polls under their new leader [[Brian Mulroney]], and polls indicated that the Liberals faced all-but-certain defeat if Trudeau led them into the next election.

On February 29, 1984, a day after what he described as a walk through the snowy streets of Ottawa, Trudeau announced he would not lead the Liberals into the next election. He was frequently known to use the term "walk in the snow" as a trope; he claimed to have taken a similar walk in December 1979 before deciding to take the Liberals into the 1980 election.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/trudeaus-third-walk-in-the-snow/|title=Trudeau's third walk in the snow|publisher=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=February 27, 2014}}</ref>

Trudeau formally retired on June 30, ending his 15-year tenure as Prime Minister. He was succeeded by John Turner, a former [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet minister]] under both Trudeau and Lester Pearson. Before handing power to Turner, Trudeau took the unusual step of appointing Liberal [[Senate of Canada|Senators]] from Western provinces to his Cabinet. He advised [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Jeanne Sauvé]] to appoint over 200 Liberals to [[patronage]] positions.  He and Turner then crafted a legal agreement calling for Turner to advise an additional 70 patronage appointments. The sheer volume of appointments, combined with questions about the appointees' qualifications, led to condemnation from across the political spectrum.<ref name="Mulroney 1991">''Mulroney: The Politics of Ambition'', by [[John Sawatsky]], Toronto 1991, McFarlane, Walter, and Ross publishers.</ref> However, an apparent rebound in the polls prompted Turner to call [[1984 Canadian federal election|an election for September 1984]], almost a year before it was due.

Turner's appointment deal with Trudeau came back to haunt the Liberals at the English-language debate, when Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize for not advising that the appointments be cancelled—advice that Sauvé would have been required to follow by convention. Turner claimed that "I had no option" but to let the appointments stand, prompting Mulroney to tell him, "[[You had an option, sir]]–to say 'no'–and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/|title=CBC Archives|website=www.cbc.ca}}</ref>

In the [[1984 Canadian federal election|1984 election]], Mulroney won the largest majority government (by total number of seats) in Canadian history. The Liberals, with Turner as leader, lost 95 seats–at the time, the worst defeat of a sitting government at the federal level. In the [[1993 Canadian federal election]], the Progressive Conservatives faced a larger defeat, when cut to two seats.

==Retirement==
Trudeau joined the Montreal law firm [[Heenan Blaikie]] as counsel and settled in the historic [[Maison Cormier]] in Montreal following his retirement from politics.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Annmarie|last2=Macdonell|first2=Cameron|title=Making Himself at Home: Cormier, Trudeau, and the Architecture of Domestic Masculinity|journal=Winterthur Portfolio|date=2016|volume=50|issue=2/3|pages=151–189|doi=10.1086/689984|s2cid=164255409}}</ref> Though he rarely gave speeches or spoke to the press, his interventions into public debate had a significant impact when they occurred. Trudeau wrote and spoke out against both the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]] proposals to amend the Canadian constitution, arguing that they would weaken federalism and the Charter of Rights if implemented. His opposition to both Accords was considered one of the major factors leading to the defeat of the two proposals.

He also continued to speak against the Parti Québécois and the sovereignty movement with less effect.

Trudeau also remained active in international affairs, visiting foreign leaders and participating in international associations such as the [[Club of Rome]].  He met with Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and other leaders in 1985; shortly afterwards Gorbachev met President [[Ronald Reagan]] to discuss easing world tensions.

He published his memoirs in 1993.<ref name="Trudeau_Memoirs_1993">{{cite book |title=Memoirs |location=Toronto |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |date=1993 |isbn=0-7710-8588-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/memoirs00trud/page/n15/mode/2up |access-date=February 21, 2020}}</ref> The book sold hundreds of thousands of copies in several editions, and became one of the most successful Canadian books ever published.

In his [[old age]], he was afflicted with [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[prostate cancer]], and became less active, although he continued to work at his law practice until a few months before his death at the age of 80. He was devastated by the death of his youngest son, [[Michel Trudeau]], who was killed in an avalanche on November 13, 1998.

==Personal life==

===Religious beliefs===
Trudeau was a Roman Catholic and attended church throughout his life. While mostly private about his beliefs, he made it clear that he was a believer, stating, in an interview with the ''United Church Observer'' in 1971: "I believe in life after death, I believe in God and I'm a Christian." Trudeau maintained, however, that he preferred to impose constraints on himself rather than have them imposed from the outside. In this sense, he believed he was more like a Protestant than a Catholic of the era in which he was schooled.{{sfn|Trudeau (1996)|pp=302–303}}

Michael W. Higgins, a former President of Catholic [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]], researched Trudeau's spirituality and finds that it incorporated elements of three Catholic traditions. The first of these was the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] who provided his education up to the college level. Trudeau frequently displayed the logic and love of argument consistent with that tradition. A second great spiritual influence in Trudeau's life was [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]. According to Michel Gourgues, professor at [[Dominican University College]], Trudeau "considered himself a lay Dominican".{{attribution needed|date=May 2016}} He studied philosophy under Dominican Father [[Louis-Marie Régis]] and remained close to him throughout his life, regarding Régis as "spiritual director and friend". Another skein in Trudeau's spirituality was a [[Contemplation|contemplative]] aspect acquired from his association with the [[Benedictine]] tradition. According to Higgins, Trudeau was convinced of the centrality of [[Christian meditation|meditation]] in a life fully lived. Trudeau meditated regularly after being initiated into [[Transcendental Meditation]] by the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Maharishi : the biography of the man who gave transcendental meditation to the world|last=Mason, Paul, 1952-|isbn=1852305711|location=Shaftesbury, Dorset|oclc=31133549|year = 1994}}</ref> He took retreats at [[Saint-Benoît-du-Lac, Québec]] and regularly attended [[Liturgy of the Hours|Hours]] and the [[Eucharist]] at Montreal's Benedictine community.{{sfn|Higgins, M. (2004)|pp=26–30}}

Although never publicly theological in the way of [[Margaret Thatcher]] or [[Tony Blair]], nor evangelical, in the way of [[Jimmy Carter]] or [[George W. Bush]], Trudeau's spirituality, according to Michael W. Higgins, "suffused, anchored, and directed his inner life. In no small part, it defined him."{{sfn|Higgins, M. (2004)|pp=26–30}}

Trudeau began practising the Japanese martial art [[judo]] sometime in the mid-1950s when he was in his mid-thirties, and by the end of the decade he was [[Judo ranks and grades|ranked]] ''ikkyū'' (brown belt). Later, when he travelled to Japan as Prime Minister, he was promoted to ''shodan'' (first-degree black belt) by the [[Kodokan Judo Institute|Kodokan]], and then promoted to ''nidan'' (second-degree black belt) by [[Masao Takahashi]] in Ottawa before leaving office. Trudeau began the night of his famous "walk in the snow" before announcing his retirement in 1984 by going to judo with his sons.<ref>{{cite web |last = Nurse |first = Paul |title = Pierre Trudeau and Judo? |url = http://www.judoontario.ca/download.php?file=newsletters/newsletter_2009_07_06.pdf |work = The Gentle Way (Volume 6, Issue 4) |publisher = Judo Ontario |accessdate = August 1, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130523053420/http://www.judoontario.ca/download.php?file=newsletters%2Fnewsletter_2009_07_06.pdf |archive-date = May 23, 2013 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

Trudeau's most enduring legacy may lie in his contribution to [[Canadian nationalism]], and of pride in Canada in and for itself rather than as a derivative of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. His role in this effort, and his related battles with Québec on behalf of Canadian unity, cemented his political position when in office despite the controversies he faced—and remain the most remembered aspect of his tenure afterwards.

Some consider Trudeau's economic policies to have been a weak point. Inflation and unemployment marred much of his tenure as prime minister. When Trudeau took office in 1968 Canada had a debt of $18&nbsp;billion (24% of GDP) which was largely left over from World War II, when he left office in 1984, that debt stood at $200&nbsp;billion (46% of GDP), an increase of 83% in real terms.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.csls.ca/data/ipt2006.pdf | title=GDP figures | publisher=Centre for the Study of Living Standards | date=2006 | accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref> However, these trends were present in most western countries at the time, including the United States.

Many politicians still use the term "taking a walk in the snow", the line Trudeau used to describe how he arrived at the decision to leave office in 1984. Other popular Trudeauisms frequently used are "[[just watch me]]", the "[[Finger (gesture)|Trudeau Salute]]", and "[[Fuddle duddle|Fuddle Duddle]]".

One of Trudeau's most enduring legacies is the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution—which replaced Canada's ties to Britain with its own constitution, the 1982 ''1982 Constitution Act''.<ref name="NYT_Kaufman_20000929_Eulogy">{{cite news |newspaper=New York Times |title=Pierre Trudeau Is Dead at 80; Dashing Fighter for Canada |first=Michael T. |last=Kaufman |date=September 29, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/29/world/pierre-trudeau-is-dead-at-80-dashing-fighter-for-canada.html|access-date=February 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525032137/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/29/world/pierre-trudeau-is-dead-at-80-dashing-fighter-for-canada.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |archive-date=May 25, 2013}}</ref>
This included a domestic amending formula and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It is seen as advancing [[civil rights]] and liberties and has become a cornerstone of Canadian values for most Canadians. It also represented the final step in Trudeau's liberal vision of a fully independent Canada based on fundamental human rights and the protection of individual freedoms as well as those of linguistic and cultural minorities. Court challenges based on the Charter of Rights have been used to advance the cause of women's equality, re-establish French school boards in provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, and to mandate the adoption of [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|same-sex marriage]] all across Canada. [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|Section 35]] of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', has clarified issues of aboriginal and equality rights, including establishing the previously denied aboriginal rights of [[Metis (people)|Métis]]. Section 15, dealing with equality rights, has been used to remedy societal discrimination against minority groups. The coupling of the direct and indirect influences of the charter has meant that it has grown to influence every aspect of Canadian life and the override (notwithstanding clause) of the charter has been infrequently used.

[[Canadian conservatism|Canadian conservatives]] claim the constitution has resulted in too much [[judicial activism]] on the part of the courts in Canada. It is also heavily criticized by [[Quebec nationalism|Québec nationalists]], who resent that the 1982 amendments to the constitution were never ratified by any [[Politics of Quebec|Québec government]] and the constitution does not recognize a constitutional veto for Québec.

===Bilingualism===
{{See also|Bilingualism in Canada}}
Bilingualism is one of Trudeau's most lasting accomplishments, having been fully integrated into the Federal government's services, documents, and broadcasting (though not, however, in provincial governments, except for Ontario, New Brunswick, and Manitoba). While official bilingualism has settled some of the grievances Francophones had towards the federal government, many Francophones had hoped that Canadians would be able to function in the official language of their choice no matter where in the country they were.

However, Trudeau's ambitions in this arena have been overstated: Trudeau once said that he regretted the use of the term "bilingualism", because it appeared to demand that all Canadians speak two languages. In fact, Trudeau's vision was to see Canada as a bilingual confederation in which ''all'' cultures would have a place. In this way, his conception broadened beyond simply the relationship of Québec to Canada.

===Multiculturalism===
On October 8, 1971, Pierre Trudeau introduced the Multiculturalism Policy in the House of Commons.  It was the first of its kind in the world,{{sfn|English (2009)|p=142}} and was then emulated in several provinces, such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and other countries most notably Australia, which has had a similar history and immigration pattern.  Beyond the specifics of the policy itself, this action signalled an openness to the world and coincided with a more open immigration policy that had been brought in by Trudeau's predecessor Lester B. Pearson.

===Cultural legacy===
In the last years of his tenure, he ensured both the [[National Gallery of Canada]] and the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] had proper homes in the national capital region. The Trudeau government also implemented programs which mandated [[Canadian content]] in film, and broadcasting, and gave substantial subsidies to develop the Canadian media and cultural industries. Though the policies remain controversial, Canadian media industries have become stronger since Trudeau's arrival.

===Legacy in western Canada===
Trudeau's posthumous reputation in the Western Provinces is notably less favourable than in the rest of English-speaking Canada, and he is sometimes regarded as the "father of Western alienation".  To many westerners, Trudeau's policies seemed to favour other parts of the country, especially [[Ontario]] and Québec, at their expense. Outstanding among such policies was the National Energy Program, which was seen as unfairly depriving western provinces of the full economic benefit from their oil and gas resources, in order to pay for nationwide social programs, and make regional transfer payments to poorer parts of the country. Sentiments of this kind were especially strong in oil-rich [[Alberta]] where unemployment rose from 4% to 10% following passage of the NEP.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Stamp |first=Robert M. |title=Alberta (Economy section) |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |date=23 April 2019 |publisher=Historica Canada |edition=online |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/alberta}}</ref> Estimates have placed Alberta's losses between $50&nbsp;billion and $100&nbsp;billion because of the NEP.<ref>{{cite journal |first = Mary Elizabeth |last = Vicente |title = The National Energy Program |journal = Canada's Digital Collections |publisher = Heritage Community Foundation |year = 2005 |url = http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/events/issues_nep.html |accessdate = April 26, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first = Robert |last = Mansell |author2 = Schlenker, Ron |author3 = Anderson, John |title = Energy, Fiscal Balances and National Sharing |publisher = Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy/[[University of Calgary]] |year = 2005 |url = http://www.iseee.ca/files/iseee/ISEEEResearchReportNov1805.pdf |accessdate = April 26, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626113516/http://www.iseee.ca/files/iseee/ISEEEResearchReportNov1805.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = June 26, 2008 }}</ref>

More particularly, two incidents involving Trudeau are remembered as having fostered Western alienation, and as emblematic of it. During a visit to [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan on July 17, 1969, Trudeau met with a group of farmers who were protesting the [[Canadian Wheat Board]]. The widely remembered perception is that Trudeau dismissed the protesters' concerns with  "Why should ''I'' sell your wheat?"&nbsp;– however, he had asked the [[rhetorical question|question rhetorically]] and then proceeded to answer it himself.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Wilson-Smith |first=Anthony |title=Chrétien Accused of Lying |via=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/chretien-accused-of-lying |magazine=[[Maclean's]] |date=December 23, 1996}}</ref> Years later, on a train trip through [[Salmon Arm, British Columbia]], he "gave the finger" to a group of protesters through the carriage window{{snd}} less widely remembered is that the protesters were shouting anti-French slogans at the train.<ref>Anthony Westell, ''Paradox: Trudeau as Prime Minister''.</ref>

===Legacy in Québec===
Trudeau's legacy in Québec is mixed. Many credit his actions during the October Crisis as crucial in terminating the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) as a force in Québec, and ensuring that the campaign for Québec separatism took a democratic and peaceful route. However, his [[War Measures Act#The October Crisis|imposition of the ''War Measures Act'']]—which received majority support at the time—is remembered by some in Québec and elsewhere as an attack on democracy. Trudeau is also credited by many for the defeat of the 1980 Quebec referendum.

At the federal level, Trudeau faced almost no strong political opposition in Québec during his time as Prime Minister. For instance, his Liberal party captured 74 out of 75 Québec seats in the [[List of Canadian federal general elections|1980 federal election]]. Provincially, though, Québécois twice elected the pro-sovereignty Parti Québécois. Moreover, there were not at that time any pro-sovereignty federal parties such as the [[Bloc Québécois]]. Since the signing of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' in 1982 and until 2015, the Liberal Party of Canada had not succeeded in winning a majority of seats in Québec. He was disliked by the Quebecois nationalists.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070213210244/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/trudeau.htm Pierre Elliott Trudeau, Quebec and the Constitution], marianopolis.edu; retrieved July 7, 2011.</ref>

=== Legacy with respect to indigenous peoples in Canada ===
In 1969, Trudeau along with his then Minister of Indian Affairs Jean Chrétien, proposed the [[1969 White Paper]] (officially entitled Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian policy). Under the legislation of the White Paper, Indian Status would be eliminated. First Nations Peoples would be incorporated fully into provincial government responsibilities as equal Canadian citizens, and reserve status would be removed imposing the laws of private property in indigenous communities. Any special programs or considerations that had been allowed to First Nations people under previous legislation would be terminated, as the special considerations were seen by the Government to act as a means to further separate Indian peoples from Canadian citizens. This proposal was seen by many as racist and an attack on Canada's aboriginal population.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kerr|first=Elisabetta|date=September 2017|title=Pierre Trudeau's White Paper and the Struggle for Aboriginal Rights in Canada|url=https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&context=gljuh|journal=The Great Lakes Journal of Undergraduate History}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facinghistory.org/stolen-lives-indigenous-peoples-canada-and-indian-residential-schools/chapter-8/white-paper-red-paper|title=White Paper, Red Paper|website=Facing History and Ourselves|access-date=July 31, 2019}}</ref> The Paper proposed the general assimilation of First Nations into the Canadian body politic through the elimination of the ''[[Indian Act]]'' and Indian status, the parcelling of reserve land to private owners, and the elimination of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. The White Paper prompted the first major national mobilization of Indian and Aboriginal activists against the federal government's proposal, leading to Trudeau setting aside the legislation.

===Intellectual contributions===
Trudeau was a strong advocate for a [[federalism|federalist]] model of government in Canada, developing and promoting his ideas in response and contrast to strengthening Québec nationalist movements, for instance the social and political atmosphere created during Maurice Duplessis' time in power.<ref>Gagnon (2000).</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}

Federalism in this context can be defined as "a particular way of sharing political power among different peoples within a state...Those who believe in federalism hold that different peoples do not need states of their own in order to enjoy self-determination. Peoples&nbsp;... may agree to share a single state while retaining substantial degrees of self-government over matters essential to their identity as peoples".<ref>Ignatieff, quoted in Balthazar (1995), p. 6.</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}

As a social democrat, Trudeau sought to combine and harmonize his theories on [[social democracy]] with those of federalism so that both could find effective expression in Canada. He noted the ostensible conflict between socialism, with its usually strong centralist government model, and federalism, which expounded a division and cooperation of power by both federal and provincial levels of government.{{sfn|English (2009)|p={{page needed|date=May 2016}}}} In particular, Trudeau stated the following about socialists:{{quote|[R]ather than water down&nbsp;... their socialism, must constantly seek ways of adapting it to a bicultural society governed under a federal constitution. And since the future of Canadian federalism lies clearly in the direction of co-operation, the wise socialist will turn his thoughts in that direction, keeping in mind the importance of establishing buffer zones of joint sovereignty and co-operative zones of joint administration between the two levels of government{{sfn|English (2009)|p=141}}}}

Trudeau pointed out that in sociological terms, Canada is inherently a federalist society, forming unique regional identities and priorities, and therefore a federalist model of spending and jurisdictional powers is most appropriate. He argues, "in the age of the mass society, it is no small advantage to foster the creation of quasi-sovereign communities at the provincial level, where power is that much less remote from the people."{{sfn|English (2009)|p=133}}

Trudeau's idealistic plans for a cooperative Canadian federalist state were resisted and hindered as a result of his narrowness on ideas of identity and socio-cultural pluralism: "While the idea of a 'nation' in the sociological sense is acknowledged by Trudeau, he considers the allegiance which it generates—emotive and particularistic—to be contrary to the idea of cohesion between humans, and as such creating fertile ground for the internal fragmentation of states and a permanent state of conflict".<ref name="Gagnon2000pp16-17">Gagnon (2000), 16–17.</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}

This position garnered significant criticism for Trudeau, in particular from Québec and First Nations peoples on the basis that his theories denied their rights to nationhood.<ref name="Gagnon2000pp16-17"/>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}   First Nations communities raised particular concerns with the proposed 1969 White Paper, developed under Trudeau by Jean Chrétien.

In 1999, CP also named Trudeau "Newsmaker of the 20th Century." Trudeau declined to give CP an interview on that occasion, but said in a letter that he was "surprised and pleased."

==Major biographies==
In 1990, Stephen Clarkson and Christina McCall published a major biography ''Trudeau and Our Times'' in two volumes. Volume 1, ''The magnificent obsession'' reprinted in 1997, was the winner of the Governor General's Award.<ref name="Clarkson_McCall_1997_1">{{cite book  |last1 = Clarkson  |first1 = Stephen  |author-link1 = Stephen Clarkson  |last2 = McCall  |first2 = Christina  |author-link2 = Christina McCall  |title = Trudeau and our times: The magnificent obsession  |orig-year = 1990  |volume = 1  |edition = Revised  |publisher = [[McClelland and Stewart]]  |location = Toronto  |year = 1997  |isbn = 978-0-77105-415-0  |url-access = registration  |url = https://archive.org/details/trudeauourtimes0000unse  }}</ref><ref name="Clarkson_McCall_1997_2">{{cite book | last1  = Clarkson |first1=Stephen  |last2   = McCall |first2=Christina  |title= Trudeau and our times: The heroic delusion  |volume = 2  |edition = Revised  |publisher = McClelland and Stewart  | location  = Toronto  | year= 1997|isbn = 978-0-77105-408-2 |orig-year=1990}}</ref> The most recent reprint was in 2006.

==In film==
Through hours of archival footage and interviews with Trudeau himself, the documentary ''Memoirs'' details the story of a man who used intelligence and charisma to bring together a country that was very nearly torn apart.<ref>{{Citation| publisher = Canadian National Institute for the Blind| last1 = Trudeau| first1 = Pierre Elliott| last2 = Miller| first2 = Peter| title = Memoirs| location = Toronto| date = 1990}}</ref>

Trudeau's life was also depicted in two [[CBC Television]] mini-series. The first one, ''[[Trudeau (film)|Trudeau]]'' (with [[Colm Feore]] in the title role), depicts his years as Prime Minister. ''Trudeau II: Maverick in the Making'' with [[Stéphane Demers]] as the young Pierre, and Tobie Pelletier as him in later years) portrays his earlier life.

The 1999 feature-length documentary by the National Film Board (NFB) entitled ''[[Just Watch Me: Trudeau and the '70s Generation]]'' explores the impact of Trudeau's vision of Canadian bilingualism through interviews with eight Canadians—including John Duffy—on how Trudeau's concept of nationalism and bilingualism affected them personally in the 1970s.<ref name="NFB_JustWatchMe_1999"/>

In the documentary mini-series ''[[The Champions (documentary miniseries)|The Champions]]'' directed by [[Donald Brittain]], Trudeau was the co-subject along with René Lévesque.

In 2001, the CBC produced a full-length documentary entitled ''Reflections''.<ref name="CBC_Reflections_20010923"/>
