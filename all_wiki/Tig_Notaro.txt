===Comedic style===
On her approach to comedy (and whether she considers herself a dark comic): "I'm always going to do whatever I think is funniest. If something's dark, I'll do it. If it's a sock puppet, if it's a stool, I'll do it. There's no preconceived idea of who I think I might be now."<ref name=MotherJones-Interview-2013/> Notaro said that since her cancer diagnosis, she has shifted not to darker comedy but rather to personal comedy.
