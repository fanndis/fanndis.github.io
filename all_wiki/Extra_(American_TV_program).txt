'''''Extra''''' (originally titled '''''Extra: The Entertainment Magazine''''' from 1994 to 1996) is an [[United States|American]] [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[news broadcasting]] [[news magazine|newsmagazine]] that is distributed by [[Warner Bros. Television Studios|Warner Bros. Television Distribution]] and premiered on September 5, 1994. The program serves as a straight rundown of news headlines and gossip throughout the entertainment industry, providing coverage of events and celebrities; however, since 2013, it has also placed an even greater emphasis on interviews and insider previews of upcoming film and television projects. {{As of|2019}}, the program's weekday broadcasts are [[news presenter|anchored]] by [[Billy Bush]], with the weekend editions anchored by [[Renee Bargh]] and [[Jennifer Lahmers]].

==History==
[[File:Victory Studios.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Victory Studios, where ''Extra'' was produced from 1994 to 2010.]]
The series was developed in the fall of 1993, for a planned launch during the 1994–95 television season. The program was developed under the [[working title]] ''Entertainment News Television''; however due to claims that it too closely mirrored its own name, cable channel [[E!]] filed a lawsuit against [[Warner Bros. Television Studios]] and [[Telepictures]] to bar them from using the title; although E! lost the lawsuit in a summary judgment hearing allowing Warner Bros. to continue to use the ''ENT'' title for the series, Warner Bros. decided to change the name of the program to ''Extra: The Entertainment Magazine'' in May 1994, four months before the series made its debut, with Warner Bros. executives citing that the abbreviated ''ENT'' title itself would be too similar to that used by ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', long shortened officially to just ''ET'', possibly leading to viewer confusion and confusing [[Nielsen Media Research]] ratings diary homes which would have seen their panelists writing down the wrong program they watched.<ref>{{cite web|title='Extra': Warner Bros. Renames TV Magazine|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4229144.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105184628/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4229144.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group|Hollinger International]]|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=May 16, 1994|access-date=March 16, 2011}}</ref>

The program was initially anchored by Dave Nemeth and [[Arthel Neville]]. Neville joined the program after being anchor at [[New Orleans]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WVUE-DT]] (now a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate) and a three-year run on ''Extreme Close-Up'', a one-on-one celebrity interview show that she co-produced for [[E!]] Entertainment TV. ''Extra'' was initially distributed by Time-Telepictures Television, a joint venture between [[Time Inc.]] and Telepictures – both of which were owned at the time by [[WarnerMedia|Time Warner]] (which would eventually spin off Time Inc. in 2012) – that was absorbed by Telepictures in 2003. Nemeth and Neville were both replaced by Brad Goode and [[Libby Weaver]] on June 10, 1996 for the remainder of Season 2, and Season 3 (which premiered on September 9, 1996), before Weaver was replaced by [[Maureen O'Boyle]] in July 1997 during Season 3. O'Boyle took over as main anchor of the program in September 1997 during season 4 premiere; following O'Boyle's departure in September 2000, former ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' anchor/correspondent and talk show host [[Leeza Gibbons]] became its main anchor of season 7.

In September 2002, Telepictures debuted a spin-off series, ''[[Celebrity Justice]]''. The program, which was hosted and executive produced by [[Harvey Levin]], had originated as a segment featured on ''Extra'' that focused on legal issues involving celebrities and high-profile court cases with little to no relation to the entertainment industry; ''Celebrity Justice'' ran for three seasons before being cancelled in 2005 (Levin would subsequently launch the celebrity news website [[TMZ]] and three years later, partner with Telepictures and Warner Bros. Television Distribution on a more successful entertainment newsmagazine venture spun off from the site, ''[[TMZ on TV]]'').

Following Gibbons's departure in 2004, ''Extra'' switched to a two-anchor format for the weekday editions with [[Sugar Ray]] lead singer/founder [[Mark McGrath]] and correspondent [[Dayna Devon]] (who was formerly a news anchor/reporter at ABC affiliates [[KMID (TV)|KMID]] and [[WATN-TV]]) taking over as presenters. In September 2007, the production staff of ''Extra'' also began handling production responsibilities for ''[[CW Now]]'', a weekly lifestyle newsmagazine that aired as part of [[The CW]]'s Sunday night lineup; that program was cancelled due to low ratings in February 2008, after 18 episodes, continuing to broadcast some CW interstitial segments for several more months after.

On July 28, 2008, Telepictures announced that actor [[Mario Lopez]] would take over as solo host of the program; Dayna Devon was moved to a correspondent role, while Mark McGrath chose to leave the show and return to his music career.

On September 13, 2010, ''Extra'' began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|high definition]]. the program also abandoned its longtime soundstage at Victory Studios in [[Glendale, California]] and moved its taping location to [[The Grove at Farmers Market]], a well-known shopping and entertainment venue in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Extra|url=http://extratv.warnerbros.com/about/|work=Extra|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]}}</ref>

On August 4, 2011, Telepictures announced that [[Maria Menounos]] (who had previously served as a correspondent for rivals ''Entertainment Tonight'' and ''Access Hollywood'') would join ''Extra'' as Lopez's co-host, as part of an overall deal with Warner Bros./Telepictures that included a role as a contributor for the CW talk show ''[[Drew Pinsky]]'s [[Lifechangers]]'' and development of television program projects.<ref>{{cite web|title=Menounos to Co-Host 'Extra'|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/syndication-and-distribution/menounos-co-host-extra/116378|last=Albaniak|first=Paige|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|publisher=[[NewBay Media]]|date=August 4, 2011}}</ref> On September 9, 2013, at the beginning of its 20th season, ''Extra'' moved its taping location to [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and its [[Universal CityWalk]]; at that time, following Menounos's decision to leave ''Extra'' to become co-host of ''[[E! News]]'', actress/producer [[Tracey Edmonds]] and ''[[SportsNation (TV program)|SportsNation]]''-turned-''[[Fox Sports Live]]'' co-host [[Charissa Thompson]] were added to replace her as co-hosts. Edmonds later left in June 2017. Thompson left at the end of the program's 23rd season.

On August 7, 2017, Telepictures announced co-host changes in preparation for the program's 24th season: former host/correspondent [[Tanika Ray]] would return to ''Extra'' as weekday co-host, with correspondents [[A. J. Calloway]] and current weekend edition host [[Renee Bargh]] also becoming weekday co-hosts. All join fellow host Mario Lopez. British TV personality [[Mark Wright (TV personality)|Mark Wright]] will also join as weekday correspondent.<ref>{{cite web|title='Extra': Tanika Ray, Renee Bargh & AJ Calloway Named New Co-Hosts; Mark Wright Joins As Correspondent|url=https://deadline.com/2017/08/extra-tanika-ray-renee-bargh-aj-calloway-co-host-mark-wright-correspondent-mario-lopez-1202143895/|last=Petski|first=Denise|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=August 7, 2017}}</ref> [[Jerry Penacoli]] serves as an off-air correspondent for the series and is rarely seen, voicing most of the show's segments and stories that are not done from CityWalk.

On May 8, 2019, Telepictures announced a revamp for the program's 26th season, starting September 9, 2019; former ''Access Hollywood'' host [[Billy Bush]] will join as co-host, replacing Mario Lopez—who himself will move to rival ''Access Hollywood''. It will also move to [[The Burbank Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]] where ''Access'' had previously been based. In the months before, Telepictures had signed an agreement with [[Fox Television Stations]] to move the series in a number of major top-10 to top-50 markets to syndication on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] stations, ending a long-term agreement with [[NBC Owned Television Stations]] to syndicate the series to [[NBC]]'s owned and operated stations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Billy Bush to Anchor New Version of 'Extra' in Fall|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/billy-bush-anchor-new-version-extra-fall-1208811|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 8, 2019}}</ref>

On July 31, 2019, Calloway was terminated from ''Extra'' after a number of sexual harassment and assault allegations not involving show staff surfaced (he had previously been suspended earlier in February).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/warner-bros-severs-ties-extra-host-aj-calloway-investigation-assault-claims-1228389|title=Warner Bros.

With Bush's arrival, the series was expected to be retitled ''Extra Extra'' for the new season (the show's title theme had long had "Extra!...Extra!" as its main focal point, supporting the possible change in branding); however like the same issues the series ran into in 1994, it ran into legal issues preventing the change. ''[https://extraextra.biz/ ExtraExtra Show Daily]'', an entertainment industry expo [[trade magazine]], had utilized the title since 1997 under a [[registered trademark symbol]]. ''EESD'' owner Sandra Driggin notified Telepictures about possible confusion with her publication, a week before the show's premiere, and threatened legal action if the show aired as ''Extra Extra''. Telepictures ultimately decided to retain the ''Extra'' name as-is, as the show's staff had not really taken up the new name behind the scenes during off-air rehearsals with Bush.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/billy-bush-s-extra-extra-renamed-legal-threat-1237487|title=Billy Bush's 'Extra Extra' Renamed After Legal Threat|last=Porter|first=Rick|date=September 6, 2019|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=September 7, 2019}}</ref>

On August 27, 2020, it was announced that the twenty-seventh season will premiere on September 8, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=Telepictures Announces "Extra" Season 27 Launches September 8|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2020/08/27/telepictures-announces-extra-season-27-launches-september-8-123113/20200827wbt01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=August 27, 2020}}</ref>
