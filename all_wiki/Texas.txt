It is the second largest [[U.S. state]] by both [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|area]] (after [[Alaska]]) and [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|population]] (after [[California]]). Texas shares borders with the states of [[Louisiana]] to the east, [[Arkansas]] to the northeast, [[Oklahoma]] to the north, [[New Mexico]] to the west, and the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[States of Mexico|states]] of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo León]], and [[Tamaulipas]] to the south and southwest, and has a coastline with the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the southeast.

[[Houston]] is the [[List of cities in Texas by population|most populous city]] in Texas and the [[List of United States cities by population|fourth largest]] in the U.S., while [[San Antonio]] is the second-most populous in the state and seventh largest in the U.S. [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Dallas–Fort Worth]] and [[Greater Houston]] are the fourth and fifth largest [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|metropolitan statistical areas]] in the country, respectively. Other major cities include [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], the second-most populous [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]] in the U.S., and [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]. Texas is nicknamed the "'''Lone Star State'''" for its former status as an [[Republic of Texas|independent republic]], and as a reminder of the state's struggle for independence from [[Mexico]]. The "Lone Star" can be found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.netstate.com/states/intro/tx_intro.htm |title=Introduction to Texas |publisher=Netstate.com |access-date=April 11, 2010}}</ref> The origin of Texas's name is from the word ''táyshaʼ'', which means "friends" in the [[Caddo language]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hanson-Harding|first=Alexandra|title=Texas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PUemv3wa0O8C&pg=PP1|year=2001|publisher=Children's Press|isbn=978-0-516-22322-3}}</ref>

The term "[[six flags over Texas]]"<ref group=note>As used by the large [[Grand Prairie, Texas|Grand Prairie]]-based national and international amusement park operator [[Six Flags]], among others.</ref> refers to several nations that have ruled over the territory. [[Spain]] was the [[Spanish Texas|first European country to claim and control the area]] of Texas. France held a [[French colonization of Texas|short-lived colony]].

After the Civil War and the restoration of its representation in the federal government, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation.

Historically four major industries shaped the Texas economy prior to [[World War II]]: cattle and bison, cotton, timber, and oil.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ramos|first1=Mary G.|last2=Reavis|first2=Dick J.|title=Texas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EgCE8AHvYUQC&pg=PA125|year=2004|publisher=Fodor's Travel Publications|isbn=978-0-676-90502-1|page=125}}</ref> Before and after the U.S. Civil War the cattle industry, which Texas came to dominate, was a major economic driver for the state, thus creating the traditional image of the Texas cowboy. In the later 19th century cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative. It was ultimately, though, the discovery of major [[petroleum]] deposits ([[Spindletop]] in particular) that initiated an [[Texas oil boom|economic boom]] which became the driving force behind the economy for much of the 20th century. With strong investments in universities, Texas developed a diversified [[Economy of Texas|economy]] and [[high tech]] industry in the mid-20th century.

==History==

{{Main|History of Texas}}

===Pre-European era===

{{Texas History}}
{{Further|Pre-Columbian Mexico}}

Texas lies between two major cultural spheres of [[Pre-Columbian North America]]: the [[Southwestern tribes|Southwestern]] and the [[Plains Indians|Plains]] areas. [[Archaeologists]] have found that three major indigenous cultures lived in this territory, and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact. These were:<ref name="Richardson">Richardson (2005), p. 9.</ref>
* the [[Ancestral Puebloans|Pueblo]] from the upper [[Rio Grande]] region, centered west of Texas;
* the [[Mississippian culture]], also known as [[Mound Builders]], which extended along the [[Mississippi River Valley]] east of Texas; and
* the civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], centered south of Texas. Influence of [[Teotihuacan]] in northern Mexico peaked around AD 500 and declined over the 8th to 10th centuries.

When Europeans arrived in the Texas region, there were several races of Native peoples divided into many smaller tribes. They were Caddoan, Atakapan, Athabaskan, Coahuiltecan, and Uto-Aztecan. The Uto-Aztecan Puebloan peoples lived neared the Rio Grande in the western portion of the state, the Athabaskan-speaking Apache tribes lived throughout the interior, the Caddoans controlled much of the Red River region and the Atakapans were mostly centered along the Gulf Coast. At least one tribe of Coahuiltecans, the [[Aranama people|Aranama]], lived in southern Texas. This entire culture group, primarily centered in northeastern Mexico, is now extinct. It is difficult to say who lived in the northwestern region of the state originally. By the time the region came to be explored, it belonged to the fairly well-known Comanche, another Uto-Aztecan people who had transitioned into a powerful horse culture, but it is believed that they came later and did not live there during the 16th century. It may have been claimed by several different peoples, including Uto-Aztecans, Athabaskans, or even Dhegihan Siouans.

No culture was dominant in the present-day Texas region, and many peoples inhabited the area.<ref name="Richardson" /> Native American tribes who lived inside the boundaries of present-day Texas include the [[Alabama people|Alabama]], [[Apache]], [[Atakapa]]n, [[Bidai]], [[Caddo]], Aranama, [[Comanche]], [[Choctaw]], [[Coushatta]], [[Hasinai]], [[Jumano people|Jumano]], [[Karankawa people|Karankawa]], [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]], [[Kiowa]], [[Tonkawa]], and [[Wichita people|Wichita]].<ref>Richardson (2005), pp 10–16</ref><ref name="HoT bzi04">{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=bzi04|title=Indians|first=George |last=Klos|date=June 15, 2010}}</ref> The name ''Texas'' derives from ''táyshaʔ'', a word in the [[Caddoan languages|Caddoan language]] of the ''Hasinai'', which means "friends" or "allies".<ref name="facts">{{cite book |title=Facts |edition=2010–2011 |work=[[Texas Almanac]] |url=http://texasalmanac.com/topics/facts-profile |first=Robert |last=Plocheck |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228054833/http://www.texasalmanac.com/topics/facts-profile |archive-date=February 28, 2011 |date=November 20, 2017 }}</ref><ref name="TribesofTexas">{{cite Handbook of Texas |last=Fry |first=Phillip L. |title=Texas, Origin of Name |id=pft04 |orig-year=July 15, 2010 |date=March 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>Richardson, p 1</ref><ref name="etymology">{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Texas |title=Texas |access-date=February 25, 2007 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper}}</ref><ref name="WChafe">Wallace Chafe, p.c.</ref>
[[File:Early indian west.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Early Native American tribal territories]]
The region was primarily controlled by the Spanish for the first couple centuries of contact, until the Texas Revolution. They were not particularly kind to their native populations—even less so with the Caddoans, who were not trusted as their culture was split between the Spanish and the French. When the Spanish briefly managed to conquer the Louisiana colony, they decided to switch tactics and attempt being exceedingly friendly to the Indians, which they continued even after the French took back the colony. After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the United States inherited this odd circumstance. The Caddoans preferred the company of Americans{{According to whom|date=March 2019}} and almost the entire population of them migrated into the states of Louisiana and Arkansas. The Spanish felt jilted after having spent so much time and effort and began trying to lure the Caddo back, even promising them more land. Seemingly without actually knowing how they came by it,{{According to whom|date=March 2019}} the United States (who had begun convincing tribes to self-segregate from whites by selling everything and moving west ever since they gained the Louisiana Purchase) faced an overflow of native peoples in Missouri and Arkansas and were able to negotiate with the Caddoans to allow several displaced peoples to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas. They included the [[Muscogee]], [[Houma people|Houma Choctaw]], [[Lenape]] and [[Mingo | Mingo Seneca]], among others, who all came to view the Caddoans as saviors, making those peoples highly influential.<ref name="ReferenceA">Glover, William B. "A History of the Caddo Indians". Reprinted from 'The Louisiana Historical Quarterly'; Vol. 18, No. 4. October 1935</ref><ref>Swanton, John R. Indians of the Southeastern United States (Washington: United States Government Printing Office, 1946) p. 139</ref>

Whether a Native American tribe was friendly or warlike was critical to the fates of European explorers and [[settler]]s in that land.<ref>Richardson, p 10</ref> Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunt [[game (food)|wild game]]. Warlike tribes made life difficult and dangerous for Europeans through their attacks and resistance to the newcomers.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Rupert N. |last1=Richardson |first2=Adrian |last2=Anderson |first3=Cary D. |last3=Wintz |first4=Ernest |last4=Wallace |title=Texas: the Lone Star State |edition=9th |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-1318-3550-4 |pp=10–16|year=2005 }}</ref>

During the Texas Revolution, the U.S. became heavily involved. Prior treaties with the Spanish forbade either side from militarizing its native population in any potential conflict between the two nations. At that time, several sudden outbreaks of violence between Caddoans and Texans started to spread. The Caddoans were always clueless{{speculation inline|date=March 2019}} when questioned, The Texan and American authorities in the region could never find hard evidence linking them to it and often it was so far-flung from Caddoan lands, it barely made any sense. It seems most likely that these were false-flag attacks meant to start a cascading effect to force the natives under Caddoan influence into armed conflict without breaking any treaties—preferably on the side of the Spanish. While no proof was found as to who the culprit was, those in charge of Texas at the time attempted multiple times to publicly blame and punish the Caddoans for the incidents with the U.S. government trying to keep them in check. Furthermore, the Caddoans never turned to violence because of it, excepting cases of self-defense.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

By the 1830s, the U.S. had drafted the Indian Removal Act, which was used to facilitate the Trail of Tears. Fearing retribution of other native peoples, Indian Agents all over the eastern U.S. began desperately trying to convince all their native peoples to uproot and move west. This included the Caddoans of Louisiana and Arkansas. Following the Texas Revolution, the Texans chose to make peace with their Native peoples but did not honor former land claims or agreements. This began the movement of Native populations north into what would become Indian Territory—modern-day Oklahoma.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

[[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado]] describes his 1541 encounter:
{{quote |text=Two kinds of people travel around these plains with the cows; one is called [[Querecho Indians|Querechos]] and the others [[Teyas Indians|Teyas]]; they are very well built, and painted, and are enemies of each other. They have no other settlement or location than comes from traveling around with the cows. They kill all of these they wish and tan the hides, with which they clothe themselves and make their tents, and they eat the flesh, sometimes even raw, and they also even drink the blood when thirsty. The tents they make are like field tents, and they set them up over poles they have made for this purpose, which come together and are tied at the top, and when they go from one place to another they carry them on some dogs they have, of which they have many, and they load them with the tents and poles and other things, for the country is so level, as I said, that they can make use of these, because they carry the poles dragging along on the ground.

European powers ignored the area until accidentally settling there in 1685. Miscalculations by [[René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle]] resulted in his establishing the colony of [[French colonization of Texas|Fort Saint Louis]] at [[Matagorda Bay]] rather than along the [[Mississippi River]].{{sfnp|Weber|1992|p=149}} The colony lasted only four years before succumbing to harsh conditions and hostile natives.{{Sfnp|Chipman|1992|p=83}}

In 1690 Spanish authorities, concerned that France posed a competitive threat, constructed several [[Spanish missions in Texas|missions]] in [[East Texas]].{{sfnp|Chipman|1992|p=89}} After Native American resistance, the Spanish missionaries returned to Mexico.{{sfnp|Weber|1992|p=155}} When France began settling [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], mostly in the southern part of the state, in 1716 Spanish authorities responded by founding a new series of missions in East Texas.<ref>{{harvp|Chipman|1992|pp=111–112}}; {{harvp|Weber|1992|p=160}}</ref> Two years later, they created [[San Antonio]] as the first Spanish civilian settlement in the area.{{sfnp|Weber|1992|p=163}}

Hostile native tribes and distance from nearby Spanish colonies discouraged settlers from moving to the area. It was one of New Spain's least populated provinces.{{sfnp|Chipman|1992|p=205}} In 1749, the Spanish peace treaty with the [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan Apache]]{{sfnp|Weber|1992|p=193}} angered many tribes, including the [[Comanche]], [[Tonkawa]], and [[Hasinai]].{{sfnp|Weber|1992|p=189}} The Comanche signed a treaty with Spain in 1785{{sfnp|Weddle|1995|p=163}} and later helped to defeat the Lipan Apache and [[Karankawa people|Karankawa]] tribes.<ref>{{harvp|Weddle|1995|p=164}}; {{harvp|Chipman|1992|p=200}}</ref> With more numerous missions being established, priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes.

When the United States [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased Louisiana]] from France in 1803, American authorities insisted the agreement also included Texas. The boundary between New Spain and the United States was finally set at the [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine River]] in 1819, at what is now the border between Texas and Louisiana.{{sfnp|Weber|1992|pp=291–299}} Eager for new land, many United States settlers refused to recognize the agreement. Several [[filibuster (military)|filibusters]] raised armies to invade the area west of the Sabine River.{{sfnp|Davis|2006|p=46}} In 1821, the [[Mexican War of Independence]] included the Texas territory, which became part of Mexico.{{sfnp|Weber|1992|p=300}} Due to its low population, Mexico made the area part of the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]].{{sfnp|Manchaca|2001|p=162}}

Hoping more settlers would reduce the near-constant Comanche raids, [[Mexican Texas]] liberalized its immigration policies to permit immigrants from outside Mexico and Spain.{{sfnp|Manchaca|2001|p=164}} Under the Mexican immigration system, large swathes of land were allotted to ''[[empresario]]s'', who recruited settlers from the United States, Europe, and the Mexican interior. The first grant, to [[Moses Austin]], was passed to his son [[Stephen F. Austin]] after his death.

Austin's settlers, the [[Old Three Hundred]], made places along the [[Brazos River]] in 1822.{{sfnp|Manchaca|2001|p=198}} Twenty-three other empresarios brought settlers to the state, the majority of whom were from the United States.{{sfnp|Manchaca|2001|pp=198-199}} The population of Texas grew rapidly. In 1825, Texas had about 3,500 people, with most of Mexican descent.{{sfnp|Edmondson|2000|p=75}} By 1834, the population had grown to about 37,800 people, with only 7,800 of Mexican descent.{{sfnp|Manchaca|2001|p=172, 201}} Most of these early settlers who arrived with Austin and soon after were persons less than fortunate in life, as Texas was devoid of the comforts found elsewhere in Mexico and the United States during that time. Early Texas settler David B. Edwards described his fellow Texans as being "banished from the pleasures of life".<ref>http://www.publishinghau5.com/The-History-of-Texas-page-9.php{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Many immigrants openly flouted Mexican law, especially the prohibition against [[slavery]]. Combined with United States' attempts to purchase Texas, Mexican authorities decided in 1830 to prohibit continued immigration from the United States.{{sfnp|Edmondson|2000|p=78}} [[Illegal immigration]] from the United States into Mexico continued to increase the population of Texas anyway.{{sfnp|Manchaca|2001|p=200}} New laws also called for the enforcement of [[duty (economics)|customs duties]] angering native Mexican citizens (''[[Tejano]]s'') and recent immigrants alike.{{sfnp|Davis|2006|p=77}}

The [[Anahuac Disturbances]] in 1832 were the first open revolt against Mexican rule, and they coincided with a revolt in Mexico against the nation's president.{{sfnp|Davis|2006|p=85}} [[Texian]]s sided with the [[federalism|federalists]] against the current government and drove all Mexican soldiers out of East Texas.{{sfnp|Davis|2006|pp=86–89}} They took advantage of the lack of oversight to agitate for more political freedom. Texians met at the [[Convention of 1832]] to discuss requesting independent statehood, among other issues.{{sfnp|Davis|2006|p=92}} The following year, Texians reiterated their demands at the [[Convention of 1833]].<ref>{{cite Handbook of Texas |id=mjc10 |title=Convention of 1833 |first=Ralph W. |last=Steen |date=June 12, 2010}}</ref>

While Texas had won its independence, political battles raged between two factions of the new Republic. The nationalist faction, led by [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], advocated the continued independence of Texas, the expulsion of the Native Americans, and the expansion of the Republic to the Pacific Ocean. Their opponents, led by Sam Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co-existence with Native Americans. The conflict between the factions was typified by an incident known as the [[Texas Archive War]].<ref name="archivewar">{{cite web |title=The Archives War |website=Texas Treasures- The Republic |publisher=The Texas State Library and Archives Commission |date=November 2, 2005 |url=https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/treasures/republic/archwar/archwar.html |access-date=January 3, 2009}}</ref> With wide popular support, Texas first applied for annexation to the United States in 1836, but its status as a slaveholding country caused its admission to be controversial and it was initially rebuffed.

The population of the new state was quite small at first, and there was a strong mix between the English-speaking American settlers who dominated in the state's eastern/northeastern portions and the Spanish-speaking former Mexicans ([[Tejanos]]) who dominated in the state's southern and western portions. Statehood brought many new settlers. Because of the long Spanish presence in Mexico and various failed colonization efforts by the Spanish and Mexicans in northern Mexico, there were large herds of [[Texas Longhorn|Longhorn cattle]] that roamed the state. Hardy by nature, but also suitable for slaughtering and consumption, they represented an economic opportunity many entrepreneurs seized upon, thus creating the cowboy culture for which Texas is famous. While in the early days of the republic cattle and bison were slaughtered for their hides, soon a beef industry was established with cattle being shipped all over the U.S. and the Caribbean (within a few decades, beef had become a staple of the American diet). 
[[File:Texas proposed boundaries.svg|thumb|left|Proposed boundaries, 1850]]

After Texas's annexation, Mexico broke diplomatic relations with the United States. While the United States claimed Texas's border stretched to the Rio Grande, Mexico claimed it was the [[Nueces River]] leaving the [[Rio Grande Valley]] under contested Texan sovereignty.<ref name="TAnnexation" /> While the former Republic of Texas could not enforce its border claims, the United States had the military strength and the political will to do so. President Polk ordered General [[Zachary Taylor]] south to the Rio Grande on January 13, 1846. A few months later Mexican troops routed an American cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the [[Thornton Affair]] starting the [[Mexican–American War]]. The first battles of the war were fought in Texas: the [[Siege of Fort Texas]], [[Battle of Palo Alto]] and [[Battle of Resaca de la Palma]]. After these decisive victories, the United States invaded Mexican territory, ending the fighting in Texas.<ref name="Mwar">{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=qdm02|title=Mexican War|first= K. Jack |last=Bauer|orig-year=June 15, 2010 |date=March 28, 2016}}</ref>

After a series of United States victories, the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] ended the two-year war. In return, for US$18,250,000, Mexico gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, ceded the [[Mexican Cession]] in 1848, most of which today is called the American Southwest, and Texas's borders were established at the Rio Grande.<ref name="Mwar" />

The [[Compromise of 1850]] set Texas's boundaries at their present form. U.S. Senator [[James Pearce]] of Maryland drafted the final proposal<ref name="comp1850" /> where Texas ceded its claims to land which later became half of present-day [[New Mexico]], a third of [[Colorado]], and small portions of [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Wyoming]] to the federal government, in return for the assumption of $10&nbsp;million of the old republic's debt.<ref name="comp1850">{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=nbc02|title=Compromise of 1850|first=Roger A. |last=Griffin|orig-year=June 12, 2010 |date=March 21, 2016}}</ref> Post-war Texas grew rapidly as migrants poured into the cotton lands of the state.<ref name="CCulture">{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=afc03|title=Cotton Culture|first1=Karen Gerhardt |last1=Britton |first2=Fred C. |last2=Elliott |first3=E.

On February 1, by a vote of 166–8, the Convention adopted an [[Ordinance of Secession]] from the United States. Texas voters approved this Ordinance on February 23, 1861.

Not all Texans favored secession initially, although many of the same would later support the Southern cause. Texas's most notable [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionist]] was the state Governor, [[Sam Houston]]. Not wanting to aggravate the situation, Houston refused two offers from President Lincoln for Union troops to keep him in office.

Like most of the South, the Texas economy was devastated by the War. However, since the state had not been as dependent on slaves as other parts of the South, it was able to recover more quickly. The culture in Texas during the later 19th century exhibited many facets of a frontier territory. The state became notorious as a haven for people from other parts of the country who wanted to escape debt, criminal prosecution, or other problems. Indeed, "Gone to Texas" was a common expression for those fleeing the law in other states. Nevertheless, the state also attracted many businessmen and other settlers with more legitimate interests as well.

The cattle industry continued to thrive, though it gradually became less profitable. Cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various regions of the state. Railroad networks grew rapidly as did the port at Galveston as commerce between Texas and the rest of the U.S. (and the rest of the world) expanded. As with some other states before, the lumber industry quickly decimated the [[History of Texas forests|forests of Texas]] such that, by the early 20th century, the majority of the forest population in Texas was gone (later conservation efforts restored some of it, but never to the level it once was).

In 1900, Texas suffered the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history during the [[1900 Galveston hurricane|Galveston hurricane]].<ref name="deadhurr" /> On January 10, 1901, the first major [[oil well]] in Texas, [[Spindletop]], was found south of [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]]. Other fields were later discovered nearby in [[East Texas Oil Field|East Texas]], [[West Texas]], and under the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

In 1901, the Democratic-dominated state legislature passed a bill requiring payment of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] for voting, which effectively [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites and [[Latinos]]. In addition, the legislature established [[white primaries]], ensuring minorities were excluded from the formal political process. The number of voters dropped dramatically, and the Democrats crushed competition from the Republican and Populist parties.<ref name="yale">{{cite journal |jstor=791091 |title=Nixon v. Condon.

The [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] dealt a double blow to the state's economy, which had significantly improved since the Civil War. Migrants abandoned the worst-hit sections of Texas during the Dust Bowl years. Especially from this period on, blacks left Texas in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to get work in the Northern United States or California and to escape the oppression of segregation.<ref name=HOT/> In 1940, Texas was 74 percent [[Non-Hispanic Whites|Anglo]], 14.4 percent black, and 11.5 percent Hispanic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jillson|first=Cal|title=Texas Politics: Governing the Lone Star State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQFZCrbc9mIC&pg=PA11|year=2011|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-82941-7|page=11}}</ref>

World War II had a dramatic impact on Texas, as federal money poured in to build military bases, munitions factories, POW detention camps and Army hospitals; 750,000 young men left for service; the cities exploded with new industry; the colleges took on new roles; and hundreds of thousands of poor farmers left the fields for much better-paying war jobs, never to return to agriculture.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=James Ward|last2=Barnes|first2=Carolyn N.|last3=Bowman|first3=Kent Adam|title=1941: Texas Goes to War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JwBnAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1|year=1991|publisher=University of North Texas Press|isbn=978-0-929398-29-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Fairchild|first=Louis|title=They Called It the War Effort: Oral Histories from World War II Orange, Texas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=syZDE5pBzjoC&pg=PP1|edition=second|year=2012|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|isbn=978-0-87611-259-5}}</ref> Texas manufactured 3.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking eleventh among the 48 states.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Peck|first1=Merton J.|author-link1=Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|last2=Scherer|first2=Frederic M.|author-link2=Frederic M.

Texas modernized and expanded its [[Education in Texas#Public colleges and universities|system of higher education]] through the 1960s. The state created a comprehensive plan for higher education, funded in large part by oil revenues, and a central state apparatus designed to manage state institutions more efficiently. These changes helped Texas universities receive federal research funds.<ref name="Blanton">{{cite journal |last=Blanton |first=Carlos Kevin |title=The Campus and the Capitol: John B.

{{Main|Geography of Texas}}
[[File:Sam Rayburn Reservoir.jpg|thumb|[[Sam Rayburn Reservoir]]]]
[[File:Texas hill country.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Texas Hill Country]]]]
Texas is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|second-largest]] U.S. state, after [[Alaska]], with an area of {{convert|268820|sqmi|km2}}. Though 10% [[List of countries by area|larger than France]] and almost twice as large as [[Germany]] or [[Japan]] and more than twice the size of the [[United Kingdom]], it ranks only 27th worldwide amongst [[List of the largest country subdivisions by area|country subdivisions by size]]. If it were an independent country, Texas would be the [[List of countries by area|40th largest]] behind [[Chile]] and [[Zambia]].

Texas is in the [[South Central United States|south central]] part of the United States of America. Three of its borders are defined by rivers. The [[Rio Grande]] forms a natural border with the Mexican states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo León]], and [[Tamaulipas]] to the south. The [[Red River of the South|Red River]] forms a natural border with Oklahoma and Arkansas to the north. The [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine River]] forms a natural border with Louisiana to the east. The [[Texas Panhandle]] has an eastern border with Oklahoma at [[100th meridian west|100° W]], a northern border with Oklahoma at [[Parallel 36°30' north|36°30' N]] and a western border with New Mexico at [[103rd meridian west|103° W]]. [[El Paso]] lies on the state's western tip at [[32nd parallel north|32° N]] and the Rio Grande.<ref name="comp1850" />

With 10 [[Köppen climate classification|climatic regions]], 14 [[Agricultural soil science|soil regions]] and 11 distinct [[Ecoregion|ecological regions]], regional classification becomes problematic with differences in soils, topography, geology, rainfall, and plant and animal communities.<ref name="Tx eco regions">{{cite web |url=http://www.texasep.org/html/lnd/lnd_1reg.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603175718/http://www.texasep.org/html/lnd/lnd_1reg.html |archive-date=June 3, 2008 |title=Tx Environmental Profiles |access-date=July 14, 2006}}</ref> One classification system divides Texas, in order from southeast to west, into the following: [[Gulf Coastal Plains]], Interior Lowlands, [[Great Plains]], and Basin and Range Province.

The Gulf Coastal Plains region wraps around the Gulf of Mexico on the southeast section of the state. Vegetation in this region consists of thick piney woods. The Interior Lowlands region consists of gently rolling to hilly forested land and is part of a larger pine-hardwood forest.

[[File:Martin-Dies-Jr-State-Park.jpg|thumb|[[Steinhagen Reservoir]]]]

The Great Plains region in central Texas spans through the state's [[Texas Panhandle|panhandle]] and [[Llano Estacado]] to the state's [[Texas Hill Country|hill country]] near Austin. This region is dominated by [[prairie]] and [[steppe]]. "Far West Texas" or the "[[Trans-Pecos]]" region is the state's Basin and Range Province. The most varied of the regions, this area includes Sand Hills, the Stockton Plateau, desert valleys, wooded mountain slopes and desert grasslands.

Texas has 3,700 named streams and 15 major rivers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/landwater/water/habitats/rivers/ |title=Rivers in Texas |publisher=Tpwd.state.tx.us |date=November 16, 2007 |access-date=April 11, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite Handbook of Texas |first=Hal P. |last=Bybee |id=rnr07 |title=Rivers |date=June 15, 2010}}</ref> with the [[Rio Grande]] as the largest. Other major rivers include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]], the [[Brazos River|Brazos]], [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado]], and [[Red River of the South|Red River]]. While Texas has few natural lakes, Texans have built more than a hundred [[List of lakes in Texas|artificial reservoirs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tpwd.texas.gov/fishboat/fish/recreational/lakes/lakelist.phtml |title=Alphabetical List of Texas Lakes |publisher=Tpwd.state.tx.us |date=January 28, 2010 |access-date=April 11, 2010}}</ref>

The size and unique history of Texas make its regional affiliation debatable; it can be fairly considered a Southern or a Southwestern state, or both. The vast geographic, economic, and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a [[List of regions of the United States|recognized region of the United States]]. Notable extremes range from [[East Texas]] which is often considered an extension of the [[Deep South]], to [[Trans-Pecos|Far West Texas]] which is generally acknowledged to be part of the [[Southwestern United States|interior Southwest]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/is-texas-southern-western-or-truly-a-lone-star/ |website=[[Texas Monthly]] |title=Is Texas Southern, Western, or Truly a Lone Star? |last=Nova Lomax |first=John |date=March 3, 2015 |access-date=September 6, 2016}}</ref>

Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] of Mexico. The [[continental crust]] forms a stable [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[craton]] which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true [[oceanic crust]] of the Gulf of Mexico. The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600&nbsp;million years old.

These [[Precambrian]] [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s underlie most of the state, and are exposed in three places: [[Llano, Texas|Llano]] uplift, [[Van Horn, Texas|Van Horn]], and the [[Franklin Mountains (Texas)|Franklin Mountains]], near El Paso. [[Sedimentary rocks]] overlay most of these ancient rocks. The oldest sediments were deposited on the flanks of a rifted continental margin, or [[passive margin]] that developed during [[Cambrian]] time.

This margin existed until [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]] collided in the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod to form [[Pangea]]. This is the buried crest of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]–[[Ouachita Mountains]] zone of Pennsylvanian [[continental collision]]. This [[orogeny|orogenic]] crest is today buried beneath the Dallas–[[Waco, Texas|Waco]]—Austin–San Antonio trend.

The late [[Paleozoic]] mountains collapsed as [[rifting]] in the [[Jurassic]] period began to open the Gulf of Mexico. Pangea began to break up in the [[Triassic]], but [[seafloor spreading]] to form the Gulf of Mexico occurred only in the mid- and [[late Jurassic]]. The shoreline shifted again to the eastern margin of the state and the Gulf of Mexico's passive margin began to form.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Texas}}
[[File:Texas Köppen.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Köppen climate types in Texas]]

The large size of Texas and its location at the intersection of multiple [[Köppen climate classification|climate zones]] gives the state highly variable weather. The [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]] of the state has colder winters than North Texas, while the Gulf Coast has mild winters. Texas has wide variations in precipitation patterns. El Paso, on the western end of the state, averages {{convert|8.7|in|mm}} of annual rainfall,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=7227&refer=&cityname=El-Paso-Texas-United-States-of-America |title=El Paso, Texas Travel Weather Averages |publisher=Weatherbase |access-date=April 18, 2013}}</ref> while parts of southeast Texas average as much as {{convert|64|in|mm}} per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=86614&refer=&cityname=Mauriceville-Texas-United-States-of-America |title=Mauriceville, Texas Travel Weather Averages |publisher=Weatherbase |access-date=April 18, 2013}}</ref> Dallas in the North Central region averages a more moderate {{convert|37|in|mm}} per year.

Snow falls multiple times each winter in the Panhandle and mountainous areas of West Texas, once or twice a year in North Texas, and once every few years in Central and East Texas. Snow falls south of San Antonio or on the coast only in rare circumstances. Of note is the [[2004 Christmas Eve snowstorm]], when {{convert|6|in|mm}} of snow fell as far south as [[Kingsville, Texas|Kingsville]], where the average high temperature in December is 65&nbsp;°F.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KNQI/2008/12/24/DailyHistory.html?req_city=NA&req_state=NA&req_statename=NA |title=History : Weather Underground |publisher=Wunderground.com |date=December 24, 2008 |access-date=April 11, 2010}}</ref>

Maximum temperatures in the summer months average from the 80s °[[Fahrenheit|F]] (26&nbsp;°C) in the mountains of West Texas and on [[Galveston Island]] to around {{convert|100|°F|°C|0}} in the [[Rio Grande Valley]], but most areas of Texas see consistent summer high temperatures in the {{convert|90|°F|°C|0}} range.

Night-time summer temperatures range from the upper 50s °F (14&nbsp;°C) in the West Texas mountains to {{convert|80|°F|°C|0}} in Galveston.<ref name="weather2">{{cite web |title=Monthly Averages for Marfa, Texas |publisher=The Weather Channel |url=https://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USTX0830?from=search |access-date=October 15, 2008}}</ref><ref name="weather3">{{cite web |title=Monthly Averages for Galveston, Texas |publisher=The Weather Channel |url=https://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USTX0499?from=search |access-date=October 15, 2008}}</ref>

===Storms===

[[Thunderstorm]]s strike Texas often, especially the eastern and northern portions of the state. [[Tornado Alley]] covers the northern section of Texas. The state experiences the most [[tornado]]es in the United States, an average of 139 a year. These strike most frequently in North Texas and the Panhandle.<ref name="Annual average number of tornadoes">[https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif NOOA.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423020857/https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |date=April 23, 2017 }} National Climatic Data Center.

Some of the most destructive hurricanes in U.S. history have impacted Texas. A hurricane in 1875 killed about 400 people in [[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]], followed by [[1886 Indianola hurricane|another hurricane]] in 1886 that destroyed the town. These events allowed [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] to take over as the chief port city. The [[1900 Galveston hurricane]] subsequently devastated that city, killing about 8,000 people or possibly as many as 12,000.

Although Texas permits cities and counties to enter "interlocal agreements" to share services, the state does not allow [[consolidated city-county]] governments, nor does it have [[metropolitan government]]s. Counties are not granted [[home rule]] status; their powers are strictly defined by state law. The state does not have townships—areas within a county are either incorporated or unincorporated. Incorporated areas are part of a municipality. The county provides limited services to unincorporated areas and to some smaller incorporated areas. Municipalities are classified either "general law" cities or "home rule".<ref name="homerule">{{cite thesis |last=McDonald |first=John V. |title=An Analysis of Texas' Municipal Home Rule Charters Since 1994" |date=August 2000 |publisher=Texas State University |url=http://ecommons.txstate.edu/arp/124/}}</ref> A municipality may elect home rule status once it exceeds 5,000 population with voter approval.

Texas also permits the creation of "special districts", which provide limited services.

{{Main|Culture of Texas}}
{{See also|List of people from Texas|List of Texas symbols}}
[[File:Mission San Antonio aka Alamo.jpg|thumb|[[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|The Alamo]] is one of the most recognized symbols of Texas.]]

Historically, Texas culture comes from a blend of Southern [[Southern United States|(Dixie)]], Western (frontier), and Southwestern [[Southwestern United States|(Mexican/Anglo fusion)]] influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another. Texas is placed in the [[Southern United States]] by the [[United States Census Bureau]].<ref name=regdiv>{{cite web|url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf |title=Census Regions and Divisions of the United States |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=July 2, 2016}}</ref> A popular food item, the [[breakfast burrito]], draws from all three, having a soft flour tortilla wrapped around bacon and scrambled eggs or other hot, cooked fillings. Adding to Texas's traditional culture, established in the 18th and 19th centuries, immigration has made Texas a [[melting pot]] of cultures from around the world.

Texas has made a strong mark on national and international pop culture. The entire state is strongly associated with the image of the [[cowboy]] shown in [[westerns]] and in [[country western music]]. The state's numerous oil tycoons are also a popular pop culture topic as seen in the hit TV series [[Dallas (1978 TV series)|''Dallas'']].

The internationally known slogan "[[Don't Mess with Texas]]" began as an anti-littering [[advertising campaign|advertisement]]. Since the campaign's inception in 1986, the phrase has become "an identity statement, a declaration of Texas swagger".<ref name=DMWTexas>{{cite news |last=Fernandez |first=Manny |title=Not to Be, Um, Trifled With, Texas Guards Its Slogans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/us/not-to-be-um-trifled-with-texas-guards-its-slogans.html?_r=0 |access-date=December 29, 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 14, 2013}}</ref>

===Railroads===

{{See also|List of Texas railroads}}Part of the state's [[Cowboy#Texas tradition|tradition]] of cowboys is derived from the massive [[Cattle drives in the United States|cattle drives]] which its ranchers organized in the nineteenth century to [[Cattle drives in the United States|drive]] livestock to railroads and markets in Kansas, for shipment to the East. Towns along the way, such as [[Baxter Springs, Kansas|Baxter Springs]], the first cow town in Kansas, developed to handle the seasonal workers and tens of thousands of head of cattle being driven.

The first railroad to operate in Texas was the [[Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway]], opening in August 1853.<ref>{{cite Handbook of Texas |first=George C. |last=Werner |id=eqb16 |title=Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway |date=June 12, 2010}}</ref> The first railroad to enter Texas from the north, completed in 1872, was the {{nowrap|[[Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad]]}}.<ref>{{cite Handbook of Texas |first=Donovan L. |last=Hofsommer |id=eqm08 |title=Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad |date=June 15, 2010}}</ref> With increasing railroad access, the ranchers did not have to take their livestock up to the Midwest and shipped beef out from Texas. This caused a decline in the economies of the cow towns.

Since 1911, Texas has led the nation in length of railroad miles within the state. Texas railway length peaked in 1932 at {{convert|17078|mi|km}}, but declined to {{convert|14006|mi|km}} by 2000. While the [[Railroad Commission of Texas]] originally regulated state railroads, in 2005 the state reassigned these duties to TxDOT.<ref name="RRCMove">{{cite web|title=Former Rail Division |publisher=Texas Railroad Commission |date=October 1, 2005 |url=http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/divisions/rail_moved/index.html?/rail.html |access-date=May 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506073304/http://www.rrc.state.tx.us/divisions/rail_moved/index.html?%2Frail.html |archive-date=May 6, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the Dallas–Fort Worth area, three public transit agencies provide rail service: [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART), [[Denton County Transportation Authority]] (DCTA), and [[Trinity Metro]].

[[Amtrak]] provides Texas with limited intercity passenger rail service. Three scheduled routes serve the state: the daily ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' {{nowrap|(Chicago–San Antonio)}}; the tri-weekly ''[[Sunset Limited]]'' {{nowrap|(New Orleans–Los Angeles)}}, with stops in Texas; and the daily ''[[Heartland Flyer]]'' {{nowrap|(Fort Worth–Oklahoma City)}}. Texas may get one of the nation's first [[high-speed rail]] line.

==Government and politics==

The current [[Texas Constitution]] was adopted in 1876. Like many [[State constitution (United States)|states]], it explicitly provides for a separation of powers. The state's Bill of Rights is much larger than its [[United States Bill of Rights|federal counterpart]], and has provisions unique to Texas.<ref name="BillofRights">{{cite web|title=Bill of Rights (Article 1) |website=Texas Politics |publisher=University of Texas |url=https://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/7_4_2.html |access-date=October 13, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206142915/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/7_4_2.html |archive-date=February 6, 2009 }}</ref>

Texas has a plural [[executive branch]] system limiting the power of the governor, which is a weak executive compared to some other states. Except for the [[Secretary of State of Texas|secretary of state]], voters elect executive officers independently; thus candidates are directly answerable to the public, not the governor.<ref name="pluralexec">{{cite web|year=2005 |title=The Plural Executive |website=Texas Politics |publisher=University of Texas |url=https://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/1_9_0.html |access-date=May 7, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928082847/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/1_9_0.html |archive-date=September 28, 2008 }}</ref> This election system has led to some executive branches split between parties and reduced the ability of the governor to carry out a program. When [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] president [[George W.

The executive branch positions consist of the [[List of Governors of Texas|governor]], [[Lieutenant Governor of Texas|lieutenant governor]], comptroller of public accounts, land commissioner, attorney general, agriculture commissioner, the three-member [[Texas Railroad Commission]], the State Board of Education, and the secretary of state.<ref name="pluralexec" />

The [[bicameral]] [[Texas Legislature]] consists of the [[Texas House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], with 150 members, and a [[Texas Senate|Senate]], with 31 members.

The [[judiciary of Texas]] is one of the most complex in the United States, with many layers and overlapping jurisdictions. Texas has two courts of last resort: the [[Texas Supreme Court]], for civil cases, and the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]]. Except for some municipal benches, partisan elections select judges at all levels of the judiciary; the governor fills vacancies by appointment.<ref name="Judiciary">{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=jzj01|title=Judiciary|first=Paul |last=Womack|date=June 15, 2010}}</ref> Texas is notable for its use of capital punishment, having led the country in executions since capital punishment was reinstated in the ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'' case (see [[Capital punishment in Texas]]).

The [[Texas Ranger Division]] of the [[Texas Department of Public Safety]] is a [[police|law enforcement agency]] with statewide [[jurisdiction]]. Over the years, the Texas Rangers have investigated crimes ranging from murder to political corruption. They have acted as [[riot]] police and as detectives, protected the Texas governor, tracked down fugitives, and functioned as a paramilitary force both for the republic and for the state. The Texas Rangers were unofficially created by [[Stephen F. Austin]] in 1823 and formally constituted in 1835. The Rangers were integral to several important events of Texas history and some of the best-known criminal cases in the history of the [[American Old West|Old West]].<ref name="TexasRangers">{{cite Handbook of Texas|id=met04|title=Texas Rangers|first=Ben H. |last=Procter|orig-year=June 15, 2010 |date=February 8, 2018}}</ref>

The Texas constitution defines the responsibilities of county governments, which serve as agents of the state. What are called commissioners court and court judges are elected to serve as the administrative arm. Most cities in the state, those over 5,000 in population, have [[home-rule]] governments. The vast majority of these have charters for [[council-manager]] forms of government, by which voters elect council members, who hire a professional city manager as an operating officer.

In the 1870s, white Democrats wrested power back in the state legislature from the biracial coalition at the end of Reconstruction. In the early 20th century, the legislature passed bills to impose [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], followed by [[white primaries]]; these measures effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most blacks, poor whites and Mexican Americans.<ref name="yale" /><ref name="texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu" /> In the 1890s, 100,000 blacks voted in the state; by 1906, only 5,000 could vote.<ref name="MOTTU">{{cite book|title=African-American Pioneers of Texas: From the Old West to the New Frontiers (Teacher's Manual) |publisher=Museum of Texas Tech University: Education Division |page=25 |url=https://www.depts.ttu.edu/museumttu/a-a.%20teacher's%20manual.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205173917/http://www.depts.ttu.edu/museumttu/A-A.%20Teacher%27s%20Manual.pdf |archive-date=February 5, 2007 }}</ref> As a result, the Democratic Party dominated [[Politics of Texas|Texas politics]] from the turn of the century, imposing racial segregation and white supremacy. It held power until after passage in the mid-1960s of national civil rights legislation enforcing constitutional rights of all citizens.

Although Texas was essentially a one-party state during this time and the Democratic primary was viewed as "the real election", the Democratic Party had conservative and liberal factions, which became more pronounced after the [[New Deal]].<ref name="PoliticalPartiesTSHA">{{cite Handbook of Texas |title=Political Parties |id=wap02 |date=June 15, 2010}}</ref> Additionally, several factions of the party briefly split during the 1930s and 1940s.<ref name="PoliticalPartiesTSHA" />

Since 1980, most Texas voters have supported Republican presidential candidates. In 2000 and 2004, Republican [[George W.
