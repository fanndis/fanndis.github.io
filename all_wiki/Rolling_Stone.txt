'''''Rolling Stone''''' is an American monthly magazine that focuses on [[popular culture]]. It was founded in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], in 1967 by [[Jann Wenner]], and the music critic [[Ralph J. Gleason]]. It was first known for its coverage of [[rock music]] and for political reporting by [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. In the 1990s, the magazine broadened and shifted its focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music.<ref name="samuelfreedman.com"/> It has since returned to its traditional mix of content, including music, entertainment, and politics.

The first magazine was released in 1967 and featured [[John Lennon]] on the cover and was published every two weeks. It is known for provocative photography and its cover photos, featuring musicians, politicians, athletes, and actors. In addition to its print version in the United States, it publishes content through Rollingstone.com and numerous international editions.

[[Penske Media Corporation]] is the current owner of ''Rolling Stone'', purchasing 51 percent of the magazine in 2017 and the remaining 49 percent in 2019.

==History==

In the first issue,<ref>{{cite web|title=Rolling Stone 1967 Magazine Archives {{!}} Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/coverwall/1967|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Wenner explained that the title of the magazine referred to the 1950 blues song "[[Rollin' Stone]]", recorded by [[Muddy Waters]], and [[Bob Dylan]]'s 1965 hit single "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]": In a 2017 article celebrating the publication's 50th anniversary, ''Rolling Stone''<nowiki/>'s [[David Browne (journalist)|David Browne]] stated that the magazine's name was a nod to [[the Rolling Stones]] in an addition to "Rollin' Stone" and "Like a Rolling Stone".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Browne|first=David|date=2017-09-08|title=50th Anniversary Flashback: The Rolling Stones in Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/50th-anniversary-flashback-the-rolling-stones-in-rolling-stone-255924/|access-date=2020-09-30|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>

{{Quote|text=You're probably wondering what we're trying to do. It's hard to say: sort of a magazine and sort of a newspaper. The name of it is ''Rolling Stone'' which comes from an old saying, "A rolling stone gathers no moss."

Muddy Waters used the name for a song he wrote. The Rolling Stones took their name from Muddy's song. "Like a Rolling Stone" was the title of Bob Dylan's first rock and roll record. We have begun a new publication reflecting what we see are the changes in rock and roll and the changes related to rock and roll."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Jann|last=Wenner|author-link=Jann Wenner|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=November 9, 1967|page=2|title=A Letter from the Editor}}</ref><ref name="Deep">{{Cite book  | last = Palmer  | first = Robert  | title = Deep Blues  | publisher = Penguin Books  | year = 1981  | page = [https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/104 104]  | url = https://archive.org/details/deepblues00palm/page/104  | isbn = 0-14-006223-8  | url-access = registration  }}</ref>}} Some authors have attributed the name solely to Dylan's hit single: "At [Ralph] Gleason's suggestion, Wenner named his magazine after a Bob Dylan song."<ref>Richardson, Peter (2009).

However, it distanced itself from the underground newspapers of the time, such as ''[[Berkeley Barb]]'', embracing more traditional journalistic standards and avoiding the radical politics of the [[underground press]]. In the first edition, Wenner wrote that ''Rolling Stone'' "is not just about the music, but about the things and attitudes that music embraces".<ref name="HMI">{{cite book |last1=MacDonald |first1=Raymond A.R. |last2=Hargreaves |first2=David John |last3=Miell |first3=Dorothy |title=Handbook of Musical Identities |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199679485 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=COIWDgAAQBAJ&q=%22%22is+not+just+about+the+music%2C+but+about+the+things+and+attitudes+that+music+embraces%22%22&pg=PA288 |access-date=15 August 2019}}</ref>

The magazine's long-running slogan, "All the news that fits", was provided by early contributor, manager and sometime editor [[Susan Lydon]].

In the 1970s, ''Rolling Stone'' began to make a mark with its political coverage, with the likes of [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]] journalist [[Hunter S. Thompson]] writing for the magazine's political section. Thompson first published his most famous work ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' within the pages of ''Rolling Stone'', where he remained a contributing editor until his death in 2005.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/06/fear-rolling-stone-hunter-thompson|title=Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone: The Essential Writing of Hunter S Thompson – review|last=East|first=Ben|date=January 5, 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=May 31, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602115226/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/06/fear-rolling-stone-hunter-thompson|archive-date=June 2, 2017}}</ref> In the 1970s, the magazine also helped launch the careers of many prominent authors, including [[Cameron Crowe]], [[Lester Bangs]], [[Joe Klein (journalist)|Joe Klein]], [[Joe Eszterhas]], [[Ben Fong-Torres]], [[Patti Smith]] and [[P. J. O'Rourke]]. It was at this point that the magazine ran some of its most famous stories. The January 21, 1970 issue covered the [[Altamont Free Concert]] and the [[death of Meredith Hunter]] which won a [[National Magazine Awards#Specialized Journalism|Specialized Journalism]] award at the [[National Magazine Awards]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Rolling Stone|title=Rolling Stone at 50: Shaping Contrasting Narratives of Woodstock, Altamont|date=February 7, 2017|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/rolling-stone-at-50-shaping-contrasting-narratives-of-woodstock-altamont-196583/|last=Browne|first=David|access-date=July 8, 2020}}</ref> Later in 1970, ''Rolling Stone'' published a 30,000 word feature on [[Charles Manson]] by [[David Dalton (writer)|David Dalton]] and David Felton, including their interview of Manson when he was in the [[LA County Jail]] awaiting trial, which won ''Rolling Stone'' its first National Magazine Award.<ref name=scoops>{{cite newspaper|title=The Early Scoops|work=Rolling Stones 50 Years|pages=8–9}}</ref> Four years later, they also covered the [[Patty Hearst]] abduction odyssey.

In 1972, Wenner assigned [[Tom Wolfe]] to cover the launch of [[NASA]]'s last Moon mission, [[Apollo 17]]. He published a four-part series in 1973 titled "Post-Orbital Remorse", about the depression that some astronauts experienced after having been in space. After the series, Wolfe began researching the whole of the space program, in what became a seven-year project from which he took time to write ''[[The Painted Word]]'', a book on art, and to complete ''[[Mauve Gloves & Madmen, Clutter & Vine]]'', a collection of shorter pieces<ref>Ragen 2001, pp. 22–26.</ref> and eventually ''[[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]]''.

''Rolling Stone'' recruited writers from smaller music magazines, including [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]] from ''[[Sing Out!]]'', who became record reviews editor from 1978 to 1983, and [[Dave Marsh]] from ''[[Creem]]''.<ref name=writers>{{cite newspaper|title=The Writers|work=Rolling Stones 50 Years|pages=10–13}}</ref>

In 1977, the magazine moved its headquarters from San Francisco to New York City. Editor Jann Wenner said San Francisco had become "a cultural backwater".<ref>Temple, Charles (April 18, 2009) [http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Rolling-Stone-closes-last-S-F-office-3164870.php "Rolling Stone closes last S.F. office".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814034224/http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Rolling-Stone-closes-last-S-F-office-3164870.php |date=August 14, 2014 }}.

===1980 to 1999: Change to entertainment magazine===
[[Kurt Loder]] joined ''Rolling Stone'' in May 1979 and spent 9 years there, including as editor. [[Timothy White (writer)|Timothy White]] joined as a writer from ''[[Crawdaddy (magazine)|Crawdaddy]]'' and [[David Fricke]] from ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]''.<ref name=writers/> Tom Wolfe wrote to Wenner to propose an idea drawn from [[Charles Dickens]] and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]: to serialize a novel. Wenner offered Wolfe around $200,000 to serialize his work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ragen | 2002 |pp= 31}}</ref> The frequent deadline pressure gave Wolfe the motivation he had sought, and from July 1984 to August 1985, he published a new installment in each biweekly issue of ''Rolling Stone''. Later Wolfe was unhappy with his "very public first draft"<ref>{{Harvnb|Ragen|2002|pp=32}}</ref> and thoroughly revised his work, even changing his protagonist, Sherman McCoy, and published it as ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' in 1987.

''Rolling Stone'' was known for its musical coverage and for Thompson's political reporting and in 1985, they hired an advertising agency to refocus its image under the series "Perception/Reality" comparing Sixties symbols to those of the Eighties, which led to an increase in advertising revenue and pages.<ref>{{cite newspaper|title=Perception/Reality|work=Rolling Stones 50 Years|pages=14–15}}</ref> It also shifted to more of an entertainment magazine in the 1980s. It still had music as the main topic but began to increase its coverage of celebrities, films, and pop culture. It also began releasing its annual "Hot Issue."<ref name="IndianUniversity">{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Sammye |last2=Prijatel |first2=Patricia |title=The Magazine from Cover to Cover: Inside a Dynamic Industry |date=1999 |publisher=Indiana University |isbn=9780658002298 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_nyAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Rolling+Stone%22+annual+hot+issue+1980s |access-date=15 August 2019}}</ref> In the 1990s, the magazine changed its format to appeal to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. This led to criticism that the magazine was emphasizing style over substance.<ref name="samuelfreedman.com"/>

===2000 to 2015: Expansion of readership===
[[File:RS 500 Front Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Rolling Stone cover from 2004.]]
After years of declining readership, the magazine experienced a major resurgence of interest and relevance with the work of two young journalists in the late 2000s, [[Michael Hastings (journalist)|Michael Hastings]] and [[Matt Taibbi]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} [[Rob Sheffield]] also joined from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''.<ref name=writers/>

In 2005, [[Dana Leslie Fields]], former publisher of ''Rolling Stone'', who had worked at the magazine for 17 years, was an inaugural inductee into the Magazine Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lamusicawards.com/act/rolling-stone-magazine/|title=Rolling Stone Magazine|website=LA Music Awards|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701232339/http://www.lamusicawards.com/act/rolling-stone-magazine/|archive-date=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

In 2009, Taibbi unleashed an acclaimed series of scathing reports on the financial meltdown of the time. He famously described [[Goldman Sachs]] as "a great [[vampire squid]]".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Zamansky |first1=Jake |title=The Great Vampire Squid Keeps On Sucking |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jakezamansky/2013/08/08/the-great-vampire-squid-keeps-on-sucking/#6e61a8bc7df8 |access-date=15 August 2019 |magazine=Forbes |date=8 August 2013}}</ref>

Bigger headlines came at the end of June 2010.

In 2010, Taibbi documented illegal and fraudulent actions by banks in the foreclosure courts, after traveling to Jacksonville, Florida and sitting in on hearings in the courtroom.

===Print format===
The printed format has gone through several changes. The first publications, in 1967–72, were in folded [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspaper format]], with no staples, black ink text, and a single color highlight that changed each edition. From 1973 onwards, editions were produced on a four-color press with a different newsprint paper size. In 1979, the bar code appeared. In 1980, it became a gloss-paper, large format (10"×12") magazine. Editions switched to the standard 8"×11" magazine size starting with the issue dated October 30, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rolling Stone ends large format after 4 decades|first=Anick|last=Jesdanun|agency=Associated Press|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2008-10-14-rollingstone_N.htm|work=USA Today}}</ref> Starting with the new monthly July 2018 issue, it returned to the previous 10"×12" large format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/cardi-b-live-events-fewer-issues-meet-the-new-rolling-stone-1530529320|title=Cardi B, Live Events, Fewer Issues: Meet the New Rolling Stone|last=Trachtenberg|first=Jeffrey A.|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref>

==Website==
''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s maintains a website where it shares similar content to its print publication.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

The site at one time had an extensive message-board forum. By the late 1990s, this had developed into a thriving community, with many regular members and contributors worldwide. However, the site was also plagued with numerous [[Troll (Internet)|Internet trolls]] and malicious code-hackers, who vandalized the forum substantially.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rsjunior.proboards18.com/index.cgi?board=tribunal&action=display&thread=1085021884&page=19 |title=RS.com Castaways – Troll Tribunal |publisher=Rsjunior.proboards18.com |access-date=August 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211232740/http://rsjunior.proboards18.com/index.cgi?board=tribunal&action=display&thread=1085021884&page=19 |archive-date=February 11, 2008 }}</ref> The magazine abruptly deleted the forum in May 2004, then began a new, much more limited message board community on their site in late 2005, only to remove it again in 2006. In March 2008, the website started a new message board section once again, then deleted it in April 2010.

''Rolling Stone'' devotes one of its table of contents pages to promoting material currently appearing on its website, listing detailed links to the items.

On April 19, 2010, the website underwent a redesign and began featuring the complete archives of ''Rolling Stone''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.rollingstone.com |title=Rolling Stone All Access |publisher=Archive.rollingstone.com |access-date=June 20, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617152701/http://archive.rollingstone.com/ |archive-date=June 17, 2012  }}</ref> The archive was first launched under a for-pay model, but has since transitioned to a free-with-print-subscription model.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sub.rollingstone.com/allaccess/subscribe |title=Rolling Stone All Access-Subscribe to Rolling Stone |publisher=Sub.rollingstone.com |access-date=June 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105164155/https://sub.rollingstone.com/allaccess/subscribe |archive-date=November 5, 2012  }}</ref> In the spring of 2012, ''Rolling Stone'' launched a [[federated search]] feature which searches both the website and the archive.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/search?q=wiki |title=Federated Rolling Stone search for 'wiki' |magazine=Rollingstone.com |access-date=June 20, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924225136/http://www.rollingstone.com/search?q=wiki |archive-date=September 24, 2015  }}</ref>

The website has become an interactive source of biographical information on music artists in addition to historical rankings from the magazine. Users can cross-reference lists and they are also provided with historical insights.  For example, one group that is listed on both [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]] and [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] is [[Toots and the Maytals]], with biographical details from Rolling Stone that explain how [[Toots and the Maytals]] are responsible for coining the term "[[reggae]]" in their song "[[Do the Reggay]]".<ref>Rolling Stone.

===''Glixel''===
{{anchor|Glixel}}
In May 2016, Wenner Media announced plans to create a separate online publication dedicated to the coverage of video games and video game culture. Gus Wenner, Jann Wenner's son and head of digital for the publication at the time, told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "gaming is today what rock 'n' roll was when ''Rolling Stone'' was founded". ''Glixel'' was originally hosted on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s website and transitioned to its own domain by October 2016. Stories from ''Glixel'' are included on the ''Rolling Stone'' website, while writers for ''Rolling Stone'' were also able to contribute to ''Glixel''. The site was headed by John Davison, and its offices were located in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/23/business/wenner-media-to-launch-glixel-website-as-lifeline-for-gamers.html | title = Wenner Media to Launch Glixel Website as Lifeline for Gamers | first = Sydney | last = Ember | date = May 22, 2016 | access-date = December 16, 2016 | work = [[The New York Times]] | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170524225143/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/23/business/wenner-media-to-launch-glixel-website-as-lifeline-for-gamers.html | archive-date = May 24, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.adweek.com/fishbowlny/wenner-media-to-launch-gaming-site-glixel/376116 | title = Wenner Media to Launch Gaming Site 'Glixel' | first = Chris | last = O'Shea | date = May 23, 2016 | access-date = December 16, 2016 | work = [[Adweek]] | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161222080216/http://www.adweek.com/fishbowlny/wenner-media-to-launch-gaming-site-glixel/376116 | archive-date = December 22, 2016 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' closed down the offices in June 2017 and fired the entire staff, citing the difficulties of working with the remote site from their main New York office.

==Criticism==
One major criticism of ''Rolling Stone'' involves its generational bias toward the 1960s and 1970s. One critic referred to the ''Rolling Stone'' list of the "500 Greatest Songs" as an example of "unrepentant [[rockist]] fogeyism".<ref name="Popism"/> In further response to this issue, rock critic [[Jim DeRogatis]], a former ''Rolling Stone'' editor, published a thorough critique of the magazine's lists in a book called ''Kill Your Idols: A New Generation of Rock Writers Reconsiders the Classics'', which featured differing opinions from many younger critics.<ref>July 4, 2004. Idle worship, or revisiting the classics. Jim DeRogatis. ''Chicago Sun-Times''.

''Rolling Stone'' magazine has been criticized for reconsidering many classic albums that it had previously dismissed, and for frequent use of the 3.5-star rating. For example, [[Led Zeppelin]] was largely written off by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine critics during the band's most active years in the 1970s, but by 2006, a [[Article (publishing)|cover story]] on the band honored them as "the Heaviest Band of All Time".<ref name="shout">{{cite web|url=http://www.shoutmouth.com/index.php/news/12829 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630190730/http://www.shoutmouth.com/index.php/news/12829 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 30, 2007 |title=Documentation of attempt to change reviews |publisher=Shoutmouth.com |access-date=August 18, 2011 }}</ref> A critic for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine described a conference at which 1984's ''[[The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'' was scrutinized. As he described it, "The guide virtually ignored hip-hop and ruthlessly panned heavy metal, the two genres that within a few years would dominate the pop charts. In an auditorium packed with music journalists, you could detect more than a few anxious titters: How many of us will want our record reviews read back to us 20 years hence?"<ref name="Popism">{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Jody |url=http://slate.com/id/2141418/ |title=Does hating rock make you a music critic? |website=Slate |date=May 9, 2006 |access-date=August 18, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826062339/http://www.slate.com/id/2141418 |archive-date=August 26, 2011  }}</ref>

The hiring of former ''[[FHM]]'' editor Ed Needham further enraged critics who alleged that ''Rolling Stone'' had lost its credibility.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://salon.com/ent/feature/2002/06/28/rollingstone/index.html |title=The death of Rolling Stone |work=Salon.com |date=June 28, 2002 |access-date=August 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220000302/http://salon.com/ent/feature/2002/06/28/rollingstone/index.html |archive-date=December 20, 2009  }}</ref>

The 2003 "Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Guitarists of all Time" article, which named only two female musicians, resulted in ''[[Venus Zine]]'' answering with their own list, entitled "The Greatest Female Guitarists of All Time".<ref name="The Greatest Female Guitarists of All Time">{{cite web|url=http://www.venuszine.com/articles/music/2575/The_Greatest_Female_Guitarists_of_All_Time|title=The Greatest Female Guitarists of All Time|last=Thurston|first=Bonnie|date=March 1, 2008|website=Venus Zine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917153555/http://www.venuszine.com/articles/music/2575/The_Greatest_Female_Guitarists_of_All_Time|archive-date=September 17, 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=October 15, 2010}}</ref>

The August 2013 ''Rolling Stone'' cover, featuring then-accused (later convicted) [[Boston Marathon bombing|Boston Marathon]] bomber [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev]], drew widespread criticism that the magazine was "glamorizing terrorism" and that the cover was a "slap in the face to the great city of Boston".<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57594141/rolling-stone-cover-featuring-boston-marathon-bombing-suspect-stirs-online-backlash/|title = Rolling Stone cover featuring Boston Marathon bombing suspect stirs online backlash|date = July 17, 2013|publisher = CBS.com|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130717163158/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57594141/rolling-stone-cover-featuring-boston-marathon-bombing-suspect-stirs-online-backlash/|archive-date = July 17, 2013|df = mdy-all}}</ref> The online edition of the article was accompanied by a short editorial stating that the story "falls within the traditions of journalism and ''Rolling Stone'''s long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day".<ref name=reitman>{{cite web|last=Reitman|first=Janet|title=Jahar's World|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/jahars-world-20130717|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=July 24, 2013|date=July 17, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726050713/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/jahars-world-20130717|archive-date=July 26, 2013}}</ref> The controversial cover photograph that was used by ''Rolling Stone'' had previously featured on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' on May 5, 2013.<ref name=wemple>{{cite news|last=Wemple|first=Erik|title=Rolling Stone's Tsarnaev: Did the New York Times face a backlash?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/07/17/rolling-stones-tsarnaev-did-the-new-york-times-face-a-backlash/|work=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=July 24, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722091511/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2013/07/17/rolling-stones-tsarnaev-did-the-new-york-times-face-a-backlash/|archive-date=July 22, 2013}}</ref>

Boston mayor [[Thomas Menino]] sent a letter to ''Rolling Stone'' publisher [[Jann Wenner]], calling the cover "ill-conceived, at best ... [it] reaffirms a message that destruction gains fame for killers and their 'causes'."  Menino also wrote, "To respond to you in anger is to feed into your obvious market strategy", and that Wenner could have written about the survivors or the people who came to help after the bombings instead. In conclusion he wrote, "The survivors of the Boston Marathon deserve ''Rolling Stone'' cover stories, though I no longer feel that ''Rolling Stone ''deserves them."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=513983038667049&set=a.513799432018743.1073741828.513576305374389&type=1&theater |title=Tijdlijnfoto's |publisher=Facebook |access-date=July 18, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101113330/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=513983038667049&set=a.513799432018743.1073741828.513576305374389&type=1&theater |archive-date=January 1, 2016  }}</ref>

Said the filing, "''Rolling Stone'' and Erdely's highly defamatory and false statements about Dean Eramo were not the result of an innocent mistake.  They were the result of a wanton journalist who was more concerned with writing an article that fulfilled her preconceived narrative about the victimization of women on American college campuses, and a malicious publisher who was more concerned about selling magazines to boost the economic bottom line for its faltering magazine, than they were about discovering the truth or actual facts."<ref>Shapiro, T.

[[George Harrison]]'s song "[[This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)|This Guitar]]" (1975), a lyrical sequel to his [[Beatles]] track "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]" (1968), references the magazine in its second verse: "Learned to get up when I fall / Can even climb'' Rolling Stone ''walls". The song was written in response to some highly unfavorable reviews from ''Rolling Stone'' and other publications for Harrison's 1974 North American tour and the ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]'' album.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leng, Simon |title=While My Guitar Gently Weeps: The Music of George Harrison|publisher= Hal Leonard |location=Milwaukee, WI|date=2006|pages= 181–82}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Clayson, Alan|title=George Harrison|publisher= Sanctuary |location=London|date= 2003|page= 350|isbn =9781860743498}}</ref>

The 2000 film ''[[Almost Famous]]'' centers on a teenage journalist writing for the magazine in the early 1970s while covering the fictional band Stillwater. The film was directed by [[Cameron Crowe]] and based on his own experiences as a young journalist for the magazine in the same time period.<ref>[http://www.theuncool.com/bio/ "Biography,"] The Uncool: The Official Website for Everything Cameron Crowe. Accessed December 14, 2014.</ref>

"[[The Cover of Rolling Stone]]" is a song written by [[Shel Silverstein]] and first recorded by American rock group [[Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show]]. The song satirizes success in the music business; the song's narrator laments that his band, despite having the superficial attributes of a successful rock star (including drug usage, "teenage groupies, who'll do anything we say", and a frenetic guitar solo), has been unable to "get their pictures on the cover of the ''Rolling Stone''".
