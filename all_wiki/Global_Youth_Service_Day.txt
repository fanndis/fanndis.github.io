Speaking about Global Youth Service Day, [[Jane Goodall]] commented, "I have often said that every individual counts, every individual has a role to play, and every individual makes a difference. Global Youth Service Day proves it." [[Kofi Annan]] said that, "Volunteers are some of our most valued partners, and Global Youth Service Day celebrates the efforts of the youngest of them."<ref>[http://www.gysd.org/press/ Press Room], Global Youth Service Day.
