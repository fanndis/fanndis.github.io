'''Lund University''' ({{lang-sv|Lunds universitet}}) is a prestigious university in Sweden and one of northern Europe’s oldest universities. The university is located in the city of [[Lund]] in the province of [[Scania]], [[Sweden]]. It arguably traces its roots back to 1425, when a [[Franciscan]] [[studium generale]] was founded in Lund. After Sweden won Scania from [[Denmark]] in the 1658 [[Treaty of Roskilde]], the university was officially founded in 1666 on the location of the old [[studium generale]] next to [[Lund Cathedral]].

Lund University has nine [[Faculty (division)|faculties]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/about/management-leadership|title=Management and leadership|access-date=5 July 2016}}</ref> with additional campuses in the cities of [[Malmö]] and [[Helsingborg]], with 40,000 students<ref name="lunduniversity.lu.se"/> in 270 different programmes and 1,300 freestanding courses. The university has some 600 partner universities in nearly 70 countries and it belongs to the [[League of European Research Universities]] as well as the global [[Universitas 21]] network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/about/about-lund-university |title=About Lund University - Lund University |publisher=Lund University |date=2016-07-05 |access-date=2016-07-05}}</ref> Lund University is consistently ranked among the world's top 100 universities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/about/about-lund-university/university-world-rankings|title=University world rankings - LUND UNIVERSITY – A TOP 100 UNIVERSITY|access-date=21 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2015|title=QS World University Rankings - 2015|work=Top Universities|access-date=31 May 2015}}</ref><ref>[[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]'s [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2016 |title=The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2016 |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |access-date=2016-07-05}}</ref>

Two major facilities for materials research are in Lund University: [[MAX IV]], a synchrotron radiation laboratory – inaugurated in June 2016, and [[European Spallation Source]] (ESS), a new European facility that will provide up to 100 times brighter neutron beams than existing facilities today, to be opened in 2023.<ref>[https://europeanspallationsource.se/ess-mandate ESS Mandate] Retrieved 21 May 2017.</ref>

The university centers on the [[Lundagård (park)|Lundagård]] park adjacent to the [[Lund Cathedral]], with various departments spread in different locations in town, but mostly concentrated in a belt stretching north from the park connecting to the university hospital area and continuing out to the northeastern periphery of the town, where one finds the large campus of the [[Lund Institute of Technology|Faculty of Engineering]].

The university has always been on the radar of Indian and Pakistani trolls who often spam the university's Facebook page because of its name. In mid 2020, the University acknowledged that and warned trolls to keep up the jokes to themselves and their friends.

== History ==
[[File:Lunds universitets huvudbyggnad (juli 2008).jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Lund University main building]], built in 1882, drawn by [[Helgo Zettervall]].]]

=== Medieval origins ===
The city of [[Lund]] has a long history as a center for learning and was the ecclesiastical centre and seat of the archbishop of [[Denmark]]. A [[cathedral school]] (the ''[[Katedralskolan, Lund|Katedralskolan]]'') for the training of [[clergy]] was established in 1085 and is today Scandinavia's [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest school]].

The university traces its roots back to 1425, when a [[Franciscan]] ''[[studium generale]]'' (a [[medieval university]]) was founded in Lund next to the [[Lund Cathedral]] (with baccalaureate degree started in 1438), making it the oldest institution of higher education in Scandinavia followed by [[studium generale|studia generalia]] in [[Uppsala]] in 1477 and [[Copenhagen]] in 1479. After Sweden won Scania from Denmark in the 1658 [[Treaty of Roskilde]], the university was founded in 1666 on the location of the old [[studium generale]] next to [[Lund Cathedral]].<ref name="A Brief History of Lund University">[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/about/about-lund-university/a-brief-history A Brief History of Lund University]</ref> The studium generale had not survived the Lutheran Reformation of 1536, which is why the university is considered a separate institution when founded in 1666.

=== 17th–19th centuries ===
After the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658, the [[Scanian lands]] came under the possession of the Swedish Crown, which founded the University in 1666 as a means of making Scania Swedish by educating teachers in Swedish, and to culturally integrate the Scania region with Sweden. The university was named ''Academia Carolina'' after [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] until the late 19th century when Lund University became the widespread denomination. It was the fifth university under the Swedish king, after [[Uppsala University]] (1477), the [[University of Tartu]] (1632, now in [[Estonia]]), the [[Academy of Åbo]] (1640, now in [[Finland]]), and the [[University of Greifswald]] (founded 1456; Swedish 1648–1815, now in [[Germany]]).

The university was at its founding granted four faculties: [[faculty of law|Law]], [[Theological]], [[Medicine]] and [[Philosophy]]. They were the cornerstones, and for more than 200 years this system was in effect. Towards the end of the 17th century, the number of students hovered around 100. Some notable professors in the early days were [[Samuel Pufendorf]], a juridical historian; and [[Canutus Hahn]] and [[Kristian Papke]] in philosophy.

The [[Scanian War]] in 1676 led to a shut-down, which lasted until 1682. The university was re-opened largely due to regional patriots, but the university was not to enjoy a high status until well into the 19th century. Lecturing rooms were few, and lectures were held in the [[Lund Cathedral]] and its adjacent chapel. The professors were underpaid.

[[File:Historiska museet i Lund, 1800-tal.jpg|250px|thumb|right|View of the Historical Museum building in the 19th century.]]
In 1716, [[Charles XII of Sweden]] entered Lund. He stayed in Lund for two years, in between his warlike expeditions. Lund and the university attracted a temporary attention boost. The most notable lecturer during this time was [[Andreas Rydelius]].

Peace was finally restored with the death of Charles XII in 1718, and during the first half of the 18th century the university was granted added funds. The number of students was now well around 500. Despite not being on par with [[Uppsala University]], it had still built a solid reputation and managed to attract prominent professors.

Around 1760 the university reputation dropped as the number of students fell below 200, most of whom hailed from around the province. However, by 1780 its reputation was largely restored, and continued to rise through the 1820s. This was largely owing to popular and well-educated lecturers particularly in philology; the prominent professor [[Esaias Tegnér]] was a particularly notable character with widespread authority. He, in turn, attracted others towards Lund. One of these was the young theological student [[C. G. Brunius]], who studied ancient languages under Tegnér and were later to become professor of Greek. With time he was to devote himself to architectures and he redesigned several of Lund's buildings, as well as churches of the province.

In 1845 and 1862 Lund co-hosted [[Nordic student meeting]]s together with the [[University of Copenhagen]].

A student called [[Elsa Collin]] was the first woman in the whole of Sweden to take part in a [[Spex (theatre)|spex]].

=== 20th century – present ===
[[File:Universitetsplatsen Lund.jpg|thumb|right|The University Square in the 1910s.]]
In the early 20th century, the university had a student population as small as one thousand, consisting largely of upper-class pupils training to become civil servants, lawyers and doctors. In the coming decades it started to grow significantly until it became one of the country's largest. In 1964 the social sciences were split from the Faculty of Humanities. [[Lund Institute of Technology]] was established in 1961 but was merged with Lund University eight years later.

In recent years, Lund University has been very popular among applicants to Swedish higher education institutions, both nationally<ref>[http://www.scb.se/statistik/_publikationer/UF0513_2009A01_BR_A40BR1002.pdf Utbildning Gymnasieungdomars studieintresse läsåret 2009/2010]</ref> and internationally.<ref name="popularformasters">{{cite web|url=http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/o.o.i.s?id=24890&news_item=5781|title=Home - Lund University|access-date=31 May 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105044724/http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/o.o.i.s?id=24890&news_item=5781|archive-date=5 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sweden.se/study/2011/02/03/decrease-in-international-applicants-to-swedish-universities/|title=Decrease in international applicants to Swedish universities|access-date=31 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124150445/http://blogs.sweden.se/study/2011/02/03/decrease-in-international-applicants-to-swedish-universities/|archive-date=24 January 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> For studies starting in autumn 2012, Lund received 11,160 foreign master's applications from 152 countries, which was roughly one third of all international applications to Swedish universities.<ref name="popularformasters" />

===Women at the university===
The first woman to study in Lund was [[Hildegard Björck]] (spring of 1880) who had previously studied in [[Uppsala]] and had there been the first Swedish woman ever to get an academic degree. Her tenure in Lund was however very brief and the medical student [[Hedda Andersson]] who entered the university later in 1880 (two years before the next woman to do so) is usually mentioned as the first woman at Lund University.<ref name=Andersson>[http://www.med.lu.se/plain/english/about_the_faculty/history_of_the_faculty/personalities_discoveries_and_innovations/hedda_andersson Lund University Medical Faculty] Hedda Andersson (1861-1950)</ref> Hilma Borelius was the first woman who finished a doctorate in Lund, in 1910. The first woman to be appointed to a professor's chair was the historian [[Birgitta Odén]] (1965). In 1992 [[Boel Flodgren]], Professor of Business Law, was appointed [[rector magnificus]] (or, strictly speaking, ''rectrix magnifica'') of Lund University. As such, she was the first woman to be the head of a European university.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Campus===
[[File:Kungshuset Lund 2010.jpg|thumb|''[[Kungshuset]],'' the oldest university building (completed 1584).]]
[[Image:Universitetsbiblioteket 080508.jpg|thumb|University Central Library]]
[[File:Skånes universitetssjukhus i Lund–flygbild 06 september 2014.jpg|thumb|University Hospital]]
The university's facilities are mainly located in the small city of Lund in Scania, about 15&nbsp;km away from central [[Malmö]] and 50&nbsp;km from [[Copenhagen]]. The large student- and staff population makes an impact on the city, effectively making it a [[college town|university town]]. Over a hundred university buildings<ref name="map">[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/images/maps/2010campusmap.pdf - Campus map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815061601/http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/images/maps/2010campusmap.pdf |date=2011-08-15 }}</ref> scatter around town, most of them in an area covering more than 1&nbsp;km², stretching towards the north-east from Lundagård park in the very centre of town. Buildings in and around Lundagård include the main building, [[Kungshuset]], the Historical Museum and the Academic Society's headquarters. The main library building is located in a park 400 meters to the north, followed by the large hospital complex.

Lund University has a satellite campus in nearby [[Malmö]], Sweden's third-largest city. The Faculty of Fine and Performing Arts' three academies: [[Malmö Art Academy]], [[Malmö Academy of Music]] and [[Malmö Theatre Academy]], are all located in Malmö. The city is also the location of Skåne University Hospital, where Lund University performs a considerable amount of research and medical training.

[[Campus Helsingborg]] is, as the name suggests, located in the city of [[Helsingborg]], almost 50&nbsp;km from Lund. Opened in 2000, it consists of a building in the city centre, right next to the central train station and the harbour. Nearly 3,000 students are based on the campus.<ref>[http://www.ch.lu.se/index.php?id=235 Campus Helsingborg - about] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718165932/http://www.ch.lu.se/index.php?id=235 |date=2011-07-18 }}</ref> The Department of Service Management and the Department of Communication and Media are among those located at the campus in Helsingborg.

Teaching and training at the School of Aviation (LUSA) takes place at an airfield next to the town of [[Ljungbyhed]], about 40&nbsp;km away from Lund.

=== Library ===
[[Lund University library]] was established in 1668 at the same time as the university and is one of Sweden's oldest and largest libraries. Since 1698 it has received [[legal deposit]] copies of everything printed in the country. Today six Swedish libraries receive legal deposit copies, but only Lund and the [[National Library of Sweden|Royal Library]] in [[Stockholm]] are required to keep everything for posterity. Swedish imprints make up half of the collections, which amount to 170,000 linear metres of shelving (2006). The library serves 620,000 loans per year, the staff is 200 full-time equivalents, and the 33 branch libraries house 2600 reading room desks.<ref>Lund University library website, statistics for 2006, {{cite web |url=http://www.lub.lu.se/om-lub/organisation/lub-i-siffror-2006.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-01-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329114849/http://www.lub.lu.se/om-lub/organisation/lub-i-siffror-2006.html |archive-date=2008-03-29 }}</ref>
The current main building at Helgonabacken opened in 1907. Before that, the old building was ''[[Liberiet]]'' close to the city's cathedral. Liberiet was built as a library in the 15th century but now serves as a cafe.

=== Hospital ===
Education and research in the [[health sciences]] at the university is operated in cooperation with [[Skåne University Hospital]], located in both Lund and Malmö. Medical education takes place in the Biomedical Centre, next to the hospital in Lund. [[Nursing]] and [[occupational therapy]] are taught in the Health Sciences Centre nearby. The university also operates the Clinical Research Centre in Malmö, featuring many specialized laboratories. There are over 100 faculty.

=== Accommodation ===

===Education===
Approximately 42,000 students study within one of the 276 educational programs, the 100 international master's programmes or the 2,200 independent courses. Around five hundred courses are, or can be, held in English for the benefit of international exchange students. There are several programmes allowing foreign students to study abroad at the University. Notable exchangees include United States Supreme Court Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], who spent time at Lund University in the 1960s conducting research.<ref>Linda, Bayer "Ruth Bader Ginsburg" (Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2000), 46.</ref> The university offers 9 out of the 20 most sought after programmes in Sweden. The master's programme in [[International Marketing]] is the most popular choice in the country, with almost a thousand applications yearly.

Students are awarded [[ECTS credits]] for all completed courses. Grading scales vary by programme and even course; "Pass/Fail" and "Pass with distinction/Pass/Fail" are most common, but [[ECTS grades]] are increasingly given as well. Engineering students generally receive grades as "5/4/3/Fail".

== Student life ==
[[Image:AF-borgen 2002.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[AF-borgen]],'' the student-run complex at the heart of student life in Lund, May 2002.]]
Lund student life is based on three central structures: the student nations, the Academic Society (AF) and the student unions. Before July 1, 2010, students were required to enroll in a student union, nation and AF in order to receive grades at the university, but this is no longer compulsory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/11770/a/122528 |title=Frihet och inflytande - kårobligatoriets avskaffande |publisher=Regeringen.se |access-date=2012-04-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110612212853/http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/11770/a/122528 |archive-date=2011-06-12 }}</ref> Students may still enroll in these organizations if they wish.

=== Student nations ===
{{main|List of Lund University nations}}
The [[nations at Swedish universities|nations]] in Lund are a central part of the university's history, initially serving as [[residential college]]s for students, organized by geographic origin. [[Östgöta Nation, Lund|Östgöta Nation]], the oldest nation, was established in 1668, two years after the university was founded. While the nations still offer limited housing, today they are best described as [[student society|student societies]].

Today students may enroll in any nation, although the nations still preserve their geographic names. In most cases it does not matter what nation one enrolls in, but different nations offer different activities for interested students.

Each nation has student housing, but the accommodations in no way meet demand, and they are usually appointed according to a queue system. Each nation has at least one pub evening per week, with a following night club. The solemn peak event in the course of an activity year is the organization of student balls once a year. Most well known of the nation balls (as opposed to balls organized by student unions) is the ball hosted by Göteborgs Nation - called the "Gustaf II Adolf Ball" (also known as the "GA-Ball"). Most nations also host at least one [[banquet]] per week, where a three-course dinner is served. Each nation also has different activities for students interested in sports, arts, or partying. All activities within the nations are voluntary.

=== The Academic Society ===
In 1830, Professor [[Carl Adolph Agardh]] formed ''Akademiska Föreningen'' (The Academic Society), commonly referred to as AF, with the goal of "developing and cultivating the academic life" by bringing students and faculty from all departments and student nations together in one organization. [[Oscar I of Sweden|Prince Oscar]], then Sweden's Chancellor of Education, donated 2000 Kronor to help found the society. In 1848, construction began on ''[[AF-borgen]]'' (the AF Fortress), which is located opposite the [[Lund University main building|Main Building]] in [[Lundagård (park)|Lundagård]]. To this day, AF is the center of student life in Lund, featuring many theater companies, a prize-winning student radio ([[Radio AF]]), and organizing the enormous ''Lundakarnevalen'' (the Lund Carnival) every four years. "AF Bostäder", an independent foundation with close ties to Akademiska Föreningen, maintains over 5,700 student residences in Lund.<ref>[http://www.afbostader.se/en/About-AFB/More-about-AFB/History/ AF Bostäder History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714071441/http://www.afbostader.se/en/About-AFB/More-about-AFB/History/ |date=2008-07-14 }}</ref>

=== Student unions ===
[[Image:Delphi Panorama2007.jpg|thumb|The Delphi residential area, located in the northern part of Lund, is one of the large student housing complexes run by AF Bostäder.]]
The student unions represent students in various decision-making boards within the university and council students regarding their rights, housing and career options. There are nine student unions, one for each faculty and an [https://web.archive.org/web/20191204152124/https://www.ldk.lu.se/ additional union for doctoral students]. [[Lund's Doctoral Student Union]] is further divided into councils, one for each faculty except for the faculties of engineering and fine and performing arts.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120330180431/http://93.182.167.71/nya-af/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/International.Guide_.2010_Web.pdf Studentlund, International Guide 2010]</ref>

The unions are incorporated into the Association of Lund University Student Unions (LUS). It has two full-time representatives who go to weekly meetings with the vice-chancellor and other organizational university bodies. The student union association runs services such as loan institute, a day-care centre and a website with housing information. It also publishes the monthly Lundagård magazine.
