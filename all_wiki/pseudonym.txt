A '''pseudonym''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|uː|d|ən|ɪ|m}}) or '''alias''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|l|i|ə|s}}) is a fictitious name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which differs from their original or true name ([[orthonym]]).<ref>Room (2010, 3).</ref><ref>{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|pseudonym}}</ref> This also differs from a new name that entirely or legally replaces an individual's own. The pseudonym identifies one or more persons who have [[Personal name|true name]]s (that is, legal identities) but do not publicly disclose them.<ref>[[Timothy C. May|May, Timothy C.]] (1991).

==Scope==
Pseudonyms include [[stage name]]s and [[User (computing)|user names]], [[ring name]]s, [[pen name]]s, [[nickname]]s, aliases, [[superhero]] or villain identities and code names, gamer identifications, and [[regnal name]]s of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have sometimes taken the form of [[anagram]]s, Graecisms, and [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinisations]], although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.<ref>Peschke (2006, vii).</ref>

Pseudonyms should not be confused with new names that replace old ones and become the individual's full-time name. Pseudonyms are "part-time" names, used only in certain contexts – to provide a more clear-cut separation between one's private and professional lives, to showcase or enhance a particular persona, or to hide an individual's real identity, as with writers' pen names, graffiti artists' tags, [[Resistance movement|resistance fighters']] or terrorists' ''noms de guerre'', and computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]]' [[User (computing)|handles]]. [[Actor]]s, voice-over artists, musicians, and other performers sometimes use [[stage name]]s, for example, to better channel a relevant energy, gain a greater sense of security and comfort via privacy, more easily avoid troublesome fans/"stalkers", or to mask their ethnic backgrounds.

In some cases, pseudonyms are adopted because they are part of a cultural or organisational tradition: for example [[Religious name|devotional names]] used by members of some [[religious institute]]s, and "cadre names" used by [[Communist party]] leaders such as [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] and [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].

A pseudonym may also be used for personal reasons: for example, an individual may prefer to be called or known by a name that differs from their given or [[legal name]], but is not ready to take the numerous steps to get their name [[Name change|legally changed]]; or an individual may simply feel that the context and content of an exchange offer no reason, legal or otherwise, to provide their given or legal name.

A ''collective name'' or ''collective pseudonym'' is one shared by two or more persons, for example the co-authors of a work, such as [[Carolyn Keene]], [[Erin Hunter]] [[Ellery Queen]], [[Nicolas Bourbaki]], or [[James S. A. Corey]].

==Etymology==
The term ''pseudonym'' is derived from the Greek {{lang|el|ψευδώνυμον}} (''pseudṓnymon''),<ref>{{OEtymD|pseudonym|accessdate=2 August 2020}}</ref> literally "false name", from {{lang|grc|ψεῦδος}} (''pseûdos''), "lie, falsehood"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dyeu%3Ddos ψεῦδος],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project</ref> and {{lang|grc|ὄνομα}} (''ónoma''), "name".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29%2Fnoma ὄνομα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project</ref> The term ''alias'' is a Latin [[adverb]] meaning "at another time, elsewhere".<ref>Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, & Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928</ref>

==Distinction from allonyms, ghost writers and pseudepigrapha==

A pseudonym is distinct from an ''allonym'', which is the (real) name of another person, assumed by the author of a work of art.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Turco|first1=Lewis|title=The Book of Literary Terms: The Genres of Fiction, Drama, Nonfiction, Literary Criticism, and Scholarship|date=1999|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Hanover and London|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofliteraryte0000turc/page/182 182]|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofliteraryte0000turc|url-access=registration|quote=allonym.|access-date=17 October 2017}}</ref> This may occur when someone is [[ghostwriting]] a book or play, or in [[parody]], or when using a "front" name, such as by screenwriters [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] in Hollywood in the 1950s and 1960s. See also [[pseudepigraph]], for ''falsely'' attributed authorship.

==Usage==
===Name change===
{{Main|Name change}}
Sometimes people change their name in such a manner that the new name becomes permanent and is used by all who know the person. This is not an alias or pseudonym, but in fact a new name. In many countries, including [[common law]] countries, a name change can be ratified by a court and become a person's new legal name.

For example, in the 1960s, civil rights campaigner [[Malcolm X]], originally known as Malcolm Little, changed his surname to "X" to represent his unknown African ancestral name that had been lost when his ancestors were brought to North America as slaves. He then changed his name again to Malik El-Shabazz when he converted to Islam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/malcolm-x-1779823|title=Biography of Malcolm X, Black Nationalist and Civil Rights Activitist|website=ThoughtCo}}</ref>

Likewise some Jews adopted Hebrew family names upon immigrating to Israel, dropping surnames that had been in their families for generations. The politician [[David Ben-Gurion]], for example, was born David Grün in Poland. He adopted his Hebrew name in 1910, when he published his first article in a Zionist journal in Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/biography-david-ben-gurion/5810.aspx|title= Biography David Ben-Gurion: For the Love of Zion|access-date=1 June 2017}}</ref>

===Concealing identity===
====Business====
Businesspersons of ethnic minorities in some parts of the world are sometimes advised by an employer to use a pseudonym that is common or acceptable in that area when conducting business, to overcome racial or religious bias.<ref>Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and ''The New York Times (N.Y.: Random House, [2nd printing?] 1992 ({{ISBN|0-394-58452-X}})), p. 221. In 1968, one such employer was [[The New York Times]], the affected workers were classified-advertising takers, and the renaming was away from Jewish, Irish, and Italian names to ones "with a [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] flavor".</ref>

====Criminal activity====
Criminals may use aliases, [[fictitious business names]], and [[dummy corporations]] ([[corporate shells]]) to hide their identity, or to impersonate other persons or entities in order to commit fraud. Aliases and fictitious business names used for dummy corporations may become so complex that, in the words of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "getting to the truth requires a walk down a bizarre labyrinth" and multiple government agencies may become involved to uncover the truth.<ref name=RTR>The Ruse That Roared, ''The Washington Post'', 5 November 1995, Richard Leiby, James Lileks</ref> Giving a false name to a law enforcement officer is a crime in many jurisdictions; see [[identity fraud]].

====Literature====
[[File:Die junge George Sand.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A young [[George Sand]] (real name "Amantine Lucile Dupin")]]

A [[pen name]], or ''"nom de plume"'' (French for "pen name"), is a pseudonym (sometimes a particular form of the real name) adopted by an [[author]] (or on the author's behalf by their publishers).

Although the term is most frequently used today with regard to identity and the Internet, the concept of pseudonymity has a long history. In ancient literature it was common to write in the name of a famous person, not for concealment or with any intention of deceit; in the New Testament, the second letter of Peter is probably such. A more modern example is all of ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', which were signed by Publius, a pseudonym representing the trio of [[James Madison]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], and [[John Jay]].  The papers were written partially in response to several [[Anti-Federalist Papers]], also written under pseudonyms.  As a result of this pseudonymity, historians know that the papers were written by Madison, Hamilton, and Jay, but have not been able to discern with complete accuracy which of the three authored a few of the papers.  There are also examples of modern politicians and high-ranking bureaucrats writing under pseudonyms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/hillary-clinton-emails-fbi-228607|title=Obama used a pseudonym in emails with Clinton, FBI documents reveal|first1=Josh|last1=Gerstein|first2=Nolan D.|last2=Mccaskill|website=POLITICO}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/regulation/energy-environment/297255-former-epa-chief-under-fire-for-new-batch-of-richard-windsor-emails|title=Former EPA chief under fire for new batch of 'Richard Windsor' emails|first=Dustin|last=Weaver|date=1 May 2013|website=TheHill}}</ref>

Some female authors used male pen names, in particular in the 19th century, when writing was a male-dominated profession. The [[Brontë family|Brontë sisters]] used pen names for their early work, so as not to reveal their gender (see below) and so that local residents would not know that the books related to people of the neighbourhood. The Brontës used their neighbours as inspiration for characters in many of their books. [[Anne Brontë]]'s ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' (1848) was published under the name Acton Bell, while [[Charlotte Brontë]] used the name Currer Bell for ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' (1847) and ''[[Shirley (novel)|Shirley]]'' (1849), and [[Emily Brontë]] adopted Ellis Bell as cover for ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' (1847). Other examples from the nineteenth-century are the novelist Mary Ann Evans ([[George Eliot]]) and the French writer Amandine Aurore Lucile Dupin ([[George Sand]]). Pseudonyms may also be used due to cultural or organization or political prejudices.

On the other hand, some 20th and 21st-century male romance novelists have used female pen names.<ref name=maleauthors>{{cite news |last=Naughton |first=Julie |title=Yes, Virgil, There Are Men Writing Romance: Focus on Romance 2012 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/52473-yes-virgil-there-are-men-writing-romance-focus-on-romance-2012.html |access-date=6 May 2014 |newspaper=Publishers Weekly |date=1 June 2012}}</ref> A few examples are Brindle Chase, [[Peter O'Donnell]] (as Madeline Brent), [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] (as Penny Sutton and Rosie Dixon), and [[Hugh C. Rae]] (as Jessica Sterling).<ref name="maleauthors" />

A pen name may be used if a writer's real name is likely to be confused with the name of another writer or notable individual, or if the real name is deemed unsuitable.

Authors who write both fiction and non-fiction, or in different genres, may use different pen names to avoid confusing their readers. For example, the romance writer [[Nora Roberts]] writes mystery novels under the name [[J.D. Robb]].

In some cases, an author may become better known by his pen name than his real name. Some famous examples of that include Samuel Clemens, writing as [[Mark Twain]], and Theodor Geisel, better known as [[Dr. Seuss]]. The British mathematician Charles Dodgson wrote fantasy novels as [[Lewis Carroll]] and mathematical treatises under his own name.

Some authors, such as [[Harold Robbins]], use several literary pseudonyms.<ref>[http://www.trussel.com/books/pseud_r.htm Rubin, Harold Francis (1916–)], Author Pseudonyms: R. Accessed 27 November 2009.</ref>

Some pen names have been used for long periods, even decades, without the author's true identity being discovered, as with [[Elena Ferrante]] and [[Torsten Krol]].

Some pen names are not strictly pseudonyms, as they are simply variants of the authors' actual names. The authors [[C. L. Moore|C.L. Moore]] and [[S. E. Hinton|S.E. Hinton]] were female authors who used the initialled forms of their full names, Moore being Catherine Lucille Moore, writing in the 1930s male-dominated science fiction genre, and Hinton, (author of ''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]'') Susan Eloise Hinton. ''[[Star Trek]]'' writer [[D. C. Fontana|D.C. Fontana]] (Dorothy Catherine) wrote using her own abbreviated name and under the pen names Michael Richards and J. Michael Bingham. Author [[V. C. Andrews|V.C. Andrews]] intended to publish under her given name, Virginia Andrews, but was told that, due to a production error, her first novel was being released under the name of "V.C. Andrews"; later she learned that her publisher had in fact done this deliberately. [[Joanne Rowling]]<ref>{{Cite web| title = J.K. Rowling| access-date = 5 August 2020| date = c. 2019| url = https://www.jkrowling.com/about/}}</ref> published the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series as [[J. K. Rowling|J.K. Rowling]].<!-- See article for further explanation, keep it simple here --> Rowling also published the [[Cormoran Strike]] series, a series of detective novels including ''[[The Cuckoo's Calling]]'' under the pseudonym "Robert Galbraith".

[[Winston Churchill]] wrote as [[Winston Churchill as writer|Winston S. Churchill]] (from his full surname "Spencer-Churchill" which he did not otherwise use) in an attempt to avoid confusion with an [[Winston Churchill (novelist)|American novelist of the same name]]. The attempt was not wholly successful – the two are still sometimes confused by booksellers.<ref>{{cite web |last=The Age 19 October 1940, hosted on Google News |title=Two Winston Churchills |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&dat=19401019&id=QJZVAAAAIBAJ&pg=4893,3645349 |access-date=25 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=My Early Life – 1874–1904, hosted on Google Books |title=Oldham |date=11 May 2010 |isbn=9781439125069 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2EK2khQWfsC&q=%22mr.+winston+churchill+makes+haste+to+add%22&pg=PA218 |access-date=25 October 2013}}</ref>

A pen name may be used specifically to hide the identity of the author, as with [[Exposé (journalism)|exposé]] books about espionage or crime, or explicit erotic fiction. Some prolific authors adopt a pseudonym to disguise the extent of their published output, e. g. [[Stephen King]] writing as [[Richard Bachman]]. Co-authors may choose to publish under a collective pseudonym, e. g., [[P. J. Tracy]] and [[Perri O'Shaughnessy]]. [[Frederic Dannay]] and [[Manfred Lee]] used the name [[Ellery Queen]] as a pen name for their collaborative works and as the name of their main character.{{cn|date=May 2020}} [[Asa Earl Carter]], a Southern white segregationist affiliated with the KKK, wrote Western books under a fictional Cherokee persona to imply legitimacy and conceal his history.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Carter |first1=Dan T. |author-link1=Dan T.

"Why do authors choose pseudonyms? It is rarely because they actually hope to stay anonymous forever," mused writer and columnist [[Russell Smith (writer)|Russell Smith]] in his review of the Canadian novel ''Into That Fire'' by the pseudonymous M.J. Cates.<ref>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Russell |date=19 February 2019 |title=Review: Into That Fire is promising in its themes and canvas ... |work=Globe and Mail}}</ref>

A famous case in French literature was [[Romain Gary]]. Already a well-known writer, he started publishing books as [[Émile Ajar]] to test whether his new books would be well received on their own merits, without the aid of his established reputation. They were: Émile Ajar, like Romain Gary before him, was awarded the prestigious [[Prix Goncourt]] by a jury unaware that they were the same person. Similarly, TV actor [[Ronnie Barker]] submitted comedy material under the name Gerald Wiley.

A collective pseudonym may represent an entire publishing house, or any contributor to a long-running series, especially with juvenile literature. Examples include [[Watty Piper]], [[Victor Appleton]], [[Erin Hunter]], and Kamiru M. Xhan.

Another use of a pseudonym in literature is to present a story as being written by the fictional characters in the story. The series of novels known as ''[[A Series Of Unfortunate Events]]'' are written by [[Daniel Handler]] under the pen name of [[Lemony Snicket]], a character in the series. This applies also to some of the several 18th-century English and American writers who used the name [[Fidelia (pseudonym)|Fidelia]].

An '''anonymity pseudonym''' or [[multiple-use name]] is a name used by many different people to protect anonymity.<ref Name="Home">{{cite book

{{Refimprove section|date=September 2016}}

In [[Ancien Régime]] France, a ''nom de guerre'' ("war name") would be adopted by each new recruit (or assigned to them by the captain of their company) as they enlisted in the French army. These pseudonyms had an official character and were the predecessor of [[Dog tag|identification numbers]]: soldiers were identified by their first names, their family names, and their ''noms de guerre'' (e. g. ''Jean Amarault dit Lafidélité''). These pseudonyms were usually related to the soldier's place of origin (e. g. ''Jean Deslandes dit Champigny'', for a soldier coming from a town named [[Champigny (disambiguation)|Champigny]]), or to a particular physical or personal trait (e. g. ''Antoine Bonnet dit Prettaboire'', for a soldier ''prêt à boire'', ready to drink). In 1716, a ''nom de guerre'' was mandatory for every soldier; officers did not adopt ''noms de guerre'' as they considered them derogatory. In daily life, these aliases could replace the real family name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.histori.ca/prodev/article.do?id=15333 |title=Home &#124; Historica – Dominion |publisher=Historica |access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref>

''Noms de guerre'' were adopted for security reasons by members of the World War II [[French resistance]] and [[Polish underground state|Polish resistance]]. Such pseudonyms are often adopted by military special-forces soldiers, such as members of the SAS and similar units of [[Resistance movement|resistance fighters]], terrorists, and [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]]. This practice hides their identities and may protect their families from reprisals; it may also be a form of dissociation from domestic life. Some well-known men who adopted ''noms de guerre'' include Carlos, for [[Ilich Ramírez Sánchez]]; [[Willy Brandt]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] of [[West Germany]]; and [[Subcomandante Marcos]], spokesman of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} During [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]'s underground fight against the British in [[Mandatory Palestine]], the organization's commander [[Yitzchak Shamir]] (later Prime Minister of Israel) adopted the ''nom de guerre'' "Michael", in honour of Ireland's [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]].

Revolutionaries and resistance leaders, such as [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], [[Golda Meir]], [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]], and [[Josip Broz Tito]], often adopted their ''noms de guerre'' as their proper names after the struggle. [[George Grivas]], the Greek-Cypriot [[EOKA]] militant, adopted the ''nom de guerre'' Digenis (Διγενής). In the [[French Foreign Legion]], recruits can adopt a pseudonym to break with their past lives. Mercenaries have long used "noms de guerre", sometimes even multiple identities, depending on country, conflict and circumstance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Some of the most familiar noms de guerre today are the [[Kunya (Arabic)|kunya]] used by Islamic [[mujahideen]]. These take the form of a [[teknonym]], either literal or figurative.

====Online activity====
Individuals using a computer [[online]] may adopt or be required to use a form of pseudonym known as a "handle" (a term deriving from [[CB slang]]), "[[User (computing)|user]] name", "[[Logging (computer security)|login]] name", "[[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]]", or, sometimes, "[[Screen name (computing)|screen name]]", "[[gamertag]]" "IGN ('''I'''n '''G'''ame ('''N'''ick)'''N'''ame)" or "[[nickname]]". On the Internet, [[pseudonymous remailer]]s use [[cryptography]] that achieves persistent [[pseudonymity]], so that two-way communication can be achieved, and reputations can be established, without linking physical [[identity theft|identities]] to their respective pseudonyms. [[Aliasing (computing)|Aliasing]] is the use of multiple names for the same data location.

More sophisticated cryptographic systems, such as anonymous [[digital credential]]s, enable users to communicate pseudonymously (i. e., by identifying themselves by means of pseudonyms). In well-defined abuse cases, a designated authority may be able to revoke the pseudonyms and reveal the individuals' real identity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Use of pseudonyms is common among professional [[eSports]] players, despite the fact that many professional games are played on [[LAN]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ongamers.com/articles/why-esports-needs-to-ditch-online-aliases/1100-205/ |title=Why esports needs to ditch online aliases |first=Taylor |last=Cocke |date=26 November 2013 |access-date=14 May 2015}}</ref>

Pseudonymity has become an important phenomenon on the Internet and other computer networks.  In computer networks, pseudonyms possess varying degrees of anonymity,<ref>Froomkin, A. Michael (1995). [http://www.wm.edu/law/publications/jol/95_96/froomkin.html "Anonymity and Its Enemies (Article 4)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525021152/http://www.wm.edu/law/publications/jol/95_96/froomkin.html |date=25 May 2008 }}". ''Journal of Online Law.''</ref> ranging from highly linkable ''public pseudonyms'' (the link between the pseudonym and a human being is publicly known or easy to discover), potentially linkable ''non-public pseudonyms'' (the link is known to system operators but is not publicly disclosed), and ''unlinkable pseudonyms'' (the link is not known to system operators and cannot be determined).<ref>Pfitzmann, A., and M. Köhntopp (2000).  "[http://dud.inf.tu-dresden.de/literatur/Anon_Terminology_v0.23.pdf Anonymity, Unobservability, and Pseudonymity: A Proposal for Terminology]". In H. Federrath (ed.), ''Anonymity'' (Berlin: Springer-Verlag), pp. 1-9.</ref>  For example, true [[anonymous remailer]] enables Internet users to establish unlinkable pseudonyms; those that employ non-public pseudonyms (such as the now-defunct [[Penet remailer]]) are called [[pseudonymous remailer]]s.

The continuum of unlinkability can also be seen, in part, on Wikipedia. Some registered users make no attempt to disguise their real identities (for example, by placing their real name on their user page). The pseudonym of unregistered users is their [[IP address]], which can, in many cases, easily be linked to them. Other registered users prefer to remain anonymous, and do not disclose identifying information. However, in certain cases, {{srlink|Wikipedia:Privacy Policy|Wikipedia's privacy policy}} permits system administrators to consult the server logs to determine the IP address, and perhaps the true name, of a registered user. It is possible, in theory, to create an unlinkable Wikipedia pseudonym by using an [[Open proxy]], a Web server that disguises the user's IP address. But most open proxy addresses are blocked indefinitely due to their frequent use by vandals (see {{srlink|Wikipedia:Blocking policy}}).  Additionally, Wikipedia's public record of a user's interest areas, writing style, and argumentative positions may still establish an identifiable pattern.<ref>Rao, J.R., and P. Rohatgi (2000).

System operators ([[sysops]]) at sites offering pseudonymity, such as Wikipedia, are not likely to build unlinkability into their systems, as this would render them unable to obtain  information about abusive users quickly enough to stop vandalism and other undesirable behaviors. Law enforcement personnel, fearing an avalanche of illegal behavior are equally unenthusiastic.<ref>Clarke, Roger (1998). [http://www.anu.edu.au/people/Roger.Clarke/II/ICrimPrev.html "Technological Aspects of Internet Crime Prevention."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814085625/http://www.anu.edu.au/people/Roger.Clarke/II/ICrimPrev.html |date=14 August 2008 }}  Paper presented at the Australian Institute for Criminology's Conference on Internet Crime ( 16–17 February 1998).</ref> Still, some users and privacy activists like the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] believe that Internet users deserve stronger pseudonymity so that they can protect themselves against identity theft, illegal government surveillance, stalking, and other unwelcome consequences of Internet use (including [[Internet leak|unintentional disclosures of their personal information]] and [[doxing]], as discussed in the next section). Their views are supported by laws in some nations (such as Canada) that guarantee citizens a right to speak using a pseudonym.<ref>{{Cite web|date=20 April 2001|title=EFF Press Release: Federal Court Upholds Online Anonymous Speech in 2TheMart.com case|url=https://www.eff.org/legal/cases/2TheMart_case/20010420_eff_2themart_pr.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211074611/https://www.eff.org/legal/cases/2TheMart_case/20010420_eff_2themart_pr.html|archive-date=11 December 2006|access-date=1 July 2020}}</ref> This right does not, however, give citizens the right to demand publication of pseudonymous speech on equipment they do not own.

=====Confidentiality=====

Most Web sites that offer pseudonymity retain information about users. <!-- They  should protect their users from unwanted disclosures of personal information; in other words, they should assure confidentiality (the information is available only to those authorized to have access). COMMENT:  it is not encyclopedic to talk about what web sites should or shouldn't do.  This could be reworded to discuss the benefits to assuring confidentiality (referenced of course), but I do not know enough about the issue to do it. --> These sites are often susceptible to unauthorized intrusions into their non-public database systems. For example, in 2000, a Welsh teenager obtained information about more than 26,000 credit card accounts, including that of Bill Gates.<ref>Reuters News Service (2000). [http://news.cnet.com/2100-1017-238427.html?legacy=cnet "Report: Hackers Had Gates' Credit Card Data"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (26 March 2000).</ref> In 2003, VISA and MasterCard announced that intruders obtained information about 5.6 million credit cards.<ref>Katayama, F. (2003) [http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/02/17/creditcard.hack/ "Hacker accesses 5.6 Million Credit Cards" ''CNN.com: Technology (February 18, 2003).]</ref> Sites that offer pseudonymity are also vulnerable to confidentiality breaches. In a study of a Web dating service and a [[pseudonymous remailer]], [[University of Cambridge]] researchers discovered that the systems used by these Web sites to protect user data could be easily compromised, even if the pseudonymous channel is protected by strong encryption. Typically, the protected pseudonymous channel exists within a broader framework in which multiple vulnerabilities exist.<ref>{{cite book | doi = 10.1007/3-540-45496-9_17 | last1 = Clayton | first1 = R. | last2 = Danezis | first2 = G. | last3 = Kuhn | first3 = M. | year = 2001 | title = Real World Patterns of Failure in Anonymity Systems | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rnc1/Patterns_of_Failure.pdf | volume = 2137 | pages = 230–244 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | isbn = 978-3-540-42733-9 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.16.7923 }}</ref> Pseudonym users should bear in mind that, given the current state of Web security engineering, their true names may be revealed at any time.

=====Online reputations=====
Pseudonymity is an important component of the reputation systems found in online auction services (such as [[eBay]]), discussion sites (such as [[Slashdot]]), and collaborative knowledge development sites (such as Wikipedia). A pseudonymous user who has acquired a favorable reputation gains the trust of other users. When users believe that they will be rewarded by acquiring a favorable reputation, they are more likely to behave in accordance with the site's policies.<ref>[[Peter Kollock|Kollock, P]]. (1999). [http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/faculty/kollock/papers/online_trust.htm "The Production of Trust in Online Markets."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226160128/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/faculty/kollock/papers/online_trust.htm |date=26 February 2009 }} In E.J. Lawler, M. Macy, S. Thyne, and H.A. Walker (eds.), ''Advances in Group Processes'' (Greenwich, CT: JAI Press).</ref>

If users can obtain new pseudonymous identities freely or at very low cost, reputation-based systems are vulnerable to whitewashing attacks,<ref>Feldman, M., S. Papadimitriou, and J. Chuang (2004). "Free-Riding and Whitewashing in Peer-to-Peer Systems." Paper presented at SIGCOMM '04 Workship (Portland, Oregon, 30 Aug. – 3 September 2004).</ref> also called ''serial pseudonymity'', in which abusive users continuously discard their old identities and acquire new ones in order to escape the consequences of their behavior: "On the Internet, nobody knows that yesterday you were a dog, and therefore should be in the doghouse today."<ref name="friedman-resnick">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1162/105864001300122476 | last1 = Friedman | first1 = E. | last2 = Resnick | first2 = P. | year = 2001 | title = The Social Cost of Cheap Pseudonyms | url = http://www.si.umich.edu/~presnick/papers/identifiers/081199.pdf | journal = Journal of Economics and Management Strategy | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 173–199 | hdl = 2027.42/71559 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081123102704/http://www.si.umich.edu/~presnick/papers/identifiers/081199.pdf | archive-date = 23 November 2008 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.30.6376 }}</ref> Users of Internet communities who have been banned only to return with new identities are called [[Internet sock puppet|sock puppets]].

====Privacy====
People seeking privacy often use pseudonyms to make appointments and reservations.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Harriet |last1=Ryan |first2=Kimi |last2=Yoshino |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-jackson17-2009jul17,0,3782664.story |title=Investigators target Michael Jackson's pseudonyms |work=Latimes.com |date=17 July 2009 |access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref> Those writing to [[advice column]]s in newspapers and magazines may use pseudonyms.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?nid=4TOpqqG69KYC&dat=18830407&printsec=frontpage |title=''Toronto Daily Mail, "Women's Kingdom", "A Delicate Question", April 7, 1883, page 5 |access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref> [[Steve Wozniak]] used a pseudonym when attending the [[University of California, Berkeley]] after co-founding [[Apple Computer]], because "I knew I wouldn't have time enough to be an A+ student."<ref name="stix19860514">{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1986-05-14/news/vw-5389_1_steve-wozniak |title=A UC Berkeley Degree Is Now the Apple of Steve Wozniak's Eye |work=Los Angeles Times |date=14 May 1986 |access-date=5 January 2015 |author=Stix, Harriet}}</ref>

===Stage names===
{{main|Stage name}}
When used by an actor, musician, radio disc jockey, model, or other performer or "show business" personality a pseudonym is called a ''stage name'', or, occasionally, a ''professional name'', or ''screen name''.

====Film, theatre, and related activities====
Members of a marginalized ethnic or religious group have often adopted stage names, typically changing their surname or entire name to mask their original background.

Stage names are also used to create a more marketable name, as in the case of Creighton Tull Chaney, who adopted the pseudonym [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]], a reference to his famous father [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]

[[Chris Curtis]] of [[Deep Purple]] fame was christened as Christopher Crummey ("crumby" is UK slang for poor quality). In this and similar cases a stage name is adopted simply to avoid an unfortunate pun.

Pseudonyms are also used to comply with the rules of performing-arts [[guild]]s ([[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG), [[Writers Guild of America, East]] (WGA), [[AFTRA]], etc.), which do not allow performers to use an existing name, in order to avoid confusion. For example, these rules required film and television actor Michael Fox to add a middle initial and become [[Michael J. Fox]], to avoid being confused with another actor named [[Michael Fox (American actor)|Michael Fox]]. This was also true of author and actress [[Fannie Flagg]], who chose this pseudonym; her real name, Patricia Neal, being the name of [[Patricia Neal|another well-known actress]]; and British actor [[Stewart Granger]], whose real name was James Stewart. The film-making team of [[Coen brothers|Joel and Ethan Coen]], for instance, share credit for editing under the alias Roderick Jaynes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/01/roderick_jaynes_imaginary_osca.html |title=Roderick Jaynes, Imaginary Oscar Nominee for 'No Country' – Vulture |publisher=Nymag.com |access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref>

Some stage names are used to conceal a person's identity, such as the pseudonym [[Alan Smithee]], which was used by directors in the [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA) to remove their name from a film they feel was edited or modified beyond their artistic satisfaction. In theatre, the pseudonyms [[George Spelvin (pseudonym)|George or Georgina Spelvin]], and [[Walter Plinge]] are used to hide the identity of a performer, usually when he or she is "doubling" (playing more than one role in the same play).

[[David Agnew]] was a name used by the BBC to conceal the identity of a scriptwriter, such as for the [[Doctor Who]] serial [[City of Death]], which had three writers, including [[Douglas Adams]], who was at the time of writing the show's Script Editor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/cityofdeath/detail.shtml|title=BBC – Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide – City of Death – Details|work=bbc.co.uk|access-date=18 July 2015}}</ref> In another Doctor Who serial, [[The Brain of Morbius]], writer [[Terrance Dicks]] demanded the removal of his name from the credits saying it could go out under a "bland pseudonym".{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}<ref name="codenames"/> This ended up as ''Robin Bland''.<ref name="codenames">{{cite web |first=William |last=Gallagher |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-03-27/doctor-whos-secret-history-of-codenames-revealed |title=Doctor Who's secret history of codenames revealed |work=[[Radio Times]] |date=27 March 2012 |access-date=31 March 2013 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227211038/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-03-27/doctor-whos-secret-history-of-codenames-revealed |archive-date=27 February 2015}}</ref><ref>Howe, Walker and Stammers ''Doctor Who the Handbook: The Fourth Doctor'' pp. 175–176.</ref>

====Music====
{{sources|section|date=September 2018}}
Musicians and singers can use pseudonyms to allow artists to collaborate with artists on other labels while avoiding the need to gain permission from their own labels, such as the artist [[Jerry Samuels]], who made songs under Napoleon XIV. Rock singer-guitarist [[George Harrison]], for example, played guitar on [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s song "[[Badge (song)|Badge]]" using a pseudonym.<ref name="John Wynn">{{cite book |last=Winn |first=John |year=2009 |title=That Magic Feeling: The Beatles' Recorded Legacy, Volume Two, 1966–1970 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |isbn=978-0-307-45239-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdsMqbAQJWgC |page=229}}</ref> In classical music, some record companies issued recordings under a ''nom de disque'' in the 1950s and 1960s to avoid paying royalties. A number of popular budget LPs of piano music were released under the pseudonym [[Paul Procopolis]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Another example is that [[Paul McCartney]] used his fictional name "Bernerd Webb" for [[Peter and Gordon]]'s song [[Woman (Paul McCartney song)|Woman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.45cat.com/record/5579 |title=45cat - Peter And Gordon - Woman / Wrong From The Start - Capitol - USA - 5579 |publisher=45cat |access-date=30 June 2018}}</ref>

Pseudonyms are used as stage names in [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, such as [[Tracii Guns]] in [[LA Guns]], [[Axl Rose]] and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] in [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Mick Mars]] in [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Dimebag Darrell]] in [[Pantera]], or [[C.C. Deville]] in [[Poison (American band)|Poison]]. Some such names have additional meanings, like that of Brian Hugh Warner, more commonly known as [[Marilyn Manson]]: Marilyn coming from [[Marilyn Monroe]] and Manson from convicted serial killer [[Charles Manson]]. [[Jacoby Shaddix]] of [[Papa Roach]] went under the name "Coby Dick" during the ''[[Infest (album)|Infest]]'' era. He changed back to his birth name when ''[[lovehatetragedy]]'' was released.

[[David Johansen]], front man for the hard rock band [[New York Dolls]], recorded and performed pop and lounge music under the pseudonym Buster Poindexter in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The music video for Poindexter's debt single, [[Hot Hot Hot (Arrow song)#Buster Poindexter version|Hot Hot Hot]], opens with a monologue from Johansen where he notes his time with the New York Dolls and explains his desire to create more sophisticated music. 

[[Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.]], creator of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]], wrote original songs, arranged, and produced the records under his real name, but performed on them as [[David Seville]]. He also wrote songs as Skipper Adams. Danish pop pianist [[Bent Fabric]], whose full name is Bent Fabricius-Bjerre, wrote his biggest instrumental hit "[[Alley Cat (song)|Alley Cat]]" as Frank Bjorn.

For a time, the musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] used an unpronounceable "[[Prince (musician)#Stage names|Love Symbol]]" as a pseudonym ("Prince" is his actual first name rather than a stage name). He wrote the song "[[Sugar Walls]]" for [[Sheena Easton]] as "Alexander Nevermind" and "[[Manic Monday]]" for [[The Bangles]] as "Christopher Tracy". (He also produced albums early in his career as "Jamie Starr").

Many Italian-American singers have used stage names, as their birth names were difficult to pronounce or considered too ethnic for American tastes. Singers changing their names included [[Dean Martin]] (born Dino Paul Crocetti), [[Connie Francis]] (born Concetta Franconero), [[Frankie Valli]] (born Francesco Castelluccio), [[Tony Bennett]] (born Anthony Benedetto), and [[Lady Gaga]] (born Stefani Germanotta)

In 2009, the British rock band [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] briefly changed its name to [[Renegades (band)|Renegades]] so it could play a whole show featuring a set list in which 95 per cent of the songs played were from their forthcoming new album of the same name, with none of their singles included. Front man [[Grant Nicholas]] felt that if they played as Feeder, there would be uproar over him not playing any of the singles, so used the pseudonym as a hint. A series of small shows were played in 2010, at 250- to 1,000-capacity venues with the plan not to say who the band really are and just announce the shows as if they were a new band.

In many cases, hip-hop and rap artists prefer to use pseudonyms that represents some variation of their name, personality, or interests. Examples include [[Iggy Azalea]] (her stage name is a combination of her dog's name, Iggy, and her home street in [[Mullumbimby]], Azalea Street), [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] (known under at least six aliases), [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] (previously known at various times as Puffy, P. Diddy, and Puff Daddy), [[Ludacris]], [[Flo Rida]] (whose stage name is a tribute to his home state, [[Florida]]), British-Jamaican hip-hop artist [[Stefflon Don]] (real name Stephanie Victoria Allen), [[LL Cool J]], and [[Chingy]]. [[Black metal]] artists also adopt pseudonyms, usually symbolizing dark values, such as [[Nocturno Culto]], [[Gaahl]], Abbath, and Silenoz. In punk and hardcore punk, singers and band members often replace real names with tougher-sounding stage names such as [[Sid Vicious]] (real name John Simon Ritchie) of the late 1970s band [[Sex Pistols]] and "Rat" of the early 1980s band [[The Varukers]] and the 2000s re-formation of [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]. The punk rock band [[The Ramones]] had every member take the last name of Ramone.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Henry John Deutschendorf Jr., an American singer-songwriter, used the stage name [[John Denver]]. The Australian country musician born Robert Lane changed his name to [[Tex Morton]]. Reginald Kenneth Dwight legally changed his name in 1972 to [[Elton John]].
