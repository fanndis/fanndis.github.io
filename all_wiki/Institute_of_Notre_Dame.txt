The '''Institute of Notre Dame''' was a private [[Catholic]] all-girls high school located in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. After 173 years, the school closed on June 30, 2020.

==History==
The Institute of Notre Dame, known as "IND" or "the Institute" by those who are familiar with the school, was founded in 1847, making it the first school founded by the [[School Sisters of Notre Dame]] in the United States. The founder of the school is Mother [[Theresa Gerhardinger]], now [[beatified]] in the [[Catholic Church]]. The school is unique in the fact that it has remained in its downtown location on Aisquith Street since its founding. Currently, around 286 young women attend the school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/361|title=Institute of Notre Dame|first=The Explore Baltimore Heritage|last=team|website=Explore Baltimore Heritage|accessdate=May 6, 2020}}</ref>

In September 2010, IND was named Best Private School for the "Wi-Fi" Generation" by Baltimore magazine for its one-to-one student tablet PC program, which integrates technology across the curriculum. The historic building is fully wireless.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoremagazine.com/2010/8/31/the-best-public-private-high-schools|title=The Best Public & Private High Schools|first=Baltimore|last=magazine|date=Aug 31, 2010|website=Baltimore magazine|accessdate=May 6, 2020}}</ref>

In 2000, Spanish teacher William Brown won a national award from [[National Catholic Educators Association]] for his efforts in education and conflict [[mediation]] at the school.

The school also has a partnership with [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] called "Bond to Bond", where students volunteer in different areas of the hospital.[http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/dome/0403/centerpiece.cfm Dome | Johns Hopkins Medicine]

The Institute of Notre Dame is very well known for its rivalry with [[Mercy High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Mercy High School]]. Once a year, the two schools' basketball teams match up to play a highly anticipated game in the [[Towson SECU Arena]] gym. To fans, this game is known as 'The Game' or the 'IND/Mercy Game'. Over 4000 people have been known to attend. As of 2019, the series stands at IND 24, Mercy 30.

Alumna [[Barbara Mikulski]], member of the class of 1954, had this to say about the school:
<blockquote>
"Attending the Institute of Notre Dame taught me that I could do anything I dreamed of doing. The [[Religious sisters|sisters]] were intelligent, caring and had incredible inner strength. They taught me more than geography or mathematics; they taught me to help those in need of help. They inspired my passion for service."[http://www.newsline.umd.edu/schools/girlsschool102805.htm]</blockquote>
On May 5, 2020, the Institute of Notre Dame announced they were scheduled to close permanently on June 30, 2020 due to COVID-19 and $5 million in structural damage from a church fire that occurred next door to the school in March 2020.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio described it as among the highest profile Catholic school closures of the year.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nieto del Rio|first=Giulia McDonnell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/05/us/catholic-school-closings.html|title=A Growing Number of Catholic Schools Are Shutting Down Forever|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2020-09-05|accessdate=2020-09-11}}</ref>
