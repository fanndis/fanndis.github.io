'''Lakas–CMD''' ('''Lakas ng Tao–Christian Muslim Democrats'''), popularly known as '''Lakas''', was a [[political party]] in the [[Philippines]]. Its ideology and that of its successor is heavily influenced by [[Christian democracy|Christian]] and [[Islamic democracy]]. The party's influence on [[Philippine]] society is very evident, especially after the [[People Power Revolution]], which has led the country to elect two presidents from the party, namely [[Fidel V. Ramos]], a [[United Methodist]], and [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], a [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholic]].

In May 2009, Lakas–CMD merged with Arroyo's [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino|KAMPI]] thereby being known as [[Lakas–CMD|Lakas–Kampi–CMD]], a completely new entity. On May 2012, Lakas–Kampi–CMD renamed itself again as Lakas–CMD after the separation of KAMPI.

==Ideology==
Lakas-CMD has always focused on economic growth and development, stronger ties with the [[United States]], creation of jobs, and strong cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of government. It is known for its advocacy of a shift from the present [[presidential system]] to a parliamentary form of government through constitutional amendments and through establishing peace talks with [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim]] separatists and [[communism|communist]] rebels. The party democracy is distinct in its ecumenical inclusion of Muslim leaders in its political alliance.<ref name= "Centre-right" >{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCrTDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA195&|title=Southeast Asia In The New International Era|date=2016|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}</ref>

==History==

===Early days and Ramos administration===
[[Image:Ramos Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|150px|President Fidel V. Ramos, co-founder of Lakas-NUCD.]]
Lakas ng Tao was formed in December 1991 for the [[1992 Philippine general election|1992 elections]] as retired General and then-Defense Secretary [[Fidel V. Ramos]] and former [[Cebu]] Governor [[Emilio Mario Osmeña|Emilio Mario R. Osmeña]] were running for president and vice-president, respectively. It was also formed when Ramos bolted from the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] (LDP; Struggle of Democratic Filipinos), after he had lost in the bid for the presidential nomination of that party to Speaker [[Ramon Mitra]].

The party was formed out of two parties: Ramos's '''Partido Lakas ng Tao''' (People Power Party) and the '''National Union of Christian Democrats''' (NUCD) of [[Raul Manglapus]]. As they coalesced, the party became known as Lakas ng Tao-National Union of Christian Democrats, with Lakas ng Tao usually just shortened to "Lakas" and abbreviated as Lakas-NUCD.

In 1994, it formed a coalition government with the LDP for the [[1995 Philippine general election|1995 legislative elections]].  This coalition, dubbed the "[[Lakas-Laban Coalition]]", won a majority in both Houses of Congress. In the 1997 Lakas National Convention, the party nominated House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia Jr.]] of [[Pangasinan]] after a close nominal fight with then-Defense Secretary [[Renato de Villa]] as its nominee to the presidency against the opposition's Vice President [[Joseph Estrada]] in the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]].  By this time, it was joined by the '''United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines''' (UMDP) of Sanchez A. Ali to form Lakas ng EDSA-National Union of Christian Democrats-United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines (Lakas-NUCD-UMDP).

Secretary de Villa eventually bolted the party and formed [[Partido ng Demokratikong Reporma]] (Democratic Reform Party) for the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]].  Lakas also nominated then-Senator [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] of [[Pampanga]] as its candidate as [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]]. Arroyo had originally intended to run for president under her party, [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino|Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI). De Venecia lost to Vice President Estrada by a significant plurality, while Arroyo won the vice presidency in the same manner while her KAMPI party was in hiatus.

===Arroyo administration===
{{Christian Democracy sidebar}} 
In the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 elections]], the name changed again to the current Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats, or Lakas-CMD.  However, the meaning of Lakas in the party name is usually now referred to as "Lakas ng [[EDSA I|EDSA]]" which means "The Strength of EDSA" than the original Lakas ng Tao which means "The Strength of the People" or "People Power."  This is also the name that it used when it ran in 2004 elections under the K-4 coalition.  President Arroyo, who succeeded the deposed President [[Joseph Estrada]], was the K-4 Coalition candidate for president in the 2004 election, eventually winning over her opponents primarily [[Fernando Poe Jr.]] and Senator [[Panfilo Lacson]].

At the onset of 2006, Lakas-CMD was torn by factional rivalry between supporters of President Arroyo and supporters of former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]].  Issues include transitory provisions in a proposed Constitution to scrap mid-term elections (or "no-el") set for 2007 and calls for her to step down in time for the elections, which is related to the "no-el" controversy. The party held its Annual Party Directorate Meeting on January 14, 2006 to discuss these matters.

There are no official results available of the 2007 [[elections in the Philippines|elections]] released by the party, but according to the [[Philippine House of Representatives]], the party held 79 out of 235 seats.

On January 16, 2008, Lakas spokesman and legal counsel [[Raul Lambino]] stated that Lakas-CMD officially released the list of senatorial bets for 2010—spokesman  in 2010. Except for Parañaque Representative Eduardo Zialcita, they were not yet identified. But Lambino named incumbent Senators [[Ramon Revilla Jr.]] and [[Lito Lapid]], former senator [[Ralph Recto]] and former Congressman [[Prospero Pichay]] as among those considered.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080116-112714/Lakas-lists-down-30-senatorial-bets-for-2010--spokesman  Inquirer.net, Lakas lists down 30 senatorial bets for 2010--spokesman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910230132/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080116-112714/Lakas-lists-down-30-senatorial-bets-for-2010--spokesman |date=2012-09-10 }}</ref>

====De Venecia resignation====
Former Speaker of the House [[Jose de Venecia Jr.]] (Pangasinan -4th District) resigned his post as president of Lakas-CMD on March 10, 2008; he rejected the proposition of former president [[Fidel Ramos]] to give him the title Chairman-emeritus. The current Speaker of the House [[Prospero Nograles]] (Davao -1st District) was sworn it as the new president of Lakas-CMD party and former Speaker of the house [[Feliciano Belmonte Jr.]] as vice president for Metro Manila affairs on the same day.

====Merger with KAMPI====
[[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on June 18, 2008, confirmed the historical [[merger]] of the Lakas-Christian-Muslim-Democrats (Lakas-CMD) and the [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (Kampi) parties. Both parties adopted the “equity of the incumbent” principle, as the merger will account for almost 200 national and 8,000 local officials, amid Mrs. Arroyo's prediction of  2010 elections victory. [[Prospero Nograles]], Lakas president and Kampi Chair [[Ronaldo Puno]] signed the covenant at the [[Davao City]] regional [[caucus]].<ref>[http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news4_june19_2008  manilastandardtoday.com,  Lakas, Kampi merge; see victory in 2010 polls]</ref><ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/101994/Lakas-CMD-Kampi-merge   GMA NEWS.TV,  Lakas-CMD, Kampi merge]</ref> Former President and Lakas-CMD Chairman Emeritus [[Fidel V.

On August 9, 2009, Pangasinan Representative and Former House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia Jr.]] and Former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] led fifty members from the Lakas Kampi CMD in objecting to its merger with [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI) on May 28, 2009. The faction made de Venecia its President with Ramos as the Chairman Emeritus of the new party, Ramos refused the offer of Chairman Emeritus of Lakas-Kampi after being named in interim party organization. De Venecia has filed a resolution at the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] to declare ''null and void'' the merger.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090909-224323/Lakas-Kampi-CMD-merger-in-peril Lakas-Kampi-CMD merger in peril] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162726/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090909-224323/Lakas-Kampi-CMD-merger-in-peril |date=2015-04-27 }}</ref> However, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] ultimately upheld the legality of the merger,<ref>http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideNation.htm?f=2010/january/1/nation3.isx&d=/2010/january/1</ref> citing the failure of de Venecia “to sufficiently show that any grave abuse of discretion was committed by the [[Commission on Elections]] in rendering the challenged resolution.”<ref>[https://archive.today/20120912094846/http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=537212&publicationSubCategoryId=63]</ref>
