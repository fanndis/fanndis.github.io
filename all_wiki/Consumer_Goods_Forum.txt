'''The Consumer Goods Forum''' (CGF) is a global, parity-based industry network, driven by its members. It brings together the CEOs and senior management of over 400 retailers, manufacturers, service providers and other stakeholders across 70 countries and reflects the diversity of the industry in geography, size, product category and format. Forum member companies have combined sales of EUR 2.5 trillion. Their retailer and manufacturer members directly employ nearly 10 million people with a further 90 million related jobs estimated along the value chain.<ref name="who">[http://www.theconsumergoodsforum.com/about.aspx Official website, Who We Are]</ref>  It is the only association in the consumer goods industry that is truly global, while embracing both retailers and manufacturers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The Consumer Goods Forum is governed by its board of directors, which includes 50 manufacturer and retailer CEOs and Chairpersons.<ref name="who"/>

The Forum’s vision is: “Better lives through better business”. To fulfil this, its members have given the Forum a mandate to develop common positions on key strategic and operational issues affecting the consumer goods business, with a strong focus on non-competitively sensitive process improvement. The Forum’s success is driven by the active participation of the key players in the sector, who together develop and lead the implementation of best practices along the value chain.<ref name="who"/>

With its headquarters in [[Paris]] and its regional offices in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]], and [[Tokyo]], the CGF serves its members throughout the world.<ref name="who"/>

==Overview==

The Forum provides a unique global platform for knowledge exchange and initiatives around four strategic pillars – sustainability, product safety, health and wellness and end-to-end value chain and standards – which are central to the advancement of today’s consumer goods industry.<ref name="who" /> The CGF's fifth focus area is Knowledge and Best Practice Sharing. Knowledge collectively created under the CGF umbrella is actively shared with CGF members, strategic alliances and other key stakeholders. This inspires further collaborative actions and participation in industry multi-stakeholder platforms.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The CGF is therefore acknowledged{{cn|date=September 2018}} as the focal point for both gathering and expressing the considered view of the consumer goods industry, and as the source of transparent and reasonable response to public concerns as they arise.

The CGF has produced a number of Board approved public resolutions and commitments within its four key pillars. These include commitments on Forced Labour, Deforestation, Refrigeration, Food Waste, Access & Availability of Products and Services, Product Information & Responsible Marketing, Communication & Education About Healthier Diets and Lifestyles, Food Safety and Consumer Engagement Principles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}
