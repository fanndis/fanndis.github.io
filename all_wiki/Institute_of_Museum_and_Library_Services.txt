The '''Institute of Museum and Library Services''' ('''IMLS''') is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency]] of the [[United States federal government]] established in 1996.  It is the main source of federal support for [[libraries]] and [[museums]] within the United States, having the mission to "create strong libraries and museums that connect people with information and ideas."<ref name="about">{{Cite news |url=http://www.imls.gov/about-us |title=About Us |date=2015-02-19 |newspaper=Institute of Museum and Library Services |access-date=2016-10-23 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916195520/http://www.imls.gov/about-us |archivedate=2015-09-16 }}</ref> IMLS "works at the national level and in coordination with state and local organizations to sustain heritage, culture, and knowledge; enhance learning and innovation; and support professional development." Their vision is "a democratic society where communities and individuals thrive with broad public access to knowledge, cultural heritage, and lifelong learning."<ref name="about"/> In fiscal year 2015, IMLS had a budget of $228 million.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.imls.gov/imls-admin/budget-and-performance |title=Budget and Performance |newspaper=Institute of Museum and Library Services |access-date=2016-10-23 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024093345/https://www.imls.gov/imls-admin/budget-and-performance |archivedate=2016-10-24 }}</ref>

In addition to its other responsibilities, the IMLS annually awards the [[National Medal for Museum and Library Service]], the nation's highest award given for community service by libraries and museums.

IMLS is located at 955 L'Enfant Plaza North, SW, Suite 4000, Washington, D.C.  20024-2135.

==History==
IMLS was established by the Museum and Library Services Act (MLSA) on September 30, 1996, which includes the [[Library Services and Technology Act]] and the Museum Services Act. This act was reauthorized in 2003 and again in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.imls.gov/about-us/legislation-budget/timeline |title=Timeline |date=2015-02-19 |newspaper=Institute of Museum and Library Services |access-date=2016-10-23 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024093451/https://www.imls.gov/about-us/legislation-budget/timeline |archivedate=2016-10-24 }}</ref> The law combined the [[Institute of Museum Services]], which had been in existence since 1976, and the Library Programs Office, which had been part of the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] since 1956.  Lawmakers at that time saw "great potential in an Institute that is focused on the combined roles that libraries and museums play in our community life."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imls.gov/imlsat20 |title=IMLS At 20 |website=IMLS History |access-date=October 17, 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012191236/https://www.imls.gov/imlsat20 |archivedate=October 12, 2016 }}</ref>

As amended, MLSA authorizes IMLS to promote improvements in library services; to facilitate access to resources in libraries; to encourage resource sharing among libraries; to support museums in fulfilling their public service and educational roles; to encourage leadership and innovation to enhance museum services; to assist museums in the conservation of America's heritage; to support museums in achieving the highest standards of management and service to the public; and to support resource sharing among museums, libraries and other organizations. MLSA also authorizes IMLS to carry out and publish analyses of the impact of museum and library services.<ref name="about"/>

The act comes up for reauthorization every 5 years. Adjustment to the act have been made over time.<ref>Mjoseth, Jeaninne, Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences, 3rd ed, "Institute of Museum and Library Services", Aug 25, 2011</ref>

In April 2014, Representative [[Paul Ryan]] (R-WI) recommended that the federal government not fund MLSA and "shift the federal agency’s responsibilities to the private sector in his 2015 fiscal year budget resolution"<ref name="House budget proposal dismisses role of IMLS">{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/news/node/10177 |title=House budget proposal dismisses role of IMLS |publisher=American Library Association |date=1 April 2014 |accessdate=8 April 2014 |author=Wright, Jazzy |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410020143/http://www.ala.org/news/node/10177 |archivedate=10 April 2014 }}</ref> such as "funded at the state and local level and augmented significantly by charitable contributions from the private sector".<ref name="The Path to Prosperity">{{cite web|url=http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fy15_blueprint.pdf |title=The Path to Prosperity |publisher=House Budget Committee |date=April 2014 |accessdate=8 April 2014 |author=Paul Ryan |page=51 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424174807/http://budget.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fy15_blueprint.pdf |archivedate=24 April 2014 }}</ref>

==Consolidation==
Following a proposal by President [[George W. Bush]], the activities of the [[National Commission on Libraries and Information Science]] was consolidated under IMLS, along with some of the activities of the [[National Center for Education Statistics]], in order to create a unified body for federal support of library and information policy.<ref>”IMLS Gets Feedback on NCLIS Consolidation”, “American Libraries”, 8(8):  8.</ref>  The consolidation took effect in early 2008.

== Leadership ==
When Congress passed the Library Services and Technology Act in 1996, it moved library responsibilities out of the Department of Education and created the IMLS as new agency. The act stipulated that the agency maintain a rotating directorship starting with the former director of the Institute of Museum Services for a four-year term. In the fifth year, the directorship would pass to a representative from the field of library and information science.
