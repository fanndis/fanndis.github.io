The '''Embassy of Russia in [[Oslo]]''' is the [[List of diplomatic missions of Russia|diplomatic mission of Russia]] to [[Norway]]. The embassy is located at [[Skarpsno]]. The current ambassador is [[Sergey Vadimovich Andreyev]].

== History ==
The oldest building on the lot is a house built in 1867 for Colonel [[F.P.L. Næser]] by architect [[Wilhelm von Hanno]]. From 1926, the house was the residence of German minister [[Edmund Rohmberg]], and later by [[Curt Bräuer]]. The building closest to [[Drammensveien]], was built by the Germans in 1926, and drawn by [[Oscar Hoff]]. After the conclusion of [[World War II]], the building was seized by the Norwegian government and made available for the [[Soviet Union]].

== The Embassy building ==
The complex of buildings of the Russian Embassy is located on an area of 11.5 hectares and since 1946, it is on an indefinite rent.<ref name="о">{{cite web

Since 1924, started the history of the complex of buildings of the diplomatic mission of Russia in Norway, when diplomatic relations were established between the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and Norway. It was the time when  the premises located in a house on 22A, Incognitogata Street, were allocated to the needs of the USSR Embassy.

In June 1940, Norway was occupied by [[Nazi Germany|fascist Germany]] and diplomatic relations with the USSR were interrupted.

After the end of the [[World War II]] in 1946, the [[Diplomatic mission|diplomatic]] relations at the embassy level were restored and two buildings along Drammensween Street 74 were allocated for the premises of the USSR Embassy. Before that, the diplomatic representation of Germany was located in these buildings for 20 years.<ref name="о" />

One of the buildings, a mansion with an area of 0.9 thousand m², was designed in the middle of the 19th century by the famous German architect Wilhelm von Hanno, commissioned by the State General and Marshal of the royal court Frederic Neser. In 1885, the house was bought by Norwegian W. E. Kier, one of the five sons of a wealthy timber merchant H. Kiera,  and was inherited for 40 years. The interior of the building, despite a series of rearrangements, was largely preserved in its original form. Currently, the Embassy’s protocol events are held in this building.
