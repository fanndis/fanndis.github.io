'''''The Local''''' is a multi-regional, European, English-language digital news publisher with local editions in [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and [[Switzerland]]. Each site, while alike in appearance, has separate editorial teams, each focused on its respective market.<ref>[https://www.thelocal.se/aboutus The Local:About us]</ref>

Coverage is purely domestic in each country, and includes current events, politics, business, sports and culture, as well as analysis and opinion.

The parent company The Local Europe AB, headquartered in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, also owns English-language discussion forums in Germany ([[Toytown Germany]]) and Switzerland (English Forum).<ref name="Imprint">{{cite web|url=http://www.toytowngermany.com/xtra/pages/imprint.html|title=Toytown Germany Imprint|publisher=Toytown Germany|accessdate=15 October 2013}}</ref>
