The '''Committee on Capital Markets Regulation''' is an independent and [[nonpartisan]] [[501(c)(3)]] research organization financed by contributions from individuals, foundations, and corporations.

==Background==
Thirty-six leaders from the financial sector, including [[bank]]s, [[Brokerage_firm|broker-dealers]], asset managers, [[Private_equity_fund|private funds]], [[insurance]] companies, and [[academia]] comprise the Committee's membership. The Committee co-Chairs are [[Glenn Hubbard (economics)|Glenn Hubbard]], Dean of [[Columbia Business School]], and [[John L. Thornton]], Chairman of the [[Brookings Institution]].  The Committee’s Director is Professor [[Hal S. Scott]], Emeritus Nomura Professor and Director of the Program on International Financial Systems at [[Harvard Law School]]. The Committee's research regarding the regulation of U.S. capital markets provides policymakers with a nonpartisan, empirical foundation for public policy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Ian|title=U.S. Financial Regulations Need Overhaul, Panel Says|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aHKD17tURbfk&refer=news|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107013730/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aHKD17tURbfk&refer=news|archive-date=7 November 2015}}</ref>

==History==
The Committee was founded in 2006 by then-[[United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Henry Paulson]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Newburger|first=Emily|title=Committee on Capital Markets Regulation offers students the chance to whisper in the Treasury secretary’s ear|url=https://today.law.harvard.edu/connecting-about-interconnectedness-committee-on-capital-markets-regulation-offers-students-the-chance-to-whisper-in-the-treasury-secretarys-ear/|access-date=8 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711084456/https://today.law.harvard.edu/connecting-about-interconnectedness-committee-on-capital-markets-regulation-offers-students-the-chance-to-whisper-in-the-treasury-secretarys-ear/|archive-date=11 July 2017}}

===Past Recommendations===

====The Global Financial Crisis: A Plan for Regulatory Reform====
In 2009, the Committee determined four critical objectives based upon a year of observation and research into the [[Financial_crisis_of_2007–2008|financial crisis]] that are further broken down into 57 specific recommendations.<ref>{{cite web|date=26 May 2009|title=Committee on Capital Markets Regulation Releases The Global Financial Crisis|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/entertainment/1694771/committee_on_capital_markets_regulation_releases_the_global_financial_crisis/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403135945/https://www.redorbit.com/news/entertainment/1694771/committee_on_capital_markets_regulation_releases_the_global_financial_crisis/|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref>  These four objectives are:
#  Reduced systemic risk through more sensible and effective regulation.
#  Increased disclosure to protect investors and stabilize the market.
#  A unified regulatory system where lines of accountability are clear and transparency in improved.
#  International regulatory harmonization and cooperation.

====A Blueprint for Financial Reform====
In 2010, within a 37-page letter to [[Chris Dodd|Chairman Dodd]], [[Richard Shelby|Ranking Member Shelby]], [[Blanche Lincoln|Chairman Lincoln]] and [[Saxby Chambliss|Ranking Member Chambliss]], the CCMR evaluated all major elements in the financial reform proposals that have emerged from [[United States congressional committee#Senate committees|Senate committees]], but focused especially on four as areas for compromise:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2010/05/06/capital-markets-committee-proposes-blueprint-for-compromise-on-financial-reform/|title=Capital Markets Committee Proposes Blueprint for Compromise on Financial Reform|date=2010-05-26|accessdate=2018-11-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108164011/https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2010/05/06/capital-markets-committee-proposes-blueprint-for-compromise-on-financial-reform/|archivedate=2018-11-08}}</ref>
# Federal regulators must have the ability to use tax dollars (and recoup them later) to pay for the orderly resolution of failing institutions in cases where they judge the alternative would be national and/or international financial catastrophe.
# No banks or non-banks should be labeled “systemically important.”
# Clarity about jurisdiction over the clearing and settlement of derivatives is crucial to reducing systemic risk, as is increasing these activities.
# The proposed independent and transparently funded Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) should be free of overriding authority except that of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (as provided in the [[Wall Street reform#Dodd bill|Dodd Bill]]) and the [[Treasury Secretary]] (only when he or she is acting on matters of the “safety and soundness” of the financial system, as in matters of [[systemic risk]]).

====A Balanced Approach to Cost-Benefit Analysis Reform====
Released in October 2013, the Committee’s position paper set forth a balanced approach to strengthening [[cost-benefit analysis]] requirements applicable to the independent agencies tasked with implementing regulatory reform in the U.S. financial system. The Committee outlined an approach it believed would maximize the economic efficiency of the U.S. regulatory system, minimize procedural burdens on regulators, and help insulate new rulemakings from judicial challenge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.capmktsreg.org/2013/10/01/a-balanced-approach-to-cost-benefit-analysis-reform/ |title=A Balanced Approach to Cost-Benefit Analysis Reform |date=2013-10-01 |accessdate=2019-06-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190610155222/https://www.capmktsreg.org/2013/10/01/a-balanced-approach-to-cost-benefit-analysis-reform/ |archivedate=2019-06-10 }}</ref>

====The U.S. Equity Markets: A Plan for Regulatory Reform====
In July 2016, the Committee's “The U.S. Equity Markets: A Plan for Regulatory Reform” sought to inform the public and policymakers about the U.S. equity market structure and evaluate its performance for U.S. investors and public companies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.capmktsreg.org/2016/07/26/the-u-s-equity-markets-a-plan-for-regulatory-reform/ |title=The U.S. Equity Markets: A Plan for Regulatory Reform |date=2016-07-26 |accessdate=2019-06-10 }}</ref> The report set forth 24 recommendations that fell into three categories:
# Increasing the transparency of U.S. equity markets
# Strengthening the resilience of U.S. equity markets
# Reducing transaction costs by enhancing [[Competition_(economics)|competition]]

===Recent Proposals===

====Roadmap for Regulatory Reform====
In May 2017, the Committee's “Roadmap for Regulatory Reform” set forth priority regulatory actions for the [[Presidency_of_Donald_Trump|Trump administration]] that would promote U.S. economic growth and enhance the stability of the U.S. financial system. The Roadmap consisted of eleven recommendation areas:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.capmktsreg.org/2017/05/16/roadmap-for-regulatory-reform/ |title=Roadmap for Regulatory Reform |date=2017-05-16 |accessdate=2019-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312233829/http://www.capmktsreg.org/2017/05/16/roadmap-for-regulatory-reform/ |archivedate=2018-03-12 }}</ref>
# Conducting a cumulative assessment of regulatory impact
# Enhancing the U.S. approach to international regulatory frameworks
# Reexamining [[Capital_requirement|bank capital and liquidity requirements]]
# Reducing undue regulatory burdens on [[community bank]]s and [[regional bank]]s
# Simplifying and streamlining the [[Volcker Rule]]
# Ensuring that rulemakings are adopted through a transparent and public process
# Enhancing the process of identifying and addressing systemic risk
# Establishing a rule of law framework for the [[Federal Reserve]] as a lender of last resort
# Reinvigorating the stagnant U.S. [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]] market
# Reforming trading rules for the U.S. [[stock market]]
# Reviewing the U.S. public enforcement regime

====Rationalizing Enforcement in the U.S. Financial System====
In June 2018, the staff of the Committee developed a comprehensive overview of the structure, operation, and transparency of the U.S. public enforcement system as it pertains to the financial system.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.capmktsreg.org/2018/06/14/committee-staff-releases-report-on-the-u-s-public-enforcement-system/ |title=Committee Staff Releases Report on the U.S. Public Enforcement System |date=2018-06-14 |accessdate=2019-06-10}}</ref> The staff set forth recommendations in four major areas:
# Improving coordination and cooperation between enforcement authorities
# Rationalizing the setting of sanctions in enforcement actions
# Ensuring the appropriate use of monetary sanctions
# Promoting individual accountability

====Expanding Opportunities for Investors and Retirees: Private Equity====
In October 2018, the Committee found that [[Private_equity#Investments_in_private_equity|private equity funds]] have a well-established performance history that justifies expanding access to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://middlemarketgrowth.org/research-committee-advocates-increased-private-equity-investment/|title=New Research Supports Expansion of Private Equity Investment Opportunities|date=2018-11-15|accessdate=2019-06-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190610150207/https://middlemarketgrowth.org/research-committee-advocates-increased-private-equity-investment/|archivedate=2019-06-10}}</ref> It recommends three ways to do so:
# Legislative reforms to expand access to direct investments in private equity funds
# [[Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] reforms to expand access to public closed-end funds that invest in private equity funds
# [[Department of Labor]] reforms to facilitate the ability of [[401(k)]] plans to offer investment options that provide exposure to private equity funds.
