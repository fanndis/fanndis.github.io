'''Slack''' is a proprietary business communication platform developed by American software company [[Slack Technologies]]. Slack offers many [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]-style features, including persistent chat rooms (channels) organized by topic, private groups, and direct messaging.

==History==
Slack began as an internal tool for [[Stewart Butterfield]]'s company [[Slack Technologies|Tiny Speck]] during the development of ''[[Glitch (video game)|Glitch]]'', an online game.<ref name="Tam">{{Cite web |title=Flickr founder plans to kill company e-mails with Slack |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/flickr-founder-plans-to-kill-company-e-mails-with-slack/ |last=Tam |first=Donna |access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref> Slack launched in August 2013.<ref name=Koetsier />

In March 2015, Slack announced it had been [[Exploit (computer security)|hacked]] over four days in February 2015, and that some data associated with user accounts had been compromised, including email addresses, usernames, hashed passwords, phone numbers, and [[Skype]] IDs. In response to the attacks, Slack added [[Multi-factor authentication|two-factor authentication]] to its service.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Greenberg |first1=Andy |title=Slack Says It Was Hacked, Enables Two-Factor Authentication |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/slack-admits-hacked-enables-2-factor-authentication/ |website=Wired.com |publisher=Condé Nast |access-date=October 13, 2018 |date=March 27, 2015}}</ref>

Slack was previously compatible with non-proprietary [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC) and [[XMPP]] messaging protocols, but the company closed the corresponding gateways in May 2018.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/03/09/slack_cuts_ties_to_irc_and_xmpp/ |title=Slack cuts ties to IRC and XMPP, cos they don't speak Emoji |date=March 9, 2018 |last=Sharwood |first=Simon |access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref>

"Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge" is a [[backronym]] for "Slack".<ref name="Acronym">{{Cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/where-did-slack-get-its-name-2016-9 |title=Slack, the red hot $3.8 billion startup, has a hidden meaning behind its name |last=Kim |first=Eugene |date=September 27, 2016 |work=UK Business Insider |access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref>

On April 26, 2019, Slack went public without an IPO and saw its shares soar to $21 billion valuation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Slack soars to $21 billion valuation in debut after shunning IPO |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/slack-soars-to-21-billion-valuation-in-debut-after-shunning-ipo/articleshow/69881406.cms?from=mdr |publisher=Economic Times |accessdate=19 February 2020 |language=en |date=20 June 2019}}</ref>

==Features==
Slack offers many [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]-style features, including persistent chat rooms (channels) organized by topic, private groups, and direct messaging.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Heather A.|date=January 2018|title=Slack|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association|volume=106|issue=1|pages=148–151|doi=10.5195/jmla.2018.315|issn=1536-5050|pmc=5764588}}</ref> Content, including files, conversations, and people, is all searchable within Slack. Users can add [[emoji]] buttons to their messages, on which other users can then click to express their reactions to messages.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Slack Adds Emoji Reactions |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/09/slack-adds-emoji-reactions/ |first=Jordan |last=Crook |date=July 9, 2015 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Slack updated their privacy policy: Now your company can read 'private' messages|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/better/business/slack-updates-privacy-policy-employers-can-read-private-dms-without-ncna862811|access-date=2020-06-09|website=NBC News|language=en}}</ref>

Slack's free plan allows only the 10,000 most recent messages to be viewed and searched.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gebhart|first=Gennie|date=2019-07-01|title=Opinion {{!}} What if All Your Slack Chats Were Leaked?|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/opinion/slack-chat-hackers-encryption.html|access-date=2020-06-09|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

===Teams===
Slack teams allow communities, groups, or teams to join a "workspace" via a specific URL or invitation sent by a team admin or owner.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Witman|first=Emma|title=How to reset your Slack password in 2 different ways|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-reset-slack-password|access-date=2020-06-09|website=Business Insider}}</ref> Although Slack was developed for professional and organizational communication, it has been adopted as a community platform, replacing message boards or social media groups.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=Locke|first=Charley|date=2016-06-09|title=Finally, Slack Is Living Up to Its Name|work=Wired|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/06/slack-social-network/|access-date=2020-06-09|issn=1059-1028}}</ref>

===Messaging===
Public channels allow team members to communicate without the use of email or group [[SMS]] (texting). Public channels are open to everyone in the workspace.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=John|first=Steven|title=How to join a Slack channel on desktop or mobile, whether it's public or private|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-join-a-slack-channel|access-date=2020-06-09|website=Business Insider}}</ref>

Private channels allow for private conversation between smaller sub-groups. These private channels can be used to organize large teams.<ref name=":3" />

Direct messages allow users to send private messages to specific users rather than a group of people. Direct messages can include up to nine people. Once started, a direct message group can be converted into a private channel.<ref name=":1" />

===Integrations===
Slack integrates with many third-party services and supports community-built integrations, including [[Google Drive]], [[Trello]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Box (company)|Box]], [[Heroku]], [[IBM]] [[Bluemix]], [[Crashlytics]], [[GitHub]], [[Runscope]], [[Zendesk]]<ref name="Gannes">{{Cite web |title=Flickr Co-Founder Stewart Butterfield Turns to Workplace Communication Tools With Slack |url=http://allthingsd.com/20130814/flickr-co-founder-stewart-butterfield-turns-to-workplace-communication-tools-with-slack/ |last=Gannes |first=Liz |date=August 14, 2013 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Augustine">{{Cite web |title=A Review of the Slack Communication Service |url=https://www.lifewire.com/slack-sets-standard-team-communication-online-771603 |last=Augustine |first=Ann |date=May 19, 2018 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref> and [[Zapier]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://zapier.com/apps/integrations |title=Zapier {{!}} The easiest way to automate your work |website=Zapier.com |access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref> In December 2015, Slack launched their [[Application software|software application]] ("app") directory, consisting of over 150 integrations that users can install.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Slack launches an app store and an $80 million fund to invest in new integrations |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/15/10235114/slack-app-directory-80-million-fund |date=December 15, 2015 |first=Casey |last=Newton |website=TheVerge.com |access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref>

==Business model==
Slack is a [[freemium]] product, whose main paid features are the ability to search more than 10,000 archived messages and add unlimited apps and integrations. They claim support for an unlimited number of users. When [[freeCodeCamp]] attempted to switch its community of over 8,000 users to Slack in 2015, however, they experienced many technical issues and were advised by Slack support to limit their channels to "no more than 1,000 users (ideally more like 500)".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/so-yeah-we-tried-slack-and-we-deeply-regretted-it-391bcc714c81 |title=So Yeah We Tried Slack... and We Deeply Regretted It |publisher=FreeCodeCamp.com |date=June 21, 2015 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-free-unlimited-plan-has-limits-2015-6 |title=Startup founder claims $2.8 billion startup Slack is misleading people about its free 'unlimited' plan |first=Eugene |last=Kim |publisher=BusinessInsider.com |date=June 22, 2015 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref> That specific limit no longer applied by January 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://davechen.net/2017/01/slack-user-limit/ |title=Despite its marketing, Slack's free tier limits your total number of users |publisher=DaveChen.net |first=Dave |last=Chen |date=January 20, 2017 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref>

On July 26, 2018, [[Atlassian]] announced the shutdown of its competing [[HipChat]] and [[Stride (software)|Stride]], effective February 11, 2019, and the sale of their intellectual property to Slack, with Slack to assume the user bases of the services.
