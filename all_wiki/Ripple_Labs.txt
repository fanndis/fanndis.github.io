'''Ripple Labs, Inc.''' is an [[United States|American]] [[technology company]] which develops the [[Ripple (payment protocol)|Ripple payment protocol]] and exchange network. Originally named Opencoin and renamed '''Ripple Labs''' in 2015, the company was founded in 2012 and is based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].<ref name="CompanyOverview">{{Cite web |title=Company Overview of Ripple Labs Inc. |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=235707311 |access-date=18 March 2014 |publisher=BusinessWeek}}</ref>

==History==
Ryan Fugger conceived Ripple in 2004 after working on a [[local exchange trading system]] in [[Vancouver]]. The intent was to create a monetary system that was decentralized and could effectively empower individuals and communities to create their own money. Fugger later built the first iteration of this system, [[Ripple (payment protocol)|RipplePay.com]]. Concurrently, in May 2011, [[Jed McCaleb]] began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by [[Bitcoin]]. In August 2012, [[Jed McCaleb]] hired [[Chris Larsen]] and they approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency idea. After discussions with McCaleb and long-standing members of the Ripple community, Fugger handed over the reins. In September 2012, Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb co-founded the corporation OpenCoin.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Reutzel |first=Bailey |title=Disruptor Chris Larsen Returns with a Bitcoin-Like Payments System |url=http://www.paymentssource.com/news/disruptor-chris-larsen-returns-with-bitcoin-like-payments-system-3012580-1.html?zkPrintable=1&nopagination=1 |access-date=18 March 2014 |publisher=PaymentSource}}</ref>

OpenCoin began development of the ripple protocol ([[Ripple (payment protocol)|RTXP]]) and the Ripple payment and exchange network. On April 11, 2013, OpenCoin announced it had closed an angel round of funding with several venture capital firms. That same month, OpenCoin acquired SimpleHoney to help it popularize virtual currencies and make them easier for average users.<ref name=BetterBitcoin /> 

On September 26, 2013, OpenCoin officially changed its name to Ripple Labs, Inc.<ref name=CompanyOverview /> 

On May 5, 2015, Ripple received a {{US$|700,000|2015}} civil money penalty from U.S. Treasury's [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN) for “willful violation of the Bank Secrecy Act by acting as a money services business without registering with FinCEN.”<ref name="fine">{{Cite press release |title=FinCEN Fines Ripple Labs Inc. in First Civil Enforcement Action Against a Virtual Currency Exchanger |date=5 May 2015 |publisher=FinCEN |url=http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/nr/pdf/20150505.pdf |access-date=6 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512222302/http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/nr/pdf/20150505.pdf |archive-date=12 May 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> On October 6, 2015, the company was rebranded from Ripple Labs to Ripple.<ref name="aalecliu">{{Cite news |last=Liu |first=Alec |date=6 October 2015 |title=A New Chapter for Ripple |publisher=Ripple |url=https://ripple.com/blog/a-new-chapter-for-ripple/ |access-date=2015-10-22}}</ref>

In September 2017, R3 sued Ripple for specific performance of an option agreement in which Ripple agreed to sell up to five billion XRPs for a price of $.0085. Ripple countersued, claiming that R3 reneged on a number of contractual promises, and was simply acting in a spirit of opportunism, after the cryptocurrency increased in value more than 30 times. In September 2018, Ripple and R3 reached an undisclosed settlement agreement.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-09-10 |title=Ripple and R3 Reach Settlement |url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180910005908/en/Ripple-R3-Reach-Settlement |access-date=2019-04-01 |website=www.businesswire.com |language=en}}</ref>

==Awards and recognitions==
For its creation and development of the ripple protocol (RTXP) and the Ripple payment/exchange network, the magazine ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'' recognized Ripple Labs as one of 2014s 50 Smartest Companies in its February 2014 issue.

Ripple Labs agreed to remedial steps to ensure future compliance, which included an agreement to only transact XRP and "Ripple Trade" activity through registered [[money services business]]es (MSB), among other agreements such as enhancing the Ripple Protocol.<ref name="fincenfines" /> It has been argued that the changes made to the protocol did not change the protocol itself, but instead added AML transaction monitoring to the network and improve transaction analysis.<ref name="nrpl" /> However the FinCen statement clearly indicated that Ripple itself was making changes to the protocol as a result of the enforcement action. "Ripple Labs will also undertake certain enhancements to the Ripple Protocol to appropriately monitor all future transactions."<ref name=":0" />

Ripple executives, including CTO David Schwartz, have admitted the software that is sold to banks for payments processing, XCurrent, is not a blockchain or any form of distributed ledger. Schwartz described it as “bi-directional messaging” that can eventually plug into distributed ledgers, but xCurrent’s technology itself “is not a distributed ledger.”<ref>{{Cite web |title=Banks unlikely to process payments with distributed ledgers for now, says Ripple |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-blockchain-ripple/banks-unlikely-to-process-payments-with-distributed-ledgers-for-now-says-ripple-idUKKBN1J92JG |access-date=28 July 2019}}</ref>

In May 2018, Stewart Hosie MP, at a UK parliamentary inquiry into digital currencies, questioned Ryan Zagone of Ripple about the value and nature of the XRP Cryptocurrency: "...but the point that was made earlier, Mr Zagone, is that if people buy XRP—a financial asset—from Ripple Labs, it does not entitle them to an ownership stake, there is no right to be converted back into conventional currencies and it does not pay any return. It also seemingly has no purpose. Is that simply to avoid XRP looking like a security or an equity, and to avoid the necessary regulation?" <ref>{{Cite web |title=Treasury Committee Questioning of Ripple |url=http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/treasury-committee/digital-currencies/oral/82323.html |access-date=27 July 2019}}</ref>

Ripple claims to be completely separate from and have no control over the XRP cryptocurrency, in spite of the FinCen press release describing XRP as "its virtual currency, known as XRP".<ref name=":0" /> However Ripple controls the vast majority of the supply of XRP<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ripple XRP Holdings |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/why-ripple-is-not-cashing-out-its-xrp-holdings.html |access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref> and, according to its own published records, earns the majority of its income from selling XRP.
