==Finances==
Like other Texas public school districts, AISD is funded through a combination of local [[property tax]]es, general state revenues (such as [[occupation tax]]es, [[Texas Lottery]] profits, and returns from the [[Permanent School Fund]]), and federal education funds.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Introduction to School Finance in Texas|date=January 2012|website=Texas Taxpayers and Research Association|url=http://www.ttara.org/files/document/file-4f1732f763446.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=March 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319010947/http://www.ttara.org/files/document/file-4f1732f763446.pdf|archive-date=March 19, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The district also funds some facilities construction and improvements through the issuance of debt by bond elections; AISD's most recent bond election was in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Voters approve half of AISD’s $892 million bond proposals|last=Price|first=Asher|last2=Taboada|first2=Melissa B.|date=11 May 2013|newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/all-four-of-aisds-propositions-for-892-million-bon/nXpL6/|accessdate=March 26, 2015}}</ref>

On November 18, 2019 the AISD board of Trustees voted 6-3 in favor of a plan closing four elementary schools. This vote was critizied by many, including AISD Chief Equity Officer, Dr. Hawley who stated that the "map that you have of the closures is a map of what 21st century racism looks like. ... Our process for selecting schools was flawed. It was inequitable." The six Trustees who voted to close the schools were Cindy Anderson, Amber Elenz, Geronimo Rodriguez, Jayme Mathias, Yasmin Wagner and Kristen Ashy.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Barbaro|first=Nick|last2=Fri.|last3=Nov. 22|last4=2019|title=Public Notice: A Map of 21st Century Racism|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2019-11-22/public-notice-a-map-of-21st-century-racism/|access-date=2020-06-27|website=www.austinchronicle.com|language=en-US}}</ref>
