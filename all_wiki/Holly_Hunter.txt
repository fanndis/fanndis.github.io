She eventually moved to New York City and roomed with fellow actress [[Frances McDormand]]. Hunter, in 2008, described living in [[the Bronx]] "at the end of the D [subway] train, just off 205th Street, on Bainbridge Avenue and Hull Avenue. It was very Irish, and then you could go just a few blocks away and hit major Italian."<ref name="newsday">{{cite web|url=https://docslide.net/documents/newsday-fast-chat-holly-hunter.html|title=Fast Chat: Holly Hunter|publisher=Newsday|date=July 13, 2008|access-date=August 13, 2018}}</ref> A chance encounter with playwright [[Beth Henley]], when the two were trapped alone in an elevator, led to Hunter's being cast in Henley's plays ''[[Crimes of the Heart]]'' (succeeding [[Mary Beth Hurt]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]), and [[Off-Broadway]]'s ''[[The Miss Firecracker Contest]]''. "It was like the beginning of 1982. It was on 49th Street between Broadway and Eighth [Avenue] ... on the south side of the street," Hunter recalled in an interview. "[We were trapped] 10 minutes; not long. We actually had a nice conversation. It was just the two of us."<ref name="newsday" />

That year, she had her first collaboration with the writing-directing-producing team of brothers [[Ethan Coen]] and [[Joel Coen]], in ''[[Blood Simple]]'', making an uncredited appearance as a voice on an answering-machine recording.
