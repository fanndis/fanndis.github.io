The '''WGBH Educational Foundation,''' also known since August 2020 as simply '''GBH''', is a [[Boston]]-based [[public broadcasting]] group. Established in 1951, it operates all of the [[PBS]] [[network affiliate#Member stations|member stations]] in [[Massachusetts]], including its [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] [[WGBH-TV]], sister station [[WGBX-TV]], and [[WGBY-TV]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]].

Nationally, WGBH is known as the distributor of a number of major PBS programs, including ''[[American Experience]]'', ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'', ''[[Frontline (American TV program)|Frontline]]'', ''[[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece]]'', and ''[[Nova (American TV program)|Nova]]'' among others, the owner of [[Public Radio International]] — a syndicate of public radio programming, and for its role in the development of [[closed captioning]] and [[audio description]] technologies for broadcast television.

{{recentism|section|date=August 2018}}

{{Main|WGBH-TV#History}}

In 2003, WGBH and the City of Boston formed a joint venture for Boston Kids & Family TV channel that replaces one of the city's cable access channels. Boston Kids was launched on October 31, 2003.<ref name="bg">{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Suzanne C.|title=City revives kids' PBS channel|url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2003/10/31/city_revives_kids_pbs_channel/|accessdate=January 27, 2017|work=Boston Globe|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=October 31, 2003|language=en}}</ref>

By December 2005, Boston’s WGBH and New York City's [[WNET]] were already broadcasting a local version of [[World (TV channel)|World]] on a subchannel.<ref>{{cite news|title=Knight Foundation backs launch planning for PBS's Public Square|url=http://23g9r82i3f1d2a63qz3akhv1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/archive-site/news/news0523publicsquare.shtml|accessdate=March 30, 2016|work=Current|date=December 19, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426134453/http://23g9r82i3f1d2a63qz3akhv1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/archive-site/news/news0523publicsquare.shtml|archive-date=April 26, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and added by April 2006, Washington’s [[WETA-TV|WETA]]. Then, WGBH and WNET team up with PBS, APT and NETA to roll out a national version of the local channels as PBS World. The network was launched nationally on August 15, 2007.<ref name=crt>{{cite news |last1=Egner|first1=Jeremy |title=World and Go! streams flow into PBS plans |url= http://current.org/wp-content/uploads/archive-site/dtv/dtv0606multicast.shtml |accessdate=March 30, 2016|work=Current|date=April 3, 2006}}</ref>

In July 2012, WGBH acquired [[Public Radio International]] (PRI). PRI would continue with its own board while WGBH would be able to distribute more of its programs through PRI.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Everhart|first1=Karen|title=WGBH, the top producer of PBS programs, now owns Public Radio International|url=http://current.org/2012/07/wgbh-the-top-producer-of-pbs-programs-now-owns-public-radio-international/|accessdate=January 28, 2017|work=Current|date=July 26, 2012}}</ref>

In November 2015, WGBH purchased [[GlobalPost]], with editorial operation and reporting resources being merged with PRI's The World news staff.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yu|first1=Roger|title=Boston-based WGBH buys world news site GlobalPost|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/09/24/boston-based-wgbh-buys-world-news-site-globalpost/72729086/|accessdate=January 29, 2017|work=USA TODAY|date=September 24, 2015|language=en}}</ref>

In August 2020, it was announced that WGBH would rebrand on all platforms as "GBH", and also adopted purple as a new corporate color. The foundation cited that due to its present-day multi-platform operations, the full WGBH [[Call letters|call sign]] was too synonymous with broadcast media; "WGBH" will still be used as part of the organization's formal name.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wyllie|first=Julian|date=August 31, 2020|title=To change with the times, WGBH drops its 'W' and pivots to purple|url=https://current.org/2020/08/to-change-with-the-times-wgbh-drops-its-w-and-pivots-to-purple/|accessdate=August 31, 2020|work=[[Current (newspaper)|Current]]|quote=WGBH in Boston is removing the “W” from its branding to become “GBH.” [...] The legal name for the organization will remain the WGBH Education Foundation. The “W” will also remain in its FCC registration.}}</ref> [[WCAI]] radio also similarly rebranded as "CAI" on September 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=A New Name and a New Look|url=https://www.capeandislands.org/post/new-name-and-new-look|accessdate=September 2, 2020|publisher=WCAI|date=September 2, 2020}}</ref>
