== Origins and scale ==
Ukrainian professor {{ill|Oleh Bazaluk|uk|Базалук Олег Олександрович}} reports that the roots of the Ukrainian corruption stem from the Soviet nature of the Ukrainian political leaders, who used to be integrated into Communist nomenclature (ruling elite) before the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. The politicians created authoritarian-oligarchic governance regime in Ukraine where the corruption is ubiquitous and no chances to implement a European choice of the Ukrainian people.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bazaluk|first=Oleg|date=2016 |title= Corruption in Ukraine: Rulers' Mentality and the Destiny of the Nation|pages=XIV|chapter= Introduction|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=weH6DAAAQBAJ&q=education |isbn=9781443896894 }}</ref>

Prominent Ukrainian economist {{ill|Oleh Havrylyshyn|uk|Олег Гаврилишин}} performed a comparison of the Ukrainian corruption in wide global context based on data provided by [[Transparency International]].

===Corruption Perceptions Index ratings===
[[File:Корупція в Україні 1998-2018.jpg|thumb|300px|Corruption Perceptions Index ratings in Ukraine 1998-2018]]
[[Transparency International]] produces an annual report listing each country's [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] score.  This "score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people and country analysts and, through 2011, ranged between 10 (highly clean) and 0 (highly corrupt)."<ref name=CPI2006Table/> In the 2010 report, the least corrupt country listed was Denmark with a score of 9.3, and the most corrupt of the 178 countries listed was Somalia with a score of 1.1.<ref name=TPIAnnRep2010/>  From 2012 on, the scores were presented on a 0-100 scale.<ref name="2012-CPI-Table-Full-Data"/> In the 2016 report, Denmark was still the least corrupt country listed with a score of 90, and Somalia was still the most corrupt of the 176 countries listed, with a score of 10.  By comparison, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom tied as 10th least corrupt countries with a score of 81, and the United States was 18th least corrupt with a score of 74.<ref name=2016CPI/>

The following table lists Ukraine's place in the Corruption Perceptions Index table, based on Transparency International's annual reports from 1999 onward. The methods used in assessing the Index change from year to year, so comparisons between years are difficult.

In 2014's [[Transparency International]] [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] Ukraine was ranked 142nd out of the 175 countries investigated (tied with [[Uganda]] and [[the Comoros]]).<ref name="en.interfax.com.ua"/>
Note: For 1999 and 2000, the data were listed as 1998 and 1999 respectively.  From 2001, the data listed are stated to be for the year of the annual report.  Up to 2005, the annual report included some measures of the uncertainty of the index scores; these data were omitted from the annual reports from 2006 onwards, but were contained in the CPI report.

===Public Perception of Corruption in Institutions of Ukraine===
The following table shows average scores from a survey of Ukrainian public perception of corruption in Ukraine's institutions. Comparable figures for the United Kingdom and the United States from surveys for 2009 (for British and American people's perception of corruption in their own countries) are shown at the bottom of the table.
