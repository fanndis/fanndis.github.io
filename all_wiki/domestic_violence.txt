'''Domestic violence''' (also named '''domestic abuse''' or '''family violence''') is [[violence]] or other [[abuse]] in a domestic setting, such as in [[marriage]] or [[cohabitation]]. ''Domestic violence'' is often used as a [[synonym]] for ''[[intimate partner violence]]'', which is committed by a [[spouse]] or partner in an [[intimate relationship]] against the other spouse or partner, and can take place in [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or [[Domestic violence in same-sex relationships|same-sex]] relationships, or between former spouses or partners. In its broadest sense, domestic violence also involves violence against children, teenagers, parents, or the elderly. It takes a number of forms, including [[physical abuse|physical]], [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[emotional abuse|emotional]], [[economic abuse|economic]], [[Religious abuse|religious]], [[Reproductive coercion|reproductive]], and [[sexual abuse]], which can range from subtle, coercive forms to [[marital rape]] and to violent physical abuse such as choking, beating, [[female genital mutilation]], and [[acid throwing]] that results in [[disfigurement]] or death. Domestic murders include [[stoning]], [[bride burning]], [[honor killing]]s, and [[dowry death]]s (which sometimes involve non-cohabitating family members).

Globally, the victims of domestic violence are overwhelmingly women,<!-- NOTE: This is thoroughly supported by the literature, and has been the subject of extensive discussion.

Domestic violence often occurs when the abuser believes that abuse is an entitlement, acceptable, justified, or unlikely to be reported. It may produce an intergenerational [[cycle of abuse]] in children and other family members, who may feel that such violence is acceptable or condoned. Many people do not recognize themselves as abusers or victims because they may consider their experiences as family conflicts that got out of control.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10896-013-9555-4 |title=Stay with or Leave the Abuser?

Traditionally, domestic violence (DV) was mostly associated with physical violence. Terms such as ''wife abuse'', ''wife beating'', ''wife battering'', and ''battered woman'' were used, but have declined in popularity due to efforts to include unmarried partners, abuse other than physical, female perpetrators, and same-sex relationships.{{refn|Terms such wife abuse, wife beating, and battering are descriptive terms that have lost popularity recently for several reasons:

There has been increased attention given to specific forms of domestic violence, such as honor killings, dowry deaths, and forced marriages. India has, in recent decades, made efforts to curtail dowry violence: the [[Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005|Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act]] (PWDVA) was enacted in 2005, following years of advocacy and activism by the women's organizations.<ref>{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Confronting dowry-related violence in India: women at the center of justice | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2012/12/confronting-dowry-related-violence-in-india-women-at-the-center-of-justice | website = unwomen.org | publisher = [[UN Women]] | date = 24 December 2012 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141107103046/http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2012/12/confronting-dowry-related-violence-in-india-women-at-the-center-of-justice | archive-date = 7 November 2014 }}</ref> [[Crimes of passion]] in Latin America, a region which has a history of treating such killings with extreme leniency, have also come to international attention. In 2002, Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, argued that there are similarities between the dynamics of crimes of passion and honor killings, stating that: "crimes of passion have a similar dynamic [to honor killings] in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable".<ref>{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Thousands of women killed for family "honor" | url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html | work = [[National Geographic News]] | publisher = [[National Geographic Society]] | date = 28 October 2010 | access-date = 22 August 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151019011522/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html | archive-date = 19 October 2015 }}</ref>

Historically, children had few protections from violence by their parents, and in many parts of the world, this is still the case. For example, in Ancient Rome, a father could legally kill his children. Many cultures have allowed fathers to sell their children into [[slavery]].

Sherry Hamby states that sexual violence is often left out of measures of IPV. When sexual violence is accounted for, female perpetrators make up less than 10%.<ref name=":10" /> She says that males' self-reports of victimization are unreliable, as they consistently underreport their own violence perpetration,<ref name=":9">{{Cite journal|last=Hamby|first=S.|date=2009|title=The gender debate about intimate partner violence: solutions and dead ends |doi=10.1037/a0015066 |journal=Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy |volume=1|pages=24–34}}</ref><ref name=":8" /> and also that both men and women use IPV for [[coercive control]].<ref name=":9" /> Coercive control is when one person uses a variety of IPV tactics to control and dominate the other, with little empathy; victims often resist with physical violence.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/coercivecontrole0000star|title=Coercive Control: How Men Entrap Women in Personal Life|date=2009-03-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195384048|series=Interpersonal Violence|location=Oxford, New York|url-access=registration}}</ref> It is generally perpetrated by men against women, and is the most likely of the types to cause [[Traumatic bonding|trauma bonding]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Reid|first1=Joan|last2=Haskell|first2=Rachael|last3=Dillahunt-Aspillaga|first3=Christina|last4=Thor|first4=Jennifer|date=2013-01-01|title=Trauma Bonding and Interpersonal Violence|url=https://digital.usfsp.edu/fac_publications/198|journal=Psychology of Trauma}}</ref> and require medical services.<ref name="Marx">{{cite book|authors=John Marx, Ron Walls, Robert Hockberger|title=Rosen's Emergency Medicine – Concepts and Clinical Practice|publisher=[[Elsevier Health Sciences]]|isbn=978-1455749874|year=2013|page=875|access-date=March 1, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uggC0i_jXAsC&pg=PA875}}</ref><ref name="Emery">{{cite book|author=Robert E.

Researchers have also found significantly different outcomes for men and women in response to intimate partner violence. A 2012 review from the journal ''[[Psychology of Violence]]'' found that women suffered disproportionately as a result of intimate partner violence, especially in terms of injuries, fear, and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].<ref name=":12">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0026296 |title=Gender differences in intimate partner violence outcomes |journal=Psychology of Violence |volume=2 |pages=42–57 |year=2012 |last1=Caldwell |first1=Jennifer E |last2=Swan |first2=Suzanne C |last3=Woodbrown |first3=V.

They also stated if one examines who is physically harmed and how seriously, expresses more fear, and experiences subsequent psychological problems, domestic violence is significantly gendered toward women as victims.<ref name="Eugenio">{{Cite journal | last1=Esquivel-Santovena |first1=Esteban Eugenio | last2=Lambert | first2=Teri | last3=Hamel | first3=John | title = Partner abuse worldwide | journal = Partner Abuse | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1891/1946-6560.4.1.e14 |url =http://domesticviolenceresearch.org/pdf/PASK.Tables14.Revised.pdf| date = January 2013 }}</ref>

Laws on domestic violence vary by country. While it is generally outlawed in the [[Western world]], this is not the case in many [[developing countries]]. For instance, in 2010, the United Arab Emirates's Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks.<ref>{{cite news | last = CNN Wire Staff | title = Court in UAE says beating wife, child OK if no marks are left | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120325143850/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM%3AWORLD | archive-date = 25 March 2012 | url = https://articles.cnn.com/2010-10-19/world/uae.court.ruling_1_islamic-law-sharia-law-ruling?_s=PM:WORLD | website = cnn.com | publisher = CNN | date = 19 October 2010 | access-date = 24 January 2014 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The social acceptability of domestic violence also differs by country. While in most developed countries domestic violence is considered unacceptable by most people, in many regions of the world the views are different: according to a [[UNICEF]] survey, the percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is, for example: 90% in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Jordan]], 87% in [[Mali]], 86% in [[Guinea]] and [[Timor-Leste]], 81% in [[Laos]], 80% in [[Central African Republic]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Childinfo | title = Attitudes towards wife beating: percentage of women aged 15–49 who think that a husband/partner is justified in hitting or beating his wife/partner under certain circumstances | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140704112113/http://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php | archive-date = 4 July 2014 | url = https://www.childinfo.org/attitudes_data.php | website = childinfo.org | publisher = Childinfo: monitoring the situation of children and women | access-date = 8 September 2013 }}</ref> Refusing to submit to a husband's wishes is a common reason given for justification of violence in developing countries:<ref>{{cite web | title = Home page | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140214095207/http://www.measuredhs.com/ | archive-date = 14 February 2014 | url = https://www.measuredhs.com/ | publisher = Measure DHS (Demographic and Health Surveys): Quality information to plan, monitor and improve population, health, and nutrition programs | date = 4 April 2013 | access-date = 8 September 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref> for instance 62.4% of women in [[Tajikistan]] justify wife beating if the wife goes out without telling the husband; 68% if she argues with him; 47.9% if she refuses to have sex with him.<ref>{{cite book | last = State Committee on Statistics of the Republic of Takistan | title = Tajikistan multiple indicator cluster survey 2005, final report | publisher = State Committee on Statistics of the Republic of Takistan | url = http://www.childinfo.org/files/MICS3_Tajikistan_FinalReport_2005_Eng.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213608/http://www.childinfo.org/files/MICS3_Tajikistan_FinalReport_2005_Eng.pdf| url-status = dead| archive-date = 2015-09-23| location = Dushanbe, Tajikistan | date = 2007 }}</ref>

The [[United Nations]] [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women]] (1993) states that "[[violence against women]] is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which has led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men".<ref name="UN GA Res" /><ref>{{cite book | last = UNFPA | author-link = United Nations Population Fund | title = UNFPA strategy and framework for action to addressing gender-based violence 2008–2011 | url = http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/2009_add_gen_vio.pdf | publisher = United Nations Population Fund | location = New York | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780897149518 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://perma-archives.org/warc/20160112155127/http://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/2009_add_gen_vio.pdf | archive-date = 2016-01-12 }}</ref>

The [[Maputo Protocol]] adopted a broader definition, defining violence against women as: "all acts perpetrated against women which cause or could cause them physical, sexual, psychological, and economic harm, including the threat to take such acts; or to undertake the imposition of arbitrary restrictions on or deprivation of fundamental freedoms in private or public life in peacetime and during situations of armed conflicts or of war".<ref>{{cite web | last = ACHPR | author-link = African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights | title = Protocol to the African charter on human and peoples' rights on the rights of women in Africa | url = http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol/ | publisher = [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] | date = 11 July 2003 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151202092756/http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol | archive-date = 2 December 2015 }}</ref>

[[Femicide]] is usually defined as the sex-based killing of women or girls by men, although the exact definitions vary. Femicides often occur in the context of DV, such as honor killings or dowry killings. For statistical purposes, femicide is often defined as any killing of a woman.

While the general literature indicates that adolescent boys and girls engage in IPV at about equal rates, females are more likely to use less dangerous forms of physical violence (e.g. pushing, pinching, slapping, scratching or kicking), while males are more likely to punch, strangle, beat, burn, or threaten with weapons. Males are also more likely to use sexual aggression, although both genders are equally likely to pressure their partner into sexual activities. In addition, females are four times more likely to respond as having experienced rape and are more likely to suffer fatal injuries inflicted by their partner, or to need psychological help as a result of the abuse. Females are more likely to consider IPV a serious problem than are their male counterparts, who are more likely to disregard female-perpetrated IPV.<ref name="O'Donohue"/><ref name="Mitchell"/><ref name=Poet>{{cite book | last1 = Poet | first1 = Andrea | last2 = Swiderski | first2 = Catherine R. | last3 = McHugh | first3 = Maureen C. | chapter = Developing teen relationships: the role of violence |chapter-url={{Google books|FGBTZmdGudcC|page=221|plainurl=yes}} | editor-last = Paludi | editor-first = Michele A. | title = The psychology of teen violence and victimization, volume 1, Part III.

There is a strong link between domestic violence and child abuse. Since domestic violence is a pattern of behavior, these incidences may increase in severity and frequency, resulting in an increased probability the children themselves will become victims. The estimated overlap between domestic violence and child abuse ranges from 30 to 50 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vawnet.org/Assoc_Files_VAWnet/PCAA_DVandChild.pdf|date=September 1996|title=The Relationship Between Domestic Violence and Child Abuse|publisher=Prevent Child Abuse America|access-date=2016-04-16|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207171540/http://www.vawnet.org/Assoc_Files_VAWnet/PCAA_DVandChild.pdf|archive-date=2015-12-07}}</ref>

People in same-sex relationships face special obstacles in dealing with the issues that some researchers have labeled "the double closet". A 1997 Canadian study by Mark W.

This includes potential dismissal by police and some social services, a lack of support from peers, fear of attracting stigma toward the [[gay community]], the impact of an [[HIV/AIDS]] status in keeping partners together (due to health care insurance/access, or guilt), threat of [[outing]], and encountering supportive services that are targeted, or structured for the needs of heterosexual women, and may not meet the needs of gay men or lesbians.

How domestic violence is viewed varies from person to person, and from culture to culture, but in many places outside the West, the concept is very poorly understood. This is because in most of these countries the relation between the husband and wife is not considered one of equals, but instead one in which the wife must submit herself to the husband. This is codified in the laws of some countries – for example, in [[Yemen]], marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.<ref>{{cite book | last = Amnesty International | author-link = Amnesty International | title = Yemen's dark side: discrimination and violence against women and girls | url = https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde31/014/2009/en/ | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | date = November 2009 | access-date = 11 April 2014 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151210214138/https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde31/014/2009/en/ | archive-date = 10 December 2015 }} [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326165645/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrc/docs/ngos/Yemen%27s%20darkside-discrimination_Yemen_HRC101.pdf |date=2016-03-26 }}</ref>

According to ''Violence against Women in Families and Relationships'', "Globally, wife-beating is seen as justified in some circumstances by a majority of the population in various countries, most commonly in situations of actual or suspected infidelity by wives or their "disobedience" toward a husband or partner."<ref>{{citation | last1 = Flood | first1 = Michael | last2 = Pease | first2 = Robert | last3 = Taylor | first3 = Natalie | last4 = Webster | first4 = Kim | author-link = Michael Flood | contribution = Reshaping attitudes towards violence against women | editor-last1 = Buzawa | editor-first1 = Eve S. | editor-last2 = Stark | editor-first2 = Evan | title = Violence against women in families and relationships, Volume IV: the media and cultural attitudes | page = [https://archive.org/details/violenceagainstw0000unse_j3h7/page/184 184] | publisher = Praeger/ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780275998547 | url = https://archive.org/details/violenceagainstw0000unse_j3h7/page/184 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=EE8dkgEACAAJ&dq=Violence+against+women+9780275998547 Details.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110213354/https://books.google.com/books?id=EE8dkgEACAAJ&dq=Violence+against+women+9780275998547 |date=2017-01-10 }}</ref> These violent acts against a wife are often not considered a form of abuse by society (both men and women) but are considered to have been provoked by the behavior of the wife, who is seen as being at fault. While beatings of wives are often a response to "inappropriate" behaviors, in many places extreme acts such as [[honor killing]]s are approved by a high section of the society. In one survey, 33.4% of teenagers in  [[Jordan]]'s capital city, [[Amman]], approved of honor killings. This survey was carried in the capital of Jordan, which is much more liberal than other parts of the country; the researchers said that "We would expect that in the more rural and traditional parts of Jordan, support for honor killings would be even higher".<ref>{{cite news |last=Maher |first=Ahmed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22992365 |title=Many Jordan teenagers 'support honour killings' |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=BBC |date=20 June 2013 |access-date=9 September 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921234334/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22992365 |archive-date=21 September 2013 }}</ref>

According to [[Antonia Parvanova]], one of the difficulties of dealing legally with the issue of DV is that men in many male-dominated societies do not understand that inflicting violence against their wives is against the law. She said, referring to a case that occurred in Bulgaria, "A husband was tried for severely beating his wife and when the judge asked him if he understood what he did and if he's sorry, the husband said "But she's my wife". He doesn't even understand that he has no right to beat her."<ref>{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Seven women die in EU each day due to domestic violence | url = http://www.novinite.com/articles/158764/Seven+Women+Die+in+EU+Each+Day+Due+to+Domestic+Violence | work = [[Novinite]] | publisher = One Click Media Group | location = Bulgaria | date = 8 March 2014 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150405141612/http://www.novinite.com/articles/158764/Seven+Women+Die+in+EU+Each+Day+Due+to+Domestic+Violence | archive-date = 5 April 2015 }}</ref> [[UNFPA]] writes that:<ref>{{cite web | last = UNFPA | author-link = United Nations Population Fund | title = Taking a stand against practices that harm women | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150404082023/http://web.lb.unfpa.org/gender/practices.htm | archive-date = 4 April 2015 | url = http://web.lb.unfpa.org/gender/practices.htm | publisher = United Nations Population Fund | date = April 2015 }}</ref>

Strong views among the population in certain societies that reconciliation is more appropriate than punishment in cases of domestic violence are also another cause of legal impunity; a study found that 64% of public officials in Colombia said that if it were in their hands to solve a case of intimate partner violence, the action they would take would be to encourage the parties to reconcile.<ref>{{cite news | last = Álvarez | first = Camilo Segura | title = Colombia sigue legitimando la violencia contra la mujer | url = http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/colombia-sigue-legitimando-violencia-contra-mujer-articulo-547754 | work = [[El Espectador]] | publisher = [[Fidel Cano Correa]] | date = 5 March 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150510123028/http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/colombia-sigue-legitimando-violencia-contra-mujer-articulo-547754 | archive-date = 10 May 2015 }}</ref>

Judaism, Christianity and Islam have traditionally supported male-dominant households and "socially sanctioned violence against women has been persistent since ancient times."<ref>{{citation | last1 = Buzawa | first1 = Eve S. | last2 = Buzawa | first2 = Carl G. | last3 = Stark | first3 = Evan | contribution = Matters of history, faith, and society | editor-last1 = Buzawa | editor-first1 = Eve S. | editor-last2 = Buzawa | editor-first2 = Carl G. | editor-last3 = Stark | editor-first3 = Evan | title = Responding to domestic violence: the integration of criminal justice and human services | page = 53 | publisher = Sage Publications, Inc | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2012 | edition = 4th | isbn = 9781412956390 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vg-KrOyoFTkC&pg=PA53 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151031213427/https://books.google.com/books?id=Vg-KrOyoFTkC&pg=PA53 | archive-date = 2015-10-31 }}</ref>

The [[Catholic Church]] has been criticized for opposing divorce, and therefore trapping victims of violence in abusive marriages.<ref>{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Book excerpt: Hitchen's 'God is not great' | url = http://www.newsweek.com/book-excerpt-hitchenss-god-not-great-99357 | work = [[Newsweek]] | publisher = Newsweek LLC | date = 21 August 2007 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140905000131/http://www.newsweek.com/book-excerpt-hitchenss-god-not-great-99357 | archive-date = 5 September 2014 }} According to [[Christopher Hitchens]], the opposition of the [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland]] to divorce legalization in that country (where divorce was legalized in 1996) was based on religious dogma which stipulated that "an Irish woman married to a wife-beating and incestuous drunk should never expect anything better, and might endanger her soul if she begged for a fresh start".</ref>

Views on the influence of religion on domestic violence differ.

===Custom and tradition===
[[File:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|Anti-dowry poster in [[Bangalore, India]]]]
Local customs and traditions are often responsible for maintaining certain forms of DV. Such customs and traditions include son preference (the desire of a family to have a boy and not a girl, which is strongly prevalent in parts of Asia), which can lead to abuse and neglect of girls by disappointed family members; child and forced marriages; [[dowry]]; the hierarchic [[caste]] system which stigmatizes "lower castes" and "untouchables", leading to discrimination and restricted opportunities of the females and thus making them more vulnerable to abuse; strict dress codes for women that may be enforced through violence by family members; strong requirement of female virginity before the wedding and violence related to non-conforming women and girls; taboos about [[menstruation]] leading to females being isolated and shunned during the time of menstruation; [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM); ideologies of marital 'conjugal rights' to sex which justify marital rape; the importance given to '[[family honor]]'.<ref>{{cite book | last = UNESCAP | author-link = United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific | title = Harmful traditional practices in three counties of South Asia: culture, human rights and violence against women | url = http://www.unescap.org/resources/harmful-traditional-practices-three-countries-south-asia-culture-human-rights-and-violence | publisher = [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] | date = November 2012 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211144247/http://www.unescap.org/resources/harmful-traditional-practices-three-countries-south-asia-culture-human-rights-and-violence | archive-date = 2015-12-11 }} Gender and Development Discussion Paper Series No. 21.

According to a 2003 report by Human Rights Watch, "Customs such as the payment of '[[bride price]]' (payment made by a man to the family of a woman he wishes to marry), whereby a man essentially purchases his wife's sexual favors and reproductive capacity, underscore men's socially sanctioned entitlement to dictate the terms of sex, and to use force to do so."<ref>{{cite book | last = Human Rights Watch | author-link = Human Rights Watch | title = Policy paralysis: a call for action on HIV/AIDS-related human rights abuses against women and girls in Africa | url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/africa1203/africa1203.pdf | publisher = Human Rights Watch | date = December 2003 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160311131419/https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/africa1203/africa1203.pdf | archive-date = 2016-03-11 }}</ref>

In recent years, there has been progress in the area of addressing customary practices that endanger women, with laws being enacted in several countries. The [[Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children]] is an NGO which works on changing social values, raising consciousness, and enacting laws against harmful traditions which affect the health of women and children in Africa. Laws were also enacted in some countries; for example the 2004 Criminal Code of Ethiopia has a chapter on harmful traditional practices – ''Chapter III – Crimes committed against life, person and health through harmful traditional practices''.<ref>{{citation | last = Ethiopia | author-link = Ethiopia | contribution = Book V: Crimes against individuals and the family, Title I: Crimes against life, person and health, Chapter III: Crimes committed against life, person and health through harmful traditional practices | title = Proclamation No. 414/2004: The criminal code of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia | pages = 191–197 | publisher = Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia | location = Addis Ababa, FDR Ethiopia | date = 2004 | url = https://www.icrc.org/ihl-nat/0/D68B3CC48F569422C1257677002ADF3A | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151211041753/https://www.icrc.org/ihl-nat/0/D68B3CC48F569422C1257677002ADF3A | archive-date = 2015-12-11 }} [https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/70993/75092/F1429731028/ETH70993.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205035323/https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/70993/75092/F1429731028/ETH70993.pdf |date=2016-02-05 }}</ref> In addition, the Council of Europe adopted a convention which addresses [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|domestic violence and violence against women]], and calls for the states which ratify it to create and fully adjudicate laws against acts of violence previously condoned by traditional, culture, custom, in the name of honor, or to correct what is deemed unacceptable behavior.<ref>{{cite web | last = Council of Europe | author-link = Council of Europe | title = Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210) | url = http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm | publisher = Council of Europe | access-date = 22 August 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150216041736/http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm | archive-date = 16 February 2015 }}</ref> The United Nations created the ''Handbook on effective police responses to violence against women'' to provide guidelines to [[Management of domestic violence|address and manage violence]] through the creation of effective laws, law enforcement policies and practices and community activities to break down societal norms that condone violence, criminalize it and create effect support systems for survivors of violence.<ref name="unodc.org">{{citation | last = UNODC | author-link = United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | contribution = Introduction: justice system responses and victim protection · Preventive approaches · Responding to violence against women: the role of the police · Procedural law | editor-last = UNODC | editor-link = United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime | title = Handbook on effective police responses to violence against women | url = http://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/hb_eff_police_responses.pdf | pages = 19, 37–86 | publisher = [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] | series = Criminal Justice Handbook Series | location = Vienna, Austria | year = 2010 | isbn = 9789211302912 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150528071406/http://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/hb_eff_police_responses.pdf | archive-date = 2015-05-28 }}</ref>

===Relation to forced and child marriage===
{{Further|Forced marriage|Child marriage}}
A [[forced marriage]] is a marriage where one or both participants are married without their freely given consent.<ref>{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Ethics guide: forced marriage: introduction | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/forcedmarriage/introduction_1.shtml | work = BBC Ethics | publisher = BBC | access-date = 22 August 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150903060233/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/forcedmarriage/introduction_1.shtml | archive-date = 3 September 2015 }}</ref> In many parts of the world, it is often difficult to draw a line between 'forced' and 'consensual' marriage: in many cultures (especially in [[South Asia]], the [[Middle East]] and parts of [[Africa]]), marriages are prearranged, often as soon as a girl is born; the idea of a girl going against the wishes of her family and choosing herself her own future husband is not socially accepted – there is no need to use threats or violence to force the marriage, the future bride will submit because she simply has no other choice.

===Legislation===
Lack of adequate legislation which criminalizes domestic violence, or, alternatively legislation which prohibits consensual behaviors, may hinder the progress in regard to reducing the incidence of DV.

===Ability to leave===
The ability of victims of domestic violence to leave the relationship is crucial for preventing further abuse. In traditional communities, divorced women often feel rejected and ostracized. In order to avoid this stigma, many women prefer to remain in the marriage and endure the abuse.<ref>{{citation | last = Fields | first = Rona | contribution = The Negev Bedouin: a contemporary remnant of ancient tribal society | editor-last = Fields | editor-first = Rona | title = Against violence against women: the case for gender as a protected class | pages = 63–64 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Basingstoke | year = 2014 | isbn = 9781137439178}}</ref>

===Individual versus family unit rights===
The way the individual rights of a family member versus the rights of the family as a unit are balanced vary significantly in different societies. This may influence the degree to which a government may be willing to investigate family incidents.<ref>{{cite web | last = Human Rights Watch | author-link = Human Rights Watch | title = Uzbekistan: Sacrificing women to save the family?

===Immigration policies===
In some countries, the [[immigration policy]] is tied to whether the person desiring citizenship is married to his/her sponsor. This can lead to persons being trapped in violent relations – such persons may risk deportation if they attempt to separate (they may be accused of having entered into a [[sham marriage]]).<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Douglas | first1 = Debbie | last2 = Go | first2 = Avvy | last3 = Blackstock | first3 = Sarah | title = Editorial opinion: Canadian immigration changes force women to stay with sponsoring spouse for two years | url = https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2012/12/05/canadian_immigration_changes_force_women_to_stay_with_sponsoring_spouse_for_two_years.html | work = [[Toronto Star|The Star]] | publisher = [[Star Media Group]], [[Torstar]] | location = Toronto, Canada | date = 5 December 2012 | access-date = 22 August 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150904192500/http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2012/12/05/canadian_immigration_changes_force_women_to_stay_with_sponsoring_spouse_for_two_years.html | archive-date = 4 September 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Domestic violence victims must not be trapped by deportation fears | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006110720/http://www.immigrantcouncil.ie/research-publications/publications/694-domestic-violence-victims-must-not-be-trapped-by-deportation-fears | archive-date = 6 October 2014 | url = http://www.immigrantcouncil.ie/research-publications/publications/694-domestic-violence-victims-must-not-be-trapped-by-deportation-fears | website = immigrantcouncil.ie | publisher = The Immigrant Council of Ireland (ICI) | date = May 2013 }} [http://immigrantcouncil.ie/files/publications/1a2d6-briefing_document_dv_-_longer_version_-_final_2013.pdf Briefing document by the Domestic Violence Coalition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424204545/http://immigrantcouncil.ie/files/publications/1a2d6-briefing_document_dv_-_longer_version_-_final_2013.pdf |date=2016-04-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = AFP in Sydney | title = Australian migrants trapped in 'slave-like' marriages | url = https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/01/australian-migrants-slave-marriages | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 1 August 2014 | access-date = 22 August 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151011091736/http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/aug/01/australian-migrants-slave-marriages | archive-date = 11 October 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Lyneham | first1 = Samantha | last2 = Richards | first2 = Kelly | title = Human trafficking involving marriage and partner migration to Australia | publisher = Australian Institute of Criminology | location = Canberra, Australia | series = Research and Public Policy Series | id = Paper no. 124 | url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/72187/3/72187.pdf | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205034638/http://eprints.qut.edu.au/72187/3/72187.pdf | archive-date = 2016-02-05 }}</ref> Often the women come from cultures where they will suffer disgrace from their families if they abandon their marriage and return home, and so they prefer to stay married, therefore remaining locked in a cycle of abuse.<ref>{{cite book | last = Raza | first = Nusrat | title = Visa for hell | year = 2011 | publisher = Best Books Publications | location = Lahore | oclc = 772450148 }}</ref>

===Immigrant communities===
Domestic violence occurs in immigrant communities, and often there is little awareness in these communities of the laws and policies of the host country. A study among first-generation South Asians in the UK found that they had little knowledge about what constituted criminal behavior under the English law. The researchers found that "There was certainly no awareness that there could be rape within a marriage".<ref>{{cite news | last = McVeigh | first = Tracy | title = Abuse going unreported in Britain's south Asian communities – study | url = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/19/abuse-going-unreported-in-britains-south-asian-communities-study | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 19 September 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160812152918/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/19/abuse-going-unreported-in-britains-south-asian-communities-study | archive-date = 12 August 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cowburn | first1 = Malcolm | last2 = Gill | first2 = Aisha K. | last3 = Harrison | first3 = Karen | s2cid = 56017459 | title = Speaking about sexual abuse in British South Asian communities: offenders, victims and the challenges of shame and reintegration | journal = Journal of Sexual Aggression | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–15 | doi = 10.1080/13552600.2014.929188 | date = January 2015}}</ref> A study in Australia showed that among the immigrant women sampled who were abused by partners and did not report it, 16.7% did not know DV was illegal, while 18.8% did not know that they could get protection.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Satyen | first1 = Lata | last2 = Ranganathan | first2 = Archna | last3 = Piedra | first3 = Steve | last4 = Simon | first4 = Ben | last5 = Kocsic | first5 = Jessica | title = Family violence in migrant women in Australia: strategies for migrant men to reduce the violence | date = May 2013 }} Conference paper for the White Ribbon International Conference, Sydney, Australia, 13–15 May 2013.

==Causes==
Of the most important factors in domestic violence is a belief that abuse, whether physical or verbal, is acceptable. Other factors include [[substance abuse]], [[unemployment]], mental health problems, lack of coping skills, isolation, and excessive dependence on the abuser.<ref name="Newman p. 11">{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Willis C. | last2 = Newman | first2 = Esmeralda | contribution = What is domestic violence?

===Cycles of violence===

====Cycle of abuse====
[[Lenore E. Walker]] presented the model of a [[cycle of abuse]] which consists of four phases. First, there is a buildup to abuse when tension rises until a domestic violence incident ensues. During the reconciliation stage, the abuser may be kind and loving and then there is a period of calm. When the situation is calm, the abused person may be hopeful that the situation will change. Then, tensions begin to build, and the cycle starts again.<ref name="Hutchison p. 138">Hutchison, Phoebe (2014). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VrYPAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA138 Are You Listening?

====Intergenerational violence====
A common aspect among abusers is that they witnessed abuse in their childhood, in other words they were participants in a chain of [[Cycle of violence|intergenerational cycles of domestic violence]].<ref name=Danieli>{{citation | last1 = Simons | first1 = Ronald L. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = Christine | contribution = An examination of competing explanations for the intergenerational transmission of domestic violence | editor-last = Danieli | editor-first = Yael | title = International handbook of multigenerational legacies of trauma | pages = 553–570 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Plenum Press]] | location = New York London | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780306457388 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=thoNwuDmHEQC&pg=PA553 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140704165827/http://books.google.com/books?id=thoNwuDmHEQC&pg=PA553 | archive-date = 2014-07-04 }}</ref> That does not mean, conversely, that if a child witnesses or is subject to violence that they will become abusers.<ref name="Newman p. 11" /> Understanding and breaking the intergenerational abuse patterns may do more to reduce domestic violence than other remedies for managing the abuse.<ref name=Danieli />

Responses that focus on children suggest that experiences throughout life influence an individual's propensity to engage in family violence (either as a victim or as a perpetrator). Researchers supporting this theory suggest it is useful to think of three sources of domestic violence: childhood socialization, previous experiences in couple relationships during adolescence, and levels of strain in a person's current life. People who observe their parents abusing each other, or who were themselves abused may incorporate abuse into their behaviour within relationships that they establish as adults.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra | last2 = Seltzer | first2 = Judith A. | title = The effect of family structure on family violence: the case of remarriage | location = Durham, New Hampshire | year = 1984 }} Paper presented at the Second National Conference for Family Violence Researchers.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last = Kalmuss | first = Debra | title = The intergenerational transmission of marital aggression | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–19 | doi = 10.2307/351858 | jstor = 351858 | date = February 1984 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra | last2 = Seltzer | first2 = Judith A. | title = Continuity of marital behavior in remarriage: the case of spouse abuse | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–120 | doi = 10.2307/352234 | jstor = 352234 | date = February 1986 }}</ref>

In some patrilineal societies around the world, a young bride moves with the family of her husband. As a new girl in the home, she starts as having the lowest (or among the lowest) position in the family, is often subjected to violence and abuse, and is, in particular, strongly controlled by the parents-in-law: with the arrival of the daughter-in-law in the family, the mother-in-law's status is elevated and she now has (often for the first time in her life) substantial power over someone else, and "This family system itself tends to produce a cycle of violence in which the formerly abused bride becomes the abusing mother-in-law to her new daughter-in-law".<ref>{{citation | last = Ruether | first = Rosemary Radford | contribution = The greening of world religions | editor-last = Ruether | editor-first = Rosemary Radford | title = Integrating ecofeminism, globalization, and world religions | page = 50 | publisher = Rowman & Littlefield Publishers | location = Lanham, Maryland | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780742535305}}</ref> Amnesty International writes that, in [[Tajikistan]], "it is almost an initiation ritual for the mother-in-law to put her daughter-in-law through the same torments she went through herself as a young wife."<ref>{{cite book | last = Amnesty International | author-link = Amnesty International | title = Violence is not just a family affair: women face abuse in Tajikistan | publisher = [[Amnesty International]] | id = Paper no.

=== Substance abuse ===
Domestic violence typically co-occurs with [[alcohol abuse]]. Alcohol use has been reported as a factor by two-thirds of domestic abuse victims. Moderate drinkers are more frequently engaged in intimate violence than are light drinkers and abstainers; however, generally it is heavy or binge drinkers who are involved in the most chronic and serious forms of aggression. The odds, frequency, and severity of physical attacks are all positively correlated with alcohol use. In turn, violence decreases after behavioral marital alcoholism treatment.<ref>{{Citation|last=Sung|first=Hung-En|chapter=Alcohol and Crime|date=2016|encyclopedia=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology|pages=1–2|publisher=American Cancer Society|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781405165518.wbeosa039.pub2|isbn=9781405165518}}</ref>

Social theories look at external factors in the offender's environment, such as family structure, stress, social learning, and includes [[rational choice theory (criminology)|rational choice]] theories.<ref>{{cite web | last1 = Haugan | first1 = Grethemor Skagseth | last2 = Nøttestad | first2 = Jim Aage | title = Norway: treatment program for men who batters | url = http://www.europrofem.org/contri/2_04_en/en-viol/81en_vio.htm | publisher = Violence in intimate relationships Norway: EuroPROFEM – The European Men Profeminist Network, [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] | location = Trondheim, Norway | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726042139/http://www.europrofem.org/contri/2_04_en/en-viol/81en_vio.htm | archive-date = 2011-07-26 }}</ref>

[[Social learning theory]] suggests that people learn from observing and modeling after others' behavior. With [[positive reinforcement]], the behavior continues. If one observes violent behavior, one is more likely to imitate it. If there are no negative consequences (e.g. the victim accepts the violence, with submission), then the behavior will likely continue.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Hotaling | first1 = Gerald T. | last2 = Sugarman | first2 = David B. | s2cid = 24617261 | title = An analysis of risk markers in husband to wife violence: the current state of knowledge | journal = Violence & Victims | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 101–124 | pmid = 3154143 | date = 1986 | doi = 10.1891/0886-6708.1.2.101 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Murphy | first1 = Christopher M. | last2 = Meyer | first2 = Shannon-Lee | last3 = O'Leary | first3 = K.

====Social stress====

Stress may be increased when a person is living in a family situation, with increased pressures. Social stresses, due to inadequate finances or other such problems in a family may further increase tensions.<ref name="gelles"/> Violence is not always caused by stress, but may be one way that some people respond to stress.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kalmuss | first1 = Debra | last2 = Seltzer | first2 = Judith A. | title = Socialization and stress explanations for spouse abuse | journal = [[Social Forces]] | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = 473–491 | doi = 10.2307/2579191 | jstor = 2579191 | date = December 1988 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Aneshensel | first = Carol S.  | title = Social stress: theory and research | journal = [[Annual Review of Sociology]] | volume = 18 | pages = 15–38 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.so.18.080192.000311 | date = August 1992 }}</ref> Families and couples in poverty may be more likely to experience domestic violence, due to increased stress and conflicts about finances and other aspects.<ref name="jewkes2002">{{cite journal | last = Jewkes | first = Rachel | title = Intimate partner violence: causes and prevention | journal = [[The Lancet]] | volume = 359 | issue = 9315 | pages = 1423–1429 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08357-5 | jstor = 11978358 | date = 20 April 2002 | pmid=11978358| s2cid = 18574662 }}</ref> Some speculate that poverty may hinder a man's ability to live up to his idea of "successful manhood", thus he fears losing honor and respect.

Same-sex relationships may experience similar social stressors. Additionally, violence in same-sex relationships has been linked to internalized homophobia, which contributed to low self-esteem and anger in both the perpetrator and victim.<ref name="Murray 2006">{{cite journal | last1 = Murray | first1 = Christine E. | last2 = Mobley | first2 = A.

Similarly, [[heterosexism]] can play a key role in domestic violence in the LGBT community. As a social ideology that implies "heterosexuality is normative, morally superior, and better than [homosexuality],"<ref name="Murray 2006"/> heterosexism can hinder services and lead to an unhealthy self-image in sexual minorities. Heterosexism in legal and medical institutions can be seen in instances of discrimination, biases, and insensitivity toward sexual orientation. For example, as of 2006, seven states explicitly denied LGBT individuals the ability to apply for protective orders,<ref name="Murray 2006"/> proliferating ideas of LGBT subjugation, which is tied to feelings of anger and powerlessness.

====Power and control====
{{Main|Abusive power and control}}
[[File:(2) Cycle of abuse, power & control issues in domestic abuse situations.gif|thumb|Cycle of abuse, power & control issues in domestic abuse situations (double click to enlarge)]]
[[Power (social and political)|Power]] and control in abusive relationships is the way that abusers exert physical, sexual and other forms of abuse to gain control within relationships.<ref>{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Violence wheel | url = http://www.domesticviolence.org/violence-wheel/ | publisher = Domestic Abuse Violence Project (aka [[Duluth Model]]) | access-date = 18 April 2014 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140223092347/http://www.domesticviolence.org/violence-wheel | archive-date = 23 February 2014 }}</ref>

A [[causality|causalist]] view of domestic violence is that it is a strategy to gain or maintain power and control over the victim. This view is in alignment with Bancroft's "cost-benefit" theory that abuse rewards the perpetrator in ways other than, or in addition to, simply exercising power over his or her target(s). He cites evidence in support of his argument that, in most cases, abusers are quite capable of exercising control over themselves, but choose not to do so for various reasons.<ref name=Bancroft>{{cite book | last = Bancroft | first = Lundy | title = Why does he do that?: Inside the minds of angry and controlling men | publisher = [[Berkley Books]] | location = New York, New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780425191651 | url = https://archive.org/details/whydoeshedothati00banc_0 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=xEZIpu3SVvcC Details.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101115109/https://books.google.com/books?id=xEZIpu3SVvcC |date=2015-11-01 }}</ref>

Sometimes, one person seeks complete power and control over their partner and uses different ways to achieve this, including resorting to physical violence. The perpetrator attempts to control all aspects of the victim's life, such as their social, personal, professional and financial decisions.<ref name="justice.gc.ca"/>

Questions of power and control are integral to the widely utilized [[Duluth Domestic Abuse Intervention Project]]. They developed a "Power and Control Wheel" to illustrate this: it has power and control at the center, surrounded by spokes (techniques used), the titles of which include: coercion and [[threat]]s, [[intimidation]], [[emotional abuse]], [[solitude|isolation]], [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimizing]], [[denial|denying]] and blaming, using children, economic abuse, and privilege.<ref>{{cite book | title = Power and control wheel | url = http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf | publisher = National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence | access-date = 18 November 2011 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150314062136/http://www.ncdsv.org/images/Power_and_Control_wheel_NCDSV.pdf | archive-date = 14 March 2015 }}</ref>

=== Nonsubordination theory ===
Nonsubordination theory, sometimes called dominance theory, is an area of [[feminist legal theory]] that focuses on the power differential between men and women.<ref name=":1">[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 327.</ref> Nonsubordination theory takes the position that society, and more especially men in society, use sex differences between men and women to perpetuate this power imbalance.<ref name=":1" /> Unlike other topics within [[feminist legal theory]], nonsubordination theory focuses specifically on certain sexual behaviors, including control of women's [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[sexual harassment]], pornography, and violence against women generally.<ref>[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 328</ref> [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argues that nonsubordination theory best addresses these particular issues because they affect "almost exclusively" women.<ref name=":2">[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 332 citing MacKinnon, Catharine A. (1987) ''Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law''. Harvard University Press. pp. 40–41. {{ISBN|0674298748}}.</ref> MacKinnon advocates for nonsubordination theory over other theories, like formal equality, substantive equality, and difference theory, because [[sexual violence]] and other forms of [[violence against women]] are not a question of "sameness and difference," but rather are best viewed as "more central inequalities" for women.<ref name=":2" />  Though nonsubordination theory has been discussed at great length in evaluating various forms of [[sexual violence]] against women, it also serves as a basis for understanding domestic violence and why it occurs. Nonsubordination theory tackles the issue of domestic violence as a subset of the broader problem of [[violence against women]] because domestic violence victims are overwhelmingly female.<ref>[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 387 citing Rennison, Callie Marie and Welchans, Sarah (May 2000) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090901024747/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov//bjs//pub/pdf/ipv.pdf ''Special Report: Intimate Partner Violence''], Bureau of Justice Statistics.</ref>

Proponents of nonsubordination theory propose several reasons why it works best to explain domestic violence. First, there are certain recurring patterns in domestic violence that indicate it is not the result of intense anger or arguments, but rather is a form of subordination.<ref name=":4">[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], pp. 389–92 citing Fischer, Karla et al. (1993) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37810125_The_Culture_of_Battering_and_the_Role_of_Mediation_in_Domestic_Violence_Cases ''The Culture of Battering and the Role of Mediation in Domestic Violence Cases''], 46 SMU L. Rev. pp. 2117, 2121–2130, 2133, 2136–2138, 2141.</ref> This is evidenced in part by the fact that domestic violence victims are typically abused in a variety of situations and by a variety of means.<ref name=":4" /> For example, victims are sometimes beaten after they have been sleeping or have been separated from the batterer, and often the abuse takes on a financial or emotional form in addition to physical abuse.<ref name=":4" /> Supporters of nonsubordination theory use these examples to dispel the notion that battering is always the result of heat of the moment anger or intense arguments occur.<ref name=":4" /> Also, batterers often employ manipulative and deliberate tactics when abusing their victims, which can "rang[e] from searching for and destroying a treasured object of hers to striking her in areas of her body that do not show bruises (e.g. her scalp) or in areas where she would be embarrassed to show others her bruises."<ref name=":4" /> These behaviors can be even more useful to a batterer when the batterer and the victim share children, because the batterer often controls the family's financial assets, making the victim less likely to leave if it would put her children at risk.<ref>[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 413.</ref>

Professor Martha Mahoney, of the [[University of Miami School of Law]], also points to the notion of "separation assault"—a phenomenon where a batterer further assaults a victim who is attempting or has attempted to leave an abusive relationship—as additional evidence that domestic violence is used to subordinate victims to their batterers.<ref name=":5">[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], pp. 392–93 citing {{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1289533 |jstor=1289533 |title=Legal Images of Battered Women: Redefining the Issue of Separation |journal=Michigan Law Review |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=1–94 |year=1991 |last1=Mahoney |first1=Martha R. |url=https://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1388&context=fac_articles }}</ref> A batterer's unwillingness to allow the victim to leave the relationship substantiates the idea that violence is being used to force the victim to continue to fulfill the batterer's wishes that she obey him.<ref name=":5" /> Nonsubordination theorists argue that all of these actions—the variety of abusive behaviors and settings, exploiting the victim's children, and assault upon separation—suggest a larger problem than merely an inability to properly manage anger, though anger may be a byproduct of these behaviors.<ref name=":4" /> The purpose of these actions is to keep the victim, and sometimes the entire family, subordinate to the batterer, according to nonsubordination theory.<ref name=":5" />

A second rationale for using nonsubordination theory to explain domestic violence, beyond the variety of tactics used by abusers, is that the frequency with which domestic violence occurs overpowers the idea that it is merely the result of a batterer's anger. Professor Mahoney explains that because of the [[sensationalism]] generated in media coverage of "big" or particularly horrific domestic violence cases, it is difficult for people to conceptualize how frequently domestic violence happens in society.<ref name=":5" /> However, domestic violence is a regular occurrence experienced by up to one half of people in the United States, and an overwhelming number of victims are female.<ref name=":5" /> The sheer number of domestic violence victims in the United States suggests that domestic violence is not merely the result of intimate partners who cannot control their anger.<ref name=":5" />  Nonsubordination theory contends that it is the batterer's desire to subordinate the victim, not his uncontainable anger, which explains the frequency of domestic violence.<ref name=":5" />  Nonsubordination theorists argue that other forms of [[feminist legal theory]] do not offer any explanation for the phenomenon of domestic violence generally or the frequency with which it occurs.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Critics of nonsubordination theory complain that it offers no solutions to the problems it points out.  For example, proponents of nonsubordination theory criticize certain approaches that have been taken to address domestic violence in the legal system, such as mandatory arrest or prosecution policies.<ref name=":6">[[#Bartlett|Bartlett et al.]], p. 405</ref> These policies take discretion away from [[law enforcement]] by forcing police officers to arrest suspected domestic violence offenders and prosecutors to prosecute those cases.<ref name=":6" /> There is a lot of discourse surrounding mandatory arrest. Opponents argue that it undermines a victim's autonomy, discourages the empowerment of women by discounting other resources available and puts victims at more risk for domestic abuse. States that have implemented mandatory arrest laws have 60% higher homicide rates which have been shown to be consistent with the decline in reporting rates.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pavlidakis|first=Alexandra|date=January 1, 2009|title=Mandatory Arrest: Past Its Prime|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&context=lawreview|journal=Santa Clara Law Review|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604135236/http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1076&context=lawreview|archive-date=June 4, 2016}}</ref> Advocates of these policies contend that the criminal justice system is sometimes the only way to reach victims of domestic violence, and that if an offender knows he will be arrested, it will [[Deterrence (penology)|deter]] future domestic violence conduct.<ref name=":6" /> People who endorse nonsubordination theory argue that these policies only serve to further subordinate women by forcing them to take a certain course of action, thus compounding the trauma they experienced during the abuse.<ref name=":6" /> However, nonsubordination theory itself offers no better or more appropriate solutions, which is why some scholars argue that other forms of [[feminist legal theory]] are more appropriate to address issues of domestic and [[sexual violence]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

The World Health Organization has stated that women in abusive relations are at significantly higher risk of HIV/AIDS. WHO states that women in violent relationships have difficulty negotiating safer sex with their partners, are often forced to have sex, and find it difficult to ask for appropriate testing when they think they may be infected with HIV.<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Violence against women and HIV/AIDS: critical intersections: intimate partner violence and HIV/AIDS | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva, Switzerland | url =https://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/InfoBulletinIntimatePartnerViolenceFinal.pdf | series = Information Bulletin Series | id = Bulletin no. 1 | date = November 2004 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131025220637/http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/InfoBulletinIntimatePartnerViolenceFinal.pdf | archive-date = 2013-10-25 }}</ref> A decade of cross-sectional research from Rwanda, Tanzania, South Africa, and India, has consistently found women who have experienced partner violence to be more likely to be infected with HIV.<ref>{{cite web | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Facts and figures: ending violence against women | url = http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures#notes | website = unwomen.org | publisher = UN Women | date = October 2015 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150827022736/http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures#notes | archive-date = 2015-08-27 }}</ref> The WHO stated that:<ref name=autogenerated3 />
<blockquote>There is a compelling case to end intimate partner violence both in its own right as well as to reduce women and girls' vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.

Same-sex relationships are similarly affected by the HIV/AIDS status in domestic violence. Research by Heintz and Melendez found that same-sex individuals may have difficulty breaching the topic of safe sex for reasons such as "decreased perception of control over sex, fear of violence, and unequal power distributions..."<ref name="Heintz 2006">{{Cite journal | last1 = Heintz | first1 = Adam J. | last2 = Melendez | first2 = Rita M. | s2cid = 35404907 | title = Intimate partner violence and HIV/STD risk among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–208 | doi = 10.1177/0886260505282104 | pmid = 16368761 | date = February 2006}}</ref> Of those who reported violence in the study, about 50% reported forced sexual experiences, of which only half reported the use of safe sex measures. Barriers to safer sex included fear of abuse, and deception in safe-sex practices. Heintz and Melendez's research ultimately concluded that sexual assault/abuse in same-sex relationships provides a major concern for HIV/AIDS infection as it decreases instances of safe-sex. Furthermore, these incidents create additional fear and stigma surrounding safe-sex conversations and knowing one's STD status.<ref name="Heintz 2006"/>

===Psychological===
Among victims who are still living with their perpetrators high amounts of stress, fear, and anxiety are commonly reported. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] is also common, as victims are made to feel [[guilt (emotion)|guilty]] for 'provoking' the abuse and are frequently subjected to intense [[criticism]]. It is reported that 60% of victims meet the [[Rating scales for depression|diagnostic criteria for depression]], either during or after termination of the relationship, and have a greatly increased risk of suicide. Those who are battered either emotionally or physically often are also depressed because of a feeling of worthlessness. These feelings often persist long-term and it is suggested that many receive therapy for it because of the heightened risk of suicide and other traumatic symptoms.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Barnett | first = Ola W. | title = Why battered women do not leave, part 2: external inhibiting factors — social support and internal inhibiting factors | journal = [[Trauma, Violence, & Abuse]] | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–35 | doi = 10.1177/1524838001002001001 | date = 2001 | s2cid = 146388536 }}</ref>

In addition to depression, victims of domestic violence also commonly experience long-term [[anxiety]] and [[panic]], and are likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for [[generalized anxiety disorder]] and [[panic disorder]]. The most commonly referenced psychological effect of domestic violence is [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). PTSD (as experienced by victims) is characterized by [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]], intrusive images, an exaggerated [[startle response]], [[nightmare]]s, and avoidance of triggers that are associated with the abuse.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Vitanza | first1 = Stephanie | last2 = Vogel | first2 = Laura C.M. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = Linda L. | s2cid = 24929418 | title = Distress and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in abused women | journal = Violence & Victims | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–34 | pmid = 8555116 | date = Spring 1995 | doi = 10.1891/0886-6708.10.1.23 }}</ref> Studies have indicated that it is important to consider the effect of domestic violence and its psychophysiologic sequelae on women who are mothers of infants and young children. Several studies have shown that maternal interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can, despite a traumatized mother's best efforts, interfere with their child's response to the domestic violence and other traumatic events.<ref name=care/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schechter | first1 = Daniel S. | last2 = Coates | first2 = Susan W. | last3 = Kaminer | first3 = Tammy | last4 = Coots | first4 = Tammy | last5 = Zeanah, Jr. | first5 = Charles H. | last6 = Davies | first6 = Mark | last7 = Schonfeld | first7 = Irvin S. | last8 = Marshall | first8 = Randall D. | last9 = Liebowitz | first9 = Michael R. | last10 = Trabka | first10 = Kimberly A. | last11 = McCaw | first11 = Jaime E. | last12 = Myers | first12 = Michael M. | title = Distorted maternal mental representations and atypical behavior in a clinical sample of violence-exposed mothers and their toddlers | journal = Journal of Trauma & Dissociation | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–147 | doi = 10.1080/15299730802045666 | pmid = 18985165 | pmc = 2577290 | date = June 2008 }}</ref>

===Financial===
Once victims leave their perpetrator, they can be stunned with the reality of the extent to which the abuse has taken away their autonomy. Due to economic abuse and isolation, the victim usually has very little money of their own and few people on whom they can rely when seeking help. This has been shown to be one of the greatest obstacles facing victims of DV, and the strongest factor that can discourage them from leaving their perpetrators.<ref name="Stop Violence Against Women">{{cite web | title = Domestic violence and housing | url = https://www.stopvaw.org/Domestic_Violence_and_Housing.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151002061435/http://www.stopvaw.org/Domestic_Violence_and_Housing.html | archive-date = 2 October 2015 | website = stopvaw.org | publisher = Stop Violence Against Women: a project of the Advocates for Human Rights | date = August 2013 }}</ref>

In addition to lacking financial resources, victims of DV often lack specialized skills, education, and training that are necessary to find gainful employment, and also may have several children to support. In 2003, thirty-six major US cities cited DV as one of the primary causes of homelessness in their areas.<ref name="aclu.org">{{cite web | title = Domestic violence and homelessness | url = https://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/housing%20paper.4.pdf | website = aclu.org | publisher = American Civil Liberties Union Women's Rights Project | date = 2007 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130812013406/http://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/housing%20paper.4.pdf | archive-date = 2013-08-12 }}</ref> It has also been reported that one out of every three women are homeless due to having left a DV relationship. If a victim is able to secure rental housing, it is likely that her apartment complex will have "zero tolerance" policies for crime; these policies can cause them to face eviction even if they are the victim (not the perpetrator) of violence.<ref name="aclu.org"/> While the number of shelters and community resources available to DV victims has grown tremendously, these agencies often have few employees and hundreds of victims seeking assistance which causes many victims to remain without the assistance they need.<ref name="Stop Violence Against Women"/>

Due to the gravity and intensity of hearing victims' stories of abuse, professionals (social workers, police, counselors, therapists, advocates, medical professionals) are at risk themselves for secondary or vicarious trauma (VT), which causes the responder to experience trauma symptoms similar to the original victim after hearing about the victim's experiences with abuse.<ref name="Iliffe">{{cite journal | last1 = Iliffe | first1 = Gillian | last2 = Steed | first2 = Lyndall G. | title = Exploring the counselor's experience of working with perpetrators and survivors of domestic violence | journal = Journal of Interpersonal Violence | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 393–412 | doi = 10.1177/088626000015004004 | date = April 2000 | s2cid = 143695998 }}</ref> Research has demonstrated that professionals who experience vicarious trauma show signs of an exaggerated startle response, [[hypervigilance]], nightmares, and [[intrusive thought]]s although they have not experienced a trauma personally and do not qualify for a clinical diagnosis of PTSD.<ref name="Iliffe" />

Prevention and intervention includes ways to prevent domestic violence by offering safe [[Women's shelter|shelter]], [[crisis intervention]], advocacy, and education and prevention programs. Community screening for domestic violence can be more systematic in cases of animal abuse, healthcare settings, emergency departments, behavioral health settings and court systems.

There exist several strategies that are being used to attempt to prevent or reduce DV. It is important to assess the effectiveness of a strategy that is being implemented.<ref name="who.int1">{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Preventing intimate partner and sexual violence against women: taking action and generating evidence | publisher = World Health Organization | location = Geneva, Switzerland | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44350/1/9789241564007_eng.pdf | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205034703/http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44350/1/9789241564007_eng.pdf | archive-date = 2016-02-05 }}</ref>

Reforming the legislation in order to ensure that domestic violence falls under the scope of the law is important. This may imply repealing existing laws which discriminate against women: according to the WHO, "when the law allows husbands to physically discipline wives, implementing a programme to prevent intimate partner violence may have little impact".<ref name="who.int1"/> [[Marriage law]]s are also important, "They [women] should also be able to enter freely into a marriage or to leave it, to obtain financial credit, and to own and administer property."<ref name="who.int1"/> Abolishing or restricting the offering and receiving of [[dowry]] and [[bride price]] and scrutinizing the impact of these transactions on the legislative decisions regarding DV is also important. UN Women has stated that the legislation should ensure that "a perpetrator of domestic violence, including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge".<ref>{{cite book | last = UN Women | author-link = UN Women | title = Supplement to the handbook for legislation on violence against women: "harmful practices" against women | publisher = UN Women | location = New York | year = 2012 | url = http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150610131259/http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2012/12/unw-legislation-supplement-en%20pdf.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2015-06-10  }}</ref>

Gender norms that promote the inferiority of women may lead to the abuse of women by intimate partners. The WHO writes that, "Dismantling hierarchical constructions of masculinity and femininity predicated on the control of women, and eliminating the structural factors that support inequalities are likely to make a significant contribution to preventing intimate partner and sexual violence".<ref name="who.int1"/>

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], "A key strategy in preventing domestic violence is the promotion of respectful, nonviolent relationships through individual, community, and societal level change."<ref>{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Prevent domestic violence in your community | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151003152901/http://www.cdc.gov/features/intimatepartnerviolence/ | archive-date = 3 October 2015 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/features/intimatepartnerviolence/ | website = cdc.gov | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = 2015 }}</ref>
Early intervention programs, such as school-based programs to prevent [[dating violence]] are also effective.<ref name="who.int1"/> Children who grow up in violent homes may be led to believe that such behavior is a normal part of life, therefore it is important to challenge such attitudes when they are present among these children.<ref>{{cite book | last = Dept. for Health | author-link = Department of Health (United Kingdom) | title = Responding to domestic abuse: a handbook for health professionals | publisher = [[Department of Health and Social Care|Department of Health]] | location = London, UK | year = 2005 | url = http://dh.gov.uk/en/publicationsandstatistics/publications/publicationspolicyandguidance/dh_4126161 | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060123125814/dh.gov.uk/en/publicationsandstatistics/publications/publicationspolicyandguidance/dh_4126161 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2006-01-23 | oclc = 278343897 }}</ref>
