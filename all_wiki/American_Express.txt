The '''American Express Company''' ('''Amex''') is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[financial services]] corporation headquartered at [[200 Vesey Street]] in [[New York City]]. The company was founded in 1850 and is one of the 30 components of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/data/markets/dow/?iid=C_MT_Index | title=Dow Jones Industrial Average | work=[[CNN Business|CNN Money]] | accessdate=October 20, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014230313/https://money.cnn.com/data/markets/dow/?iid=C_MT_Index | archive-date=October 14, 2013 | url-status=live }}</ref> The company is best known for its [[charge card]], [[credit card]], and [[traveler's cheque]] businesses.

During the 1980s, ''Amex'' invested in the brokerage industry, acquiring what became, in increments, ''Shearson Lehman Hutton'' and then divesting these into what became ''Smith Barney Shearson'' (owned by [[Primerica]]) and a revived Lehman Brothers. By 2008 neither the Shearson nor the Lehman name existed.<ref>{{cite newspaper |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]

[[File:American Express Company 1865.JPG|thumb|Share of the American Express Company, issued 13. October 1865; signed by William G. Fargo as Secretary and Henry Wells as President]]
In 1850, American Express was started as an [[express mail]] business in [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Recognizing Responsibility: American Express Company 2007/2008 Corporate Citizenship Report|url=http://about.americanexpress.com/csr/docs/cresp.pdf|publisher=American Express Co.|accessdate=2012-07-25|page=8|quote=In 1850, three men—Henry Wells, William G.

American Express initially established its headquarters in a building at the intersection of Jay Street and [[Hudson Street (Manhattan)|Hudson Street]] in what was later called the [[Tribeca]] section of Manhattan. For years it enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the movement of express shipments (goods, securities, currency, etc.) throughout New York State. In 1874, American Express moved its headquarters to 65 Broadway in what was becoming the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of Manhattan, a location it was to retain through two buildings.<ref name="Citycyclopedia">Kenneth T. Jackson. ''The Encyclopedia of New York City''. The New York Historical Society: [[Yale University Press]], 1995. P. 23.</ref>

===American Express buildings===
In 1854, the American Express Co. purchased a lot on Vesey Street in New York City as the site for its stables. The company's first New York headquarters was an 1858 marble Italianate palazzo at 55–61 [[Hudson Street (Manhattan)|Hudson Street]], which had a busy freight depot on the ground story with a spur line from the [[Hudson River Railroad]]. A stable was constructed in 1867, five blocks north at 4–8 Hubert Street.

The company prospered sufficiently that headquarters were moved in 1874 from the wholesale shipping district to the budding Financial District and into rented offices in two five-story brownstone commercial buildings at 63 and 65 Broadway that were owned by the Harmony family.<ref name="LANDMARKS">New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission; [http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/amerexpress.pdf December 12, 1995, Designation List 269; LP-1932] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020225802/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/amerexpress.pdf |date=October 20, 2013 }}</ref>

In 1880, American Express built a new warehouse behind the Broadway Building at 46 Trinity Place. The designer is unknown, but it has a façade of brick arches that are reminiscent of pre-skyscraper New York. American Express has long been out of this building, but it still bears a [[terracotta]] seal with the American Express Eagle.<ref>White, Norval & Willensky, Elliot; ''[[American Institute of Architects|AIA]] Guide to New York City'', 4th Edition; New York Chapter, American Institute of Architects; Crown Publishers/Random House. 2000. {{ISBN|0-8129-3106-8}}; {{ISBN|0-8129-3107-6}}. p.23.</ref> In 1890–91 the company constructed a new ten-story building by [[Edward H. Kendall]] on the site of its former headquarters on [[Hudson Street (Manhattan)|Hudson Street]].

By 1903, the company had assets of some $28&nbsp;million, second only to the [[Citibank|National City Bank of New York]] among [[financial institution]]s in the city. To reflect this, the company purchased the Broadway buildings and site.<ref name="LANDMARKS" />
[[File:American Express Company Building 65 Broadway entrance.jpg|thumb|250x250px|The [[65 Broadway|American Express Company Building]] at 65 Broadway – the former headquarters of the American Express Company]]

At the end of the Wells-Fargo reign in 1914, an aggressive new president, George Chadbourne Taylor (1868–1923), who had worked his way up through the company over the previous thirty years, decided to build a new headquarters. The old buildings, dubbed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "among the ancient landmarks" of lower Broadway, were inadequate for such a rapidly expanding concern.

After some delays due to the First World War, the 21-story [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] [[65 Broadway|American Express Co. Building]] was constructed in 1916–17 to the design of James L. Aspinwall, of the firm of Renwick, Aspinwall & Tucker, the successor to the architectural practice of the eminent [[James Renwick, Jr.]]. The building consolidated the two lots of the former buildings with a single address: [[65 Broadway]]. This building was part of the "Express Row" section of lower Broadway at the time. The building completed the continuous masonry wall of its block-front and assisted in transforming Broadway into the "canyon" of neo-classical masonry office towers familiar to this day.<ref name="AIA22">{{cite AIA5|page=22}}</ref> American Express sold this building in 1975, but retained travel services there. The building was also the headquarters over the years of other prominent firms, including investment bankers [[J. & W. Seligman & Co.|J.& W. Seligman & Co]]. (1940–74), the [[American Bureau of Shipping]], a maritime concern (1977–86), and later J.J. Kenny, and [[Standard & Poor's]], the latter of which renamed the building for itself.<ref name="LANDMARKS" /><ref name="AIA22" />

===Nationwide expansion===
American Express extended its reach nationwide by arranging affiliations with other express companies (including [[History of Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo]]<!-- Link should be to "History of Wells Fargo" article as it relates to the original Wells, Fargo & Company founded in 1852 by two of Amex's founders (and ultimately acquired by Amex).

===Financial services===
In 1857, American Express started its expansion in the area of financial services by launching a [[money order]] business<ref name="Citycyclopedia" /> to compete with the [[United States Post Office]]'s money orders.

[[File:Amer express dog 1890.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The American Express logo in 1890 depicting a watchdog lying on top of a shipping trunk to symbolize trust and security]]
Sometime between 1888 and 1890, [[J. C. Fargo]] took a trip to Europe and returned frustrated and infuriated. Despite the fact that he was president of American Express and that he carried with him traditional [[letter of credit|letters of credit]], he found it difficult to obtain cash anywhere except in major cities. Fargo went to [[Marcellus Flemming Berry]] and asked him to create a better solution than the letter of credit. Berry introduced the American Express [[traveler's cheque|Traveler's Cheque]] which was launched in 1891 in denominations of $10, $20, $50, and $100.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,866900-7,00.html Host With The Most] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616020709/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,866900-7,00.html |date=June 16, 2010 }}, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', April 9, 1956 issue</ref>

Traveler's cheques established American Express as a truly international company. In 1914, at the onset of [[World War I]], American Express in Europe was among the few companies to honor the letters of credit (issued by various banks) held by Americans in Europe, because other financial institutions refused to assist these stranded travelers.

The British government appointed American Express its official agent at the beginning of World War I.  They were to deliver letters, money, and relief parcels to British prisoners of war.  Their employees went into camps to cash drafts for both British and French prisoners and arranged for them to receive money from home.

By the end of the war they were delivering 150 tonnes of parcels per day to prisoners in six countries.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barham|first1=Peter|title=The impact of the Great War in 1916.|journal=Great Eastern Journal|date=January 2016|issue=165|page=14}}</ref>

===Loss of railroad express business===
American Express was one of the monopolies that [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Theodore Roosevelt]] had the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC) investigate during his administration. The interest of the ICC was drawn to its strict control of the railroad express business. However, the solution did not come immediately to hand.<ref name="Citycyclopedia" /> The solution to this problem came as a coincidence to other problems during World War I.

During the winter of 1917, the United States suffered a severe coal shortage and on December 26 [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] commandeered the railroads on behalf of the United States government to move [[United States Armed Forces|federal troops]], their supplies, and coal. Treasury Secretary [[William Gibbs McAdoo]] was assigned the task of consolidating the railway lines for the [[war effort]]. All contracts between express companies and railroads were nullified and McAdoo proposed that all existing express companies be consolidated into a single company to serve the country's needs. This ended American Express's express business and removed them from the ICC's interest. The result was that a new company called the [[Railway Express Agency|American Railway Express Agency]] formed in July 1918. The new entity took custody of all the pooled equipment and property of existing express companies (the largest share of which, 40%, came from American Express, who had owned the rights to the express business over {{convert|71280|mi|km}} of railroad lines, and had 10,000 offices, with over 30,000 employees).

===Investment banking (Shearson Lehman Hutton, IDS: 1981-1994===
[[File:Shearson Lehman Logo.png|170px|Shearson Lehman logo|thumb|right]]
During the 1980s, American Express embarked on an effort to become a financial services supercompany, and made a number of acquisitions,
creating an investment banking arm. In mid-1981 it purchased [[Sanford I. Weill]]'s [[Shearson Loeb Rhoades]], the second-largest securities firm in the United States to form '''[[Shearson/American Express]]'''.

Shearson Loeb Rhoades itself was the culmination of several mergers in the 1970s as Weill's [[Hayden, Stone & Co.]] merged with [[Shearson, Hammill & Co.]] in 1974, to form [[Shearson Hayden Stone]]. Shearson Hayden Stone then merged with [[Loeb, Rhoades, Hornblower & Co.]] (formerly [[Loeb, Rhoades & Co.]]) to form Shearson Loeb Rhoades in 1979. With capital totaling $250&nbsp;million at the time of its acquisition, Shearson Loeb Rhoades trailed only [[Merrill Lynch]] as the securities industry's largest [[brokerage firm]].

After the purchase of Shearson, Weill was given the position of president of American Express in 1983. Weill grew increasingly unhappy with responsibilities within American Express and his conflicts with American Express' CEO [[James D. Robinson III]]. Weill soon realized that he was not positioned to be named CEO and left in August 1985.

In 1984, American Express acquired the [[investment banking]] and trading firm [[Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb]], and added it to the Shearson family, creating '''Shearson Lehman/American Express'''.  It was Lehman's CEO and former trader [[Lewis Glucksman]] who would next lead Shearson Lehman/American Express.

[[File:Shearson AmEx Logo.png|320px|Shearson/American Express logo c. 1982|thumb|right]]
In 1984, Shearson/American Express also purchased the 90-year-old ''[[Investors Diversified Services]]'' (IDS), bringing with it a fleet of financial advisors and investment products.

In 1988, Shearson Lehman acquired the brokerage firm [[E.F. Hutton & Co.]]. E.F. Hutton was merged with the investment banking business and the investment banking arm was renamed '''[[Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.]]'''<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/03/business/shearson-reported-to-acquire-hutton-in-a-1-billion-deal.html |title=Shearson Reported To Acquire Hutton In a $1 Billion Deal |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 3, 1987 |first=Robert J. |last=Cole |access-date=February 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110012931/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/03/business/shearson-reported-to-acquire-hutton-in-a-1-billion-deal.html |archive-date=November 10, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Divesting====
When [[Harvey Golub]] became CEO of American Express in 1993, American Express decided to get out of the investment banking business and negotiated the sale of Shearson's retail brokerage and [[Investment management|asset management]] business to [[Primerica]]. The Shearson business was merged with Primerica's [[Smith Barney]] to create '''[[Smith Barney Shearson]]'''. Ultimately, the Shearson name was dropped in 1994.<ref name=shearsondropped>{{cite newspaper |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]

In 1994, American Express spun off of the remaining investment banking and institutional businesses as [[Lehman Brothers|Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc]], ending what ''''The New York Times'''' called "a nettlesome foray into the brokerage business."<ref>{{cite newspaper

==Charge card services==
[[File:World Financial Center.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[American Express Tower]] (tallest, left) in New York City]]
American Express executives discussed the possibility of launching a travel [[charge card]] as early as 1946, but it was not until [[Diners Club]] launched a card in March 1950, that American Express began to seriously consider the possibility. At the end of 1957, American Express CEO [[Ralph Reed (American Express)|Ralph Reed]] decided to get into the card business, and by the launch date of October 1, 1958, public interest had become so significant that 250,000 cards were issued prior to the official launch date. The card was launched with an annual fee of $6, $1 higher than Diners Club, to be seen as a premium product. The first cards were made of paper, with the account number and cardmember's name typed. In 1959, American Express began issuing embossed [[ISO/IEC 7810]] plastic cards, an industry first.<ref name=ourstory>{{cite web|website=American Express|url=https://secure.cmax.americanexpress.com/Internet/GlobalCareers/Staffing/Shared/Files/our_story_3.pdf|title=Our Story|access-date=September 8, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303203130/https://secure.cmax.americanexpress.com/Internet/GlobalCareers/Staffing/Shared/Files/our_story_3.pdf|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==History of card types==
In 1966, American Express introduced the Gold Card.<ref name=ourstory/> In 1984, the company launched the Platinum Card, clearly defining different [[market segment]]s within its own business, a practice that has proliferated across a broad array of industries.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://about.americanexpress.com/news/pr/2011/pct.aspx | title=American Express Platinum Card Packs on the Perks for International Travelers | publisher=American Express | date=April 5, 2011 | access-date=April 12, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520201642/http://about.americanexpress.com/news/pr/2011/pct.aspx | archive-date=May 20, 2017 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Platinum Card was billed as super-exclusive and had a $250 annual fee ({{as of|September 2019|lc=yes}}, the fee is $550<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/platinum/|website=American Express|title=The Platinum Card|access-date=December 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016202121/https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/platinum/|archive-date=October 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>). It was offered by invitation only to American Express customers with at least two years of tenure, significant spending, and excellent payment history; {{as of|2019|lc=yes}}, it is open to applicants on request. In 1987, American Express introduced the Optima card, its first credit card product that did not have to be paid in full at the end of the month.

American Express formed a venture with [[Warner Communications]] in 1979, called [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]], which created MTV, [[Nickelodeon]], and [[The Movie Channel]]. The partnership lasted only until 1984. The properties were sold to [[Viacom (1971–2005)|Viacom]] soon after.

In April 1992, American Express spun off its former subsidiary, [[First Data Corp.]], in an [[initial public offering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.firstdata.com/en_us/about-first-data/media/first-data-history.html|website=First Data|title=First Data History|access-date=April 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317144814/https://www.firstdata.com/en_us/about-first-data/media/first-data-history.html|archive-date=March 17, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1994, the Optima True Grace card was introduced. The card was unique in that it offered a [[grace period]] on all purchases whether a balance was carried on the card or not (as opposed to traditional revolving credit cards which charge interest on new purchases if so much as $1 was carried over).<ref>{{cite newspaper |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]

|archive-date=April 13, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> The card was discontinued a few years later.

The ''ONE'' card, introduced 2005 but since discontinued, innovated in ''cash back rewards'' (described then as "have become staples of credit card reward programs") which are "deposited in an interest bearing savings account"<ref>{{cite web  |website=creditcard.com

==Fees==
==="Boston Fee Party"===
From the early 1980s until the early 1990s, American Express was known for cutting its [[interchange fee]] (also known as a "discount rate") to merchants and restaurants if they accepted only American Express and no other credit or charge cards. This prompted competitors such as [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[Mastercard]] to cry foul for a while as the tactics "locked" restaurants into American Express. Capitalizing on this elitist image, American Express frequently mentioned such exclusive partnerships in its advertising.<ref>{{cite video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=American Express Super Bowl XXV ad feat. Dana Carvey & Jon Lovitz - Travelling (1991)|date=April 16, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeSnqSfRkgE|access-date=September 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323090235/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeSnqSfRkgE|archive-date=March 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Aside from some holdouts including [[Neiman Marcus]] (which continued exclusivity until 2011), the practice largely ended in 1991.<ref>{{cite newspaper |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]

|title=More Restaurants Are Just Saying No to American Express
|author=Leonard Sloane  |date=April 13, 1991}}</ref> A group of restaurants in [[Boston]] stopped accepting American Express while accepting and encouraging the use of Visa and Mastercard, including some that were exclusive to American Express. The rationale was due to far lower fees as compared with American Express' fees at the time (which were about 4% for each transaction versus around 1.2% at the time for Visa and Mastercard). The revolt, known as the "Boston Fee Party" (alluding to the [[Boston Tea Party]]), spread to over 250 restaurants across the United States, including restaurants in other cities such as [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], and [[Los Angeles]]. Visa offered to pay the Fee Party's legal bills, and [[Discover Card]] was able to increase their acceptance among Boston restaurants by 375%. Kenneth Chenault, then head of Travel Related Services prior to becoming American Express CEO, cut fees to bring these restaurants back into the fold.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-how-amex-lost-costco/| title=How Bad Will It Get for American Express?| last1=Leonard| first1=Devin| last2=Dexheimer| first2=Elizabeth| publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]

===Conversion to bank holding company===

===Charging order controversy in the UK===
In November 2010, the UK division of American Express was cautioned by the [[Office of Fair Trading]] for the use of controversial [[charging order]]s against those in debt.<ref>{{cite web| title=OFT Warns Credit Card Providers Off 'Charging Orders'| url=http://www.choose.net/money/guide/news/oft-warns-against-charging-orders.html| publisher=Choose| date=November 10, 2010| access-date=January 26, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302053525/http://www.choose.net/money/guide/news/oft-warns-against-charging-orders.html| archive-date=March 2, 2012| url-status=live}}</ref> The regulator said that the company was one of four companies who were encouraging customers to turn their unsecured credit card debts into a form of secured debt.

===CFPB enforcement action===
In October 2012, The [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB) announced an enforcement action with orders requiring three American Express subsidiaries to refund an estimated $85{{nbsp}}million to approximately 250,000 customers for illegal card practices between 2003 and 2012.

===Costco exclusivity arrangement (2004–2016)===
Beginning in 2004, [[Costco]] issued co-branded American Express cards which also doubled as a membership card. Costco ended this arrangement in 2016, in the United States and in 2015, in Canada. The cards did not have annual fees and offered cash back in form of in-store rebates on certain tiers of purchases. The TrueEarnings cards issued by Costco in the United States were an extension of an exclusive credit card network deal between Costco and American Express dating from 1999. Costco was the last major U.S. merchant that accepted American Express cards exclusively. In November 2011, [[Neiman Marcus]], which gave similar general-purpose card exclusivity to American Express since 1987, began accepting Visa and [[Mastercard]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}

On February 12, 2015, it was announced that the partnership between American Express and Costco in the United States would dissolve March 31, 2016, which was later extended to June 19, 2016. By March 2, 2015, Costco announced that [[Citigroup]] would become the exclusive issuer of Costco's credit cards and that [[Visa Inc.]] would replace American Express as the exclusive credit card network accepted at Costco's stores in the United States. The Costco deal with Visa began on June 20, 2016, and in addition to the new Citi card, Costco accepted all other Visa cards.<ref>{{cite news| newspaper=[[San Antonio Express-News]]| url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/business/national/article/What-to-expect-from-Costco-s-new-deal-with-Visa-6119462.php| title=What to Expect From Costco's New Deal With Visa| access-date=January 22, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201221834/http://www.mysanantonio.com/business/national/article/What-to-expect-from-Costco-s-new-deal-with-Visa-6119462.php| archive-date=February 1, 2016| url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Los Angeles Times">{{cite news| url=https://latimes.com/business/la-fi-costco-visa-20150302-story.html| title=Costco names Citi, Visa as new credit card partners after AmEx deal ends| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date=March 2, 2015| accessdate=July 1, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703133135/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-costco-visa-20150302-story.html| archive-date=July 3, 2015| url-status=live}}</ref> All TrueEarnings card accounts and balances held by American Express were sold to Citigroup, and new Costco Anywhere Visa cards were sent to Costco members prior to the switch date.

In 1958, American Express issued its first [[charge card]], which required payment at the end of every month.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clairetsosie/2016/08/29/what-the-first-credit-cards-were-like/| title=What The First Credit Cards Were Like| first=Claire| last=Tsosie| journal=[[Forbes]]| date=August 29, 2016| access-date=April 9, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410133053/https://www.forbes.com/sites/clairetsosie/2016/08/29/what-the-first-credit-cards-were-like/| archive-date=April 10, 2017| url-status=live}}</ref> In 1966, the company issued its first gold card, in an effort to cater to the upper echelon of business travel.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/business/american-express-turns-to-its-core-customers-the-affluent.html| title=With Revamped Gold Cards, Bruised American Express Returns Focus to Affluent| first=Hilary| last=Stout| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=February 26, 2015| access-date=April 9, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205130404/https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/business/american-express-turns-to-its-core-customers-the-affluent.html| archive-date=February 5, 2018| url-status=live}}</ref> Its platinum card debuted in 1984.<ref>{{cite press release| url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-platinum-cardr-from-american-express-celebrates-its-20th-anniversary-71350477.html| title=The Platinum Card From American Express Celebrates Its 20th Anniversary| publisher=American Express| via=[[PRNewswire]]| date=July 21, 2004| access-date=April 9, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410213712/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-platinum-cardr-from-american-express-celebrates-its-20th-anniversary-71350477.html| archive-date=April 10, 2017| url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1999, American Express introduced the [[Centurion Card]], often referred to as the "black card," which caters to an even more affluent customer segment. The card was initially available only to select users of the Platinum card. The annual fee for the card in the United States is $5,000 (up from $1,000 at introduction) with an additional one-time initiation fee of $10,000. American Express created the card line amid rumors and [[urban legend]]s in the 1980s that it produced an ultra-exclusive black card for elite users who could purchase anything with it.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.snopes.com/business/bank/blackcard.asp| website=[[Snopes.com]]| title=Black American Express Card| date=December 6, 2006| accessdate=December 11, 2010}}</ref>

American Express cards issued in the United States range in cost between no annual fee (for Blue and many other consumer and business cards) and a $550 annual fee (for the Platinum card).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/02/american-express-revamps-platinum-card-with-200-bonuses-and-550-fee.html|title=Amex revamps Platinum card with new bonuses ... and fees|last=Anderson|first=Tom|date=2017-03-02|website=[[CNBC]]|access-date=2019-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920204221/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/02/american-express-revamps-platinum-card-with-200-bonuses-and-550-fee.html|archive-date=September 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Annual fees for the Green card start at $150, while Gold card annual fees start at $250.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/green/ |title=Green |website=americanexpress.com |access-date=2019-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191127154053/https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/green |archive-date=November 27, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/gold-card/ |title=Gold Card |website=americanexpress.com |access-date=2019-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016202103/https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/gold-card/ |archive-date=October 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

American Express has several co-branded credit cards, with most falling into one of three categories:
* Airlines: [[Aerolineas Argentinas]], [[Aeroméxico]], [[Air Canada]], [[Air France]], [[Alitalia]], [[British Airways]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Icelandair]], [[KLM]], [[Qantas]], [[Scandinavian Airlines]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[SriLankan Airlines]], [[Thai Airways]], [[Virgin Atlantic]], [[Virgin Australia]], among others.
* Hotels: [[Best Western]], [[Hilton Hotels]], and [[Marriott International]]
* Retailers: [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]], [[Holt Renfrew]], [[Harrods]], [[Macy's]], [[Bloomingdales]], [[Lowe's]], [[Mercedes Benz]], [[Dillard's]] and others.

A credit card aimed at young adults is called ''Blue'', which has no annual fee and a [[loyalty program]]. A television media campaign for Blue adopted the 1979 UK [[Synthpop]] hit "[[Cars (song)|Cars]]" by [[Gary Numan]] as its [[theme music]]. A [[cashback reward program]] version, "Blue Cash", quickly followed. American Express also targeted young adults with City Reward Cards that earn INSIDE Rewards points to eat, drink, and play in New York, Chicago, and LA hot spots. American Express began phasing out the INSIDE cards in mid-2008, with no new applications being taken as of July 2008.

In 2002, American Express introduced Clear, advertised as the first credit card with no fees of any kind.  Other cards introduced in 2005, included "The Knot" and "The Nest" Credit Cards from American Express, co-branded cards developed with the wedding planning website theknot.com.

In 2006, the UK division of American Express joined the [[Product Red]] coalition and issued a Red Card, donating with each purchase through [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] to help African women and children suffering from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/american-express-launches-red-card-digital-campaign/544285| title=American Express launches Red Card with digital campaign| first=Emma| last=Rig| journal=[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]]| date=March 3, 2006| accessdate=February 4, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206131435/https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/american-express-launches-red-card-digital-campaign/544285| archive-date=February 6, 2018| url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2009, American Express introduced the ZYNC charge card. White in color, this card was created for people aged 20–40.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/american-express-zync-will-young-adults-want-a-charge-card/| title=American Express Zync: Will Young Adults Want a Charge Card?| last=Lieber| first=Ron| work=[[The New York Times]]| access-date=2018-01-18| language=en| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119060640/https://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/american-express-zync-will-young-adults-want-a-charge-card/| archive-date=January 19, 2018| url-status=live}}</ref> The Zync charge card has since been discontinued with the exception of current cardholders who are [[grandfathered]] into the ZYNC.

In late 2012, American Express and [[Walmart]] announced the launch of Bluebird, a [[prepaid debit card]] similar to that of [[Green Dot Corporation|Green Dot]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://about.americanexpress.com/news/pr/2012/american-express-and-walmart-launch-bluebird.aspx| title=American Express and Walmart Launch Bluebird: a New Alternative to Debit and Checking Accounts| accessdate=September 21, 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911181007/http://about.americanexpress.com/news/pr/2012/american-express-and-walmart-launch-bluebird.aspx| archive-date=September 11, 2014| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}</ref> Bluebird is being touted as having some of the benefits of traditional American Express cards, such as [[roadside assistance]] and [[identity theft]] protection. The card can also be used as a substitute for a traditional [[Transactional account|checking account]]. Unlike other such cards, Bluebird is [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation|FDIC]]-insured.<ref>Kopecki, Dawn.

===Card acceptance outside the United States===
American Express credit cards are noted by travel guides, including [[Rough Guides]] and [[Lonely Planet]], as being less commonly accepted in Europe than Visa or Mastercard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/europe/france/travel-essentials/|title=Travel essentials|work=[[Rough Guides]]|accessdate=September 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901022929/http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/europe/france/travel-essentials/|archive-date=September 1, 2014|url-status=live}}'' Note: Click 'Read more' to expand information''</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/denmark/a/nar-gr/money-and-costs/358836| title=Denmark: Money and Costs| work=[[Lonely Planet]]| accessdate=February 4, 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205184433/https://www.lonelyplanet.com/denmark/a/nar-gr/money-and-costs/358836| archive-date=February 5, 2018| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.visitlondon.com/traveller-information/essential-information/money/british-money| title=British Money| date=April 10, 2007| publisher=[[London and Partners|Visit London]]| accessdate=February 4, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222025946/http://www.visitlondon.com/traveller-information/essential-information/money/british-money| archive-date=December 22, 2016| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.dreamofitaly.com/public/Italy-Travel-FAQ-What-is-The-Best-Way-to-Get-Euros-and-Pay-For-Things-in-Italy.cfm| title=Italy Travel F.A.Q.: What is The Best Way to Get Euros and Pay For Things in Italy?| publisher=Dream of Italy| access-date=May 29, 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529122702/http://www.dreamofitaly.com/public/Italy-Travel-FAQ-What-is-The-Best-Way-to-Get-Euros-and-Pay-For-Things-in-Italy.cfm| archive-date=May 29, 2014| url-status=live}}</ref>

===Card design===
The company logo, a gladiator or centurion, appears at the center of the iconic Zync, Cobalt, Green, Gold, Platinum, and Centurion cards. The figure and his pose evoke [[classical antiquity]]. These cards also feature intricate border and background designs that read "American Express." The designs on these cards, especially the Green card, bear resemblance to those on the United States [[Federal Reserve Notes]].

===ExpressPay===
[[File:EMVCoContactlessIndicator.svg|right|75px]]
[[File:Americanexpressplatinumemvcontactless.jpg|thumb|left|A Platinum American Express Charge Card issued in the UK that is contactless-enabled]]
In 2005, American Express introduced ExpressPay, similar to Mastercard [[Mastercard#Mastercard Contactless|Contactless]] and Visa [[payWave]], all of which use the symbol appearing on the right. It is a [[contactless payment]] system based on wireless [[RFID]], where transactions are completed by holding the credit card near a receiver at which point the debt is immediately added to the account. All three contactless systems use the same logo. The card is not swiped or inserted into a smart card reader and no PIN is entered.

Many merchants, in the U.S. and globally, offer American Express contactless payment, including [[Meijer]], [[Walgreens]], [[Best Buy]], [[Chevron Corporation]], [[Starbucks]], and [[McDonald's]].

===American Express OPEN===
American Express OPEN, the small-business branch of American Express, offers various types of charge cards for small businesses to manage their expenses.

In late 2007, the company announced the new Plum Card as the latest addition to their card line for [[small business]] owners.<ref name="American-Express-Oct-2007-8-K">{{cite web |url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2534/496207000049/filing-main.htm |title=American Express, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Oct 22, 2007 |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission |accessdate=Jan 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512043558/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2534/496207000049/filing-main.htm |archive-date=May 12, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The card provides a 1.5% early pay discount or up to two months to defer payment on purchases. The 1.5% discount is available for billing periods where the cardmember spends at least $5,000. The first 10,000 cards were issued to members on December 16, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.plumcard.com |title=Official Plum Card Website |publisher=Plumcard.com |accessdate=December 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010195402/http://www.plumcard.com/ |archive-date=October 10, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2008, American Express closed all Business Line of Credit accounts. This decision was reached in tandem with the Federal Reserve's approval of American Express's request to become a [[commercial bank]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.usbusinessfinancecorp.com/financeblog/american-express-closes-business-lines-of-credit.html |title=American Express Closes Business Lines of Credit |access-date=April 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410214503/http://www.usbusinessfinancecorp.com/financeblog/american-express-closes-business-lines-of-credit.html |archive-date=April 10, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{As of|2016|7}}, American Express has several credit cards designed for small businesses. These include SimplyCash Plus Business Credit Card. Cashback earned is automatically credited to the cardholder's statement and other benefits are included.  Other cards include the Business Platinum Card from American Express OPEN, the Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN, the Blue for Business Credit Card from American Express, Business Green Rewards Card from American Express OPEN, the Business Green Rewards Card from American Express OPEN and the Plum Card from American Express OPEN.  These cards have return protection, year-end summaries and other tools to help with the business accounting and control.<ref name=Daniel>Daniel, Ivan.

===Commercial cards and services===
In 2008, American Express acquired the Corporate Payment Services business of GE, which primarily focused on providing Purchasing Card solutions for large global clients.<ref name="American-Express-Mar-2008-8-K">{{cite web |url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/824/496208000005/filing-main.htm |title=American Express, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Mar 27, 2008 |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission |accessdate=Jan 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512050655/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/824/496208000005/filing-main.htm |archive-date=May 12, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> As part of the $1b+ transaction, American Express also added a new product, called V-Payment, to its product portfolio. V-Payment is unique in that it enables a tightly controlled, single-use card number for increased control.

{{As of|2016|7}}, American Express offered several business, corporate and travel credit and charge cards and services and data and information services related to their use in the competitive markets for these cards.<ref name=DeLuna>[http://www.businesstravelnews.com/Payment-Expense/Amex-Cuts-CEOs-Pay Amex Cuts CEO Pay] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910182357/http://www.businesstravelnews.com/Payment-Expense/Amex-Cuts-CEOs-Pay |date=September 10, 2016 }} DeLuna, JoAnn, Business Travel News.

American Express Corporate Card program can be used with a third-party on-demand expense management tool by Concur, a provider of integrated travel and expense management services.

The corporate cards have benefits including discounts and rebates for travel and transportation, travel and emergency help, travel insurance and baggage protection.<ref name=Kerr/> Upgrades from the Corporate "Green" Card to the Corporate Gold Card or Corporate Platinum Card, although subject to fees and terms and conditions, have several additional benefits at each card level, such as free breakfast or late checkout at many hotels.<ref name=Kerr/> The American Express/Business Extra Corporate Credit Card is affiliated with American Airlines and provides a 4% rebate on eligible American Airlines travel purchased with the card.<ref name=Kerr/>

===Non-proprietary cards===
In December 2000, American Express agreed to acquire the US$226{{nbsp}}million credit card portfolio of [[Bank of Hawaii]], then a division of [[Pacific Century Financial Corporation|Pacific Century Financial Corp.]]<ref name="American-Express-Jan-2001-8-K">{{cite web |url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2655/496201500004/filing-main.htm |title=American Express, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Jan 22, 2001 |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission |accessdate=Jan 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512082051/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2655/496201500004/filing-main.htm |archive-date=May 12, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In January 2006, American Express sold its Bank of Hawaii card portfolio to [[Bank of America]] ([[MBNA]]). Bank of America will issue [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and American Express cards under the Bank of Hawaii name.

Until 2004, Visa and [[Mastercard]] rules prohibited issuers of their cards from issuing American Express cards in the United States. This meant, as a practical matter, that U.S. banks could not issue American Express cards. These rules were struck down as a result of antitrust litigation brought by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]], and are no longer in effect.<ref name="American-Express-Mar-2004-10-K">{{cite web |url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1342/95011704000966/filing-main.htm |title=American Express, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Mar 12, 2004 |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission |accessdate=Jan 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512060014/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1342/95011704000966/filing-main.htm |archive-date=May 12, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In January 2004, American Express reached a deal to have its cards issued by a U.S. bank, [[MBNA]] America.<ref name="American-Express-Feb-2004-8-K">{{cite web |url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1529/496204000044/filing-main.htm |title=American Express, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Feb 2, 2004 |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission |accessdate=January 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512044824/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1529/496204000044/filing-main.htm |archive-date=May 12, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Initially decried by Mastercard executives as nothing but an "experiment", these cards were released in October 2004.<ref name="American-Express-Jan-2005-8-K">{{cite web |url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2830/496205000012/filing-main.htm |title=American Express, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Jan 24, 2005 |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission |accessdate=Jan 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512061705/http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2830/496205000012/filing-main.htm |archive-date=May 12, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Some said that the relationship was going to be threatened by MBNA's merger with Bank of America, a major Visa issuer and original developer of Visa (and its predecessor, BankAmericard).

Also, American Express will dismiss Bank of America from its antitrust litigation against Visa, Mastercard, and a number of U.S. banks. Finally, both Bank of America and American Express also said an existing card-issuing partnership between MBNA and American Express will continue after the Bank of America-MBNA merger. The first card from the partnership, the no-annual-fee Bank of America Rewards American Express card, was released on June 30, 2006.

Since then, [[Citibank]], [[Wells Fargo]], [[First National Bank of Omaha]], [[USAA]], [[Navy Federal Credit Union|Navy Federal]], [[Synchrony Financial]], and [[US Bancorp]] have started issuing American Express cards. Citi issues the [[Macy's]] and [[Bloomingdale's]] American Express cards along with Citi-branded cards. Wells Fargo issues American Express cards under their own brand and for [[Dillard's]]. US Bancorp issues American Express-branded cards for US Bank along with Elan Card Services, a subsidiary that issues credit cards on behalf of small to midsize banks. Some [[credit unions]], including [[PenFed]], also issue American Express cards. [[JPMorgan Chase]] is the largest bank and the only [[Big Four (banking)#United States|Big Four bank]] in the US that does not partner with American Express.

In 2005, American Express released the American Express Travelers Check Card, a [[stored-value card]] that serves the same purposes as a traveler's check, but can be used in stores like a credit card. AmEx discontinued the card in October 2007, due to "changing market conditions" and issued refund checks to cardholders for the remaining balances.

==Advertising campaigns==

===Don't Leave Home Without Them===
In 1975, [[David Ogilvy (businessman)|David Ogilvy]] of [[Ogilvy & Mather]] developed the highly successful "Don't Leave Home Without Them" [[Advertising campaign|ad campaign]] for American Express Traveler's Cheques, featuring Oscar-award-winning actor [[Karl Malden]]. Malden served as the public face of American Express Travelers Cheques for 25 years. In the UK, the spokesman was the [[Celebrity|television personality]] [[Alan Whicker]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/05/28/nike-bmw-amex-apple-cmo-network-best-advertising-taglines_slide_4.html |title=Best-Loved Advertising Taglines |last=Bruno |first=Ken |work=[[Forbes]] |date=May 29, 2010 |accessdate=May 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507090036/https://www.forbes.com/2010/05/28/nike-bmw-amex-apple-cmo-network-best-advertising-taglines_slide_4.html |archive-date=May 7, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

After Malden's departure, and as the card assumed importance over the traveler's cheques, American Express continued to use celebrities, such as [[Mel Blanc]] and ballerina [[Cynthia Gregory]].<ref>{{cite news|title=American Express commercial featuring Mel Blanc|oclc=715152953}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-04/entertainment/ca-1757_1_dance-studio |title=Cynthia Gregory At 40: 'I Did It The Hard Way' |last=Perlmutter |first=Donna |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 4, 1987 |accessdate=May 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420185049/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-04/entertainment/ca-1757_1_dance-studio |archive-date=April 20, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> A typical ad for the American Express Card began with a celebrity asking viewers: "Do you know me?"

===C F. Frost===
Many American Express credit card ads feature a sample American Express Card with the name "C. F. Frost" on the front. This is not a fabricated name; Charles F. Frost was an advertising executive at Ogilvy & Mather.<ref>{{cite web |first=Cecil |last=Adams |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_180.html |title=Who is C. F.

===Cause marketing===
American Express was one of the earliest users of [[cause marketing]], to great success.<ref name="forbescause">{{cite journal |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhessekiel/2012/01/31/cause-marketing-leaders-of-the-pack/ |title=Cause Marketing Leaders of the Pack |journal=[[Forbes]] |date=January 31, 2012 |accessdate=August 18, 2013 |last=Hessekiel |first=David |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818053749/http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhessekiel/2012/01/31/cause-marketing-leaders-of-the-pack/ |archive-date=August 18, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an American Express Card, American Express would contribute one penny to the renovation of the [[Statue of Liberty]]. The campaign generated contributions of $1.7&nbsp;million to the Statue of Liberty restoration project. What would soon capture the attention of marketing departments of major corporations was that the promotion generated approximately a 28% increase in American Express card usage by consumers.

In May 2007, American Express launched an initiative called the Members Project.<ref>[http://www.membersproject.com "Members Project from American Express"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405122736/http://www.membersproject.com/ |date=April 5, 2009 }}.

In April 1986, American Express moved its headquarters to the 51-story [[Three World Financial Center]] in New York City. After [[September 11 attacks|the events of September 11, 2001]], American Express had to leave its headquarters temporarily because it was located directly opposite the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] and was damaged during the fall of the towers. The company began gradually moving back into its rehabilitated building in 2002.

The company maintains major offices in [[Sunrise, Florida]], [[Salt Lake City]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona]], with its main [[data center]]s in [[North Carolina]] and Phoenix.

AMEX Bank of Canada was founded in 1853, in Toronto. It currently{{when|date=August 2019}} has 3,000 employees in its head office at Sheppard, east of Highway 404 in [[Toronto]] (relocated from [[Markham, Ontario]], a northern suburb of Toronto where it resided from 1985 to 2015), as well as an office in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. The company began operations as a bank on July 1, 1990, following an [[order-in-council]] made by the [[Brian Mulroney]] government on November 21, 1988. This decision was not without controversy as federal banking policy at the time would not ordinarily have permitted American Express to operate as a bank.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Newman| first=Peter C.| date=July 30, 1990| title=The brash new kid on the block| journal=[[Maclean's]]| volume=103| number=31| page=33}}</ref>  It is a member of the [[Canadian Bankers Association]] (CBA) and a registered member of the [[Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (CDIC), the federal agency insuring deposits at all of Canada's chartered banks.

American Express has several offices in the UK, including a European Service Center in the [[Carlton Hill, Brighton|Carlton Hill]] area of [[Brighton]], England. The building was completed in 2012. It replaced American Express's former building, Amex House, a large white tower block built in 1977 and surrounded by several other smaller offices around the city.<ref name="Collis9">{{cite book| last=Collis| first=Rose| others=(based on the original by Tim Carder)| title=The New Encyclopaedia of Brighton| edition=1st| year=2010| publisher=Brighton & Hove Libraries| location=Brighton| isbn=978-0-9564664-0-2| page=9}}</ref>  The American Express European Service Center deals with card servicing, sales, fraud and merchant servicing. Official Europe, Middle East, and Africa HQ is located in the [[Belgravia]] district of Westminster, in [[central London]], at Belgrave House on Buckingham Palace Road, SW1; other UK offices are based in [[Sussex]] at [[Burgess Hill]]. In November 2009, [[Brighton and Hove]] City Council granted planning permission for American Express to redevelop the Amex House site.

Japan, Asia-Pacific, and Australian Headquarters is co-located in Singapore, at [[Collyer Quay|16 Collyer Quay]], and in [[Sydney]]'s [[King Street Wharf]] area.

The headquarters of Latin America and [[Caribbean]] division is in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]].

American Express also has a significant presence in India. Its two centers are located at [[Gurgaon]], [[Haryana]] and on Mathura Road in [[New Delhi]]. The Indian operations of American Express revolve around the [[back office]] customer services operations apart from the credit card business for the domestic Indian Economy, arguably the American Express campus in Gurgaon is the largest employee location by headcount for Amex and supports business continuity objectives of Amex including during Hurricane Sandy, the center works 24/7 and includes a co-located second building which was recently{{when|date=September 2019}} transferred to a third party service provider but does much work for Amex.
