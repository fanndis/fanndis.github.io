==History==
The party was established by a retired army officer, [[Hussain Mohammad Ershad]] on 1 January 1986. He was the [[Chief of Army Staff (Bangladesh)|Chief of Army Staff]] of [[Bangladesh Army]]. He had seized power through a [[1982 Bangladesh coup d'état|coup d'état on 24 March 1982]]. He ruled the country as chief martial law administrator till December 1983. Politics was banned during the state of emergency imposed by Ershad, when Justice [[A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury]] was appointed [[President of Bangladesh]]. The Janadal Party was formed under the leadership of [[A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury]], through Ershads declaration of the 19-point programme on 17 March 1983.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Jatiya_Party|title=Jatiya Party|website=Banglapedia}}</ref>

Chowdhury announced the formation of Janadal on 27 November 1983. Chowdhury was the convenor and [[M.A. Matin (politician)|MA Matin]] as general secretary. When Ershad became president, [[Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury]] was named chairman and [[Riazuddin Ahmed]] (Bhola Miah) the general secretary. Ershad formed a second political party, Jatiya Front, under the Bangladesh Nationalist Party politician [[Shah Azizur Rahman]], with members of Janadal and Muslim League, the [[Ganatantri Dal]], United Peoples Party. [[Moudud Ahmed]], and [[Anwar Hossain Manju]] joined Jatiya Front. The front was dissolved in six months and a new political party called Jatiya Party was formed on 1 January 1986 with Ershad as its chairman.<ref name=":0"/>

On 7 May 1986 elections, the Jatiya Party won 153 seats in the national elections. The election was viewed as neither neutral nor fair. On 15 October 1986, Ershad was elected President of Bangladesh. Protests for democracy gained momentum in 1987. Consequently, Ershad dissolved the Jatiya Sangsad on 6 December 1987. In the elections for the fourth Jatiya Sangsad held on 3 March 1988, the Jatiya Party secured 251 seats, while other major political parties, including the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party|BNP]] and the [[Awami League]], boycotted the election. Ershad resigned on December 1990 in the face of rising protest and international pressure.<ref name=":0"/>

Ershad handed power over to Justice [[Shahabuddin Ahmed]], on 6 December 1991. Ershad was arrested, and his deputy, Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury became the acting chairman. On 27 February 1991 national election, the Jatiya Party won the third largest number of seats, 35 seats in the parliament. Jatiya Party won 32 seats in the parliamentary elections held on 12 June 1996 under the [[caretaker government]] (CTG). Jatiya Party joined the [[Bangladesh Awami League]] led cabinet. Anwar Hossain Manju, the secretary general of Jatiya, was included in the cabinet of [[Sheikh Hasina]] as Minister of Communication. Jatiya party splintered in three groups by 2000, this fraction was led by General Ershad, another led by [[Jatiya Party (Manju)|Anwar Hossain Manju]] and [[Bangladesh Jatiya Party]] led by [[Naziur Rahman Manzur]]. In the 2001 parliamentary election the fraction led by Ershad won 14 seats,while the fraction led by Anwar Hossain won one seat.<ref name=":0"/> 2014 Election was a controversial election for Jatiya Party where Ershad's spokesperson [[Bobby Hajjaj]] publicly declared that Jatiya Party would not participate in the election. After the 2014 election, Ershad became the special envoy of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the Bangladesh Awami League led government. Jatiya Party became the opposition party and [[Rowshan Ershad]], Ershad's wife, became the leader of the opposition.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2017/03/27/new-high-court-bench-assigned-to-hear-ershads-appeal-in-1991-graft-case|title=New High Court bench assigned to hear Ershad's appeal in 1991 graft case|work=bdnews24.com|date=27 March 2017}}</ref> Despite being in the opposion party some leaders of Jatiya Party are also in the government cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/opinion/news/142079/Dangers-of-inter-and-intra-party-violence|title=Dangers of inter and intra party violence|work=Prothom Alo|date=13 March 2017|access-date=5 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817162655/http://en.prothom-alo.com/opinion/news/142079/Dangers-of-inter-and-intra-party-violence|archive-date=17 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In January 2016, Ershad's brother, [[GM Quader]], was made vice chairman of the party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bdnews24.com/politics/2016/01/17/ershad-makes-brother-gm-quader-jatiya-party-co-chairman|title=Ershad makes brother GM Quader Jatiya Party co-chairman|work=bdnews24.com|date=17 January 2016}}</ref> On April 2016 Ershad appointed Rowshan as the vice-chairman of the party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bdnews24.com/politics/2016/04/28/ershad-makes-raushon-senior-co-chairman-of-jatiya-party|title=Ershad makes Raushon senior co-chairman of Jatiya Party|work=bdnews24.com|date=28 April 2016}}</ref> In March 2017, Ershad indicated he might form a new political alliance with 14 other parties.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/jatiya-party-float-new-alliance-soon-1372636|title=Jatiya Party to float new alliance soon|date=8 March 2017|work=The Daily Star}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/143823/Will-form-another-grand-alliance-Ershad|title=Will form another grand alliance: Ershad|work=Prothom Alo|date=30 March 2017|access-date=5 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817163157/http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/143823/Will-form-another-grand-alliance-Ershad|archive-date=17 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For the next general election however, the Jatiya Party under HM Ersahad has formed a 58 party grand alliance of its own.
