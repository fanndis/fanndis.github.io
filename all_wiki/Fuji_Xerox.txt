==History==
Fuji Xerox was established in 1962 as a 50:50 partnership with [[Rank Xerox]].  Rank Xerox was absorbed into Xerox Corporation in 1997.

Originally only a distributor of Rank Xerox products, Fuji Xerox later began to research and develop its own [[xerographic]] machines and other devices, beginning with the 2200 [[photocopier]] in 1973.  Today the company is responsible for the innovation and manufacture of many of the colour printing devices sold by Xerox Corporation.  Its innovations include the world's first [[multifunction printer|multifunction printer/copier]], the "Xero Printer 100", launched in 1987.

Fuji Xerox expanded into Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia in 1982 by purchasing distribution rights from Xerox Corporation, it established a subsidiary company Fuji Xerox Asia Pacific Pte headquartered in Singapore. Fuji Xerox Australia Pty Ltd is Australia's No.1 Document Printing and Copying company in the country. It is also the highest performing Fuji Xerox subsidiary in Asia. Its first dealership was NQBE in [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], [[North Queensland]].

Xerox Corporation transferred its [[China]]/[[Hong Kong]] operations to Fuji Xerox in 2000 and Fuji Photo Film Co. raised its stake in the venture to 75% in 2001.<ref>[http://www.fujixerox.com/eng/company/profile/history/corporate.html Corporate History] Retrieved on February 4, 2014</ref>
