'''Citibank''' (styled as '''citibank''') is the consumer division of [[financial services]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[Citigroup]].<ref>[http://www.citigroup.com/citi/fixedincome/data/corp_struct.pdf Citigroup Material Legal Entities]</ref> Citibank was founded in 1812 as the City Bank of New York, and later became First National City Bank of New York.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Citigroup {{!}} American company|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Citigroup|access-date=2020-06-30|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> The bank has 2,649 [[branch (banking)|branches]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} in 19 countries,{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} including 723 branches in the [[United States]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} and 1,494 branches in [[Mexico]] operated by its subsidiary [[Banamex]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} The U.S. branches are concentrated in six metropolitan areas: [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Miami]].<ref name="10K" /> Aside from the U.S. and Mexico, most of the company's branches are in [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[India]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

As a result of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]] and huge losses in the value of its [[Subprime lending|subprime mortgage]] assets, Citigroup, the parent of Citibank, received a [[bailout]] in the form of an investment from the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Citigroup secures government lifeline - Nov. 23, 2008|url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/11/23/news/companies/citigroup/index.htm|access-date=2020-06-30|website=money.cnn.com}}</ref> On November 23, 2008, in addition to an initial investment of $25 billion, a further $20 billion was invested in the company along with guarantees for risky assets of $306 billion.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/23/AR2008112301864_pf.html| title=Government unveils bold plan to rescue Citigroup| first=Jeannine | last=Aversa| agency=[[Associated Press]]| newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]| date=November 24, 2008}}</ref> The guarantees were issued at a time markets were not confident Citi had enough liquidity to cover losses from those investments. Eventually, the Citi shares the Treasury took over in return for the guarantees it issued were booked as net profit for the treasury as Citi had enough liquidity and guarantees did not have to be used. By 2010, Citibank had repaid the loans from the Treasury in full, including interest, resulting in a net profit for the U.S. federal government.

The City Bank of New York was founded on June 16, 1812.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1873125,00.html|title=Citibank: Teetering Since 1812| last=Fox| first=Justin| date=January 21, 2009| journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=January 20, 2018| language=en-US| issn=0040-781X}}</ref> The first president of the City Bank was the statesman and retired Colonel, [[Samuel Osgood]]. After Osgood's death in August 1813, [[William Few]] became President of the bank, staying until 1817, followed by Peter Stagg (1817–1825), Thomas Smith (1825–1827), [[Isaac Wright]] (1827–1832), and [[Thomas Bloodgood]] (1832–1843). [[Moses Taylor]] assumed ownership and management of the bank in 1837. During Taylor's ascendancy, the bank functioned largely as a treasury and finance center for Taylor's own extensive business empire.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/details/citibank181219700000clev| url-access=registration| title=Citibank, 1812–1970| publisher=Harvard University Press| first=Harold| last=van B.

In 1831, City Bank was the site of one of [[1831 City Bank of New York theft|America's first bank heists]] when two thieves made off with tens of thousands of dollars' worth of bank notes, and 398 [[doubloon|gold doubloons]].<ref name="CityBankRobber">{{cite news| title=City Bank Robber Taken|agency=New York Commercial Advertiser| newspaper=[[Hartford Courant|Connecticut Courant]]| date=April 5, 1831| id={{ProQuest|548536442}}}}</ref><ref>[http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2013/03/16/history/post-perspective/first-bank-robbery-in-united-states.html America’s (Not Quite) First Bank Robbery], Jeff Nilsson, ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', March 16, 2013</ref>

The bank also has the distinguishable history of financing war bonds for the [[War of 1812]], serving as a founding member of the financial clearinghouse in New York (1853), underwriting the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], during the [[American Civil War]] with $50 million in war bonds, opens the first foreign exchange department of any bank (1897), and received a $5 million deposit to be given to Spain for the US acquisition of the [[Philippines]] (1899). In 1865, the bank joined the national banking system of the United States under the [[National Bank Act]] and became The [[National City Bank Building|National City Bank]] of New York. By 1868, it was one of the largest banks in the United States, by 1893 it was the largest bank in New York, and the following year it was the largest within the United States. It would help finance the Panama Canal in 1904. By 1906, 11 percent of the federal government's bank balances were held by National City. National City at this time was the banker of [[Standard Oil]], and the Chicago banking factions accused US Secretary of the Treasury [[L. M. Shaw|Leslie Shaw]] of being too close with National City and other Wall Street operators.<ref name="Lowenstein">{{cite book|first=Roger|last=Lowenstein|title=America's Bank: The Epic Struggle to Create the Federal Reserve|publisher=Penguin Press|date=2015|location=New York|isbn=9781594205491|p=53}}</ref>  In 1907, Stillman, then the bank's chairman, would intervene, along with [[J. P. Morgan]] and [[George Fisher Baker]], in the [[Panic of 1907]].

When the [[Federal Reserve Act]] allowed it,<ref>{{cite news |title=Extending our Foreign Commerce |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n54/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=July 13, 1914 |accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref> National City Bank became the first U.S. national bank to open an overseas banking office when it opened a branch in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, in 1914. Many of Citi's present international offices are older; offices in London, Shanghai, [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], and elsewhere were opened in 1901 and 1902 by the '''International Banking Corporation''' (IBC), a company chartered to conduct banking business outside the U.S., which was forbidden to U.S. national banks. In 1918, IBC became a wholly owned subsidiary and was subsequently merged into the bank. The same year, the bank evacuated all of its employees from [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] as the [[Russian Civil War]] had begun, but also established a branch in [[Puerto Rico]]. By 1919, the bank had become the first U.S. bank to have $1 billion in assets.

As of March 9, 1921, there were four national banks in New York City operating branch offices: Catham and Phoenix National, the [[Mechanics and Metals National Bank|Mechanics and Metals National]], the [[Irving Trust|Irving National]], and National City Bank.<ref name=citybank>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1921/03/09/archives/national-city-bank-buys-a-state-bank-negotiations-about-completed.html| title=National City Bank Buys a State Bank| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| page=24| date=March 9, 1921}}</ref>

[[Charles E. Mitchell]], also called "Sunshine" Charlie Mitchell, was elected president in 1921. In 1929, he was made chairman, a position he held until 1933. Under Mitchell, the bank expanded rapidly and by 1930 had 100 branches in 23 countries outside the United States. The policies pursued by the bank under Mitchell's leadership are seen by many people as one of the prime causes of the stock market crash of 1929, which led ultimately to the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2tkicC0evk| title=The Crash of 1929 PBS Documentary| work=[[PBS]]| publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/01/youre_under_arrest_for_causing_the_great_depression.html| title=You're Under Arrest … for Causing the Great Depression: Very few people have been punished for the 2008 financial collapse.

In 1933, a Senate committee, the [[Pecora Commission]], investigated Mitchell for his part in tens of millions of dollars in losses, excessive pay, and tax avoidance, later leading to his resignation.<ref>[http://njch.org/humanities-connection/the-hellhound-of-wall-street/ The Hellhound of Wall Street: Michael Perino on Ferdinand Pecora and the Great Depression] New Jersey Council of the Humanities.</ref><ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/can-angelides-panel-bring-justice-wall-street-79615 Can Angelides Panel Bring Justice to Wall Street?] ''[[Newsweek]]''.</ref><ref>{{cite episode| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/were-bankers-jailed-in-past-financial-crises/| title=Were Bankers Jailed In Past Financial Crises?| network=PBS| series=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]| date=January 22, 2013| first=Jason M.| last=Breslow}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2013-05-24/when-the-senate-went-after-wall-street When the Senate Went After Wall Street] ''[[Bloomberg News#Bloomberg View]]''.</ref><ref>{{cite journal| url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/h/humfig/11217607.0001.203?view=text;rgn=main| title=The Taming of Economic Aristocracies| last=Blomert| first=Reinhart| volume=1| issue=2| journal=Human Figurations| date=July 2012| publisher=[[University of Michigan]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/blt/2016/06/12_dravis.html| title=Corporate Governance&nbsp;– Woven into the Fabric of Capitalism| journal=Business Law Today| last=Davis| first=Bruce| date=June 2016| publisher=[[American Bar Association]]}}</ref> Senator [[Carter Glass]] said of him: "Mitchell, more than any 50 men, is responsible for this [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock crash]]."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,745272-1,00.html Damnation of Mitchell] ''Time'' 1929.</ref><ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2009/07/guest-post-review-of-ferdinand-pecoras.html| title=Guest Post: Review of Ferdinand Pecora's "Wall Street Under Oath"| journal=[[Naked Capitalism]]| date=July 19, 2009}}</ref>

On December 24, 1927, its headquarters in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, were blown-up by the [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchist]] [[Severino Di Giovanni]], in the frame of the international campaign supporting [[Sacco and Vanzetti]].<ref>{{cite book| last=Aliano| first=David| title=Mussolini's National Project in Argentina| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=myEsAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA131| publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]]| page=131| isbn=978-1611475777| date=August 31, 2012}}</ref>

In 1940 and 1941, branches in Germany and Japan closed. In 1945, the bank handled $5.6 billion in Treasury securities for War and Victory Loan drives for the U.S. government.

In 1952, [[James Stillman Rockefeller]] was elected president and then chairman in 1959, serving until 1967. Stillman was a direct descendant of the [[Rockefeller family]] through the [[William Rockefeller]] (the brother of [[John D. Rockefeller|John D.]]) branch. In 1960, his second cousin, [[David Rockefeller]], became president of [[Chase Bank|Chase Manhattan Bank]], National City's long-time New York rival for dominance in the banking industry in the United States.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1469477/James-Stillman-Rockefeller.html| title=Obituaries: James Stillman Rockefeller| newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| date=August 16, 2004| location=[[London]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/11/business/james-s-rockefeller-102-dies-was-a-banker-and-a-24-olympian.html| title=James S.

Following its merger with the First National Bank in 1955, the bank changed its name to The First National City Bank of New York, then shortened it to First National City Bank in 1962. It is also worth noting that the bank began recruiting at [[Harvard Business School]] in 1957, arranged the financing of the 1958 Hollywood film, ''[[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]]'', and had its branches in Cuba [[Nationalization|nationalized]] in 1959 by the new [[Socialism|socialist]] government, and has its first [[African Americans|African-American]] director in 1969, [[Franklin A. Thomas]].

The company organically entered the leasing and credit card sectors, and its introduction of US dollar-denominated [[Certificate of deposit|certificates of deposit]] in London marked the first new [[negotiable instrument]] in the market since 1888. Later to become part of [[MasterCard]], the bank introduced its ''[[First National City Charge Service]]'' credit card—popularly known as the "Everything Card"—in 1967.

In 1967, [[Walter Wriston|Walter B. Wriston]] became chairman and chief executive officer of the bank.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25323-2005Jan20.html| title=Walter B.

In 1967, First National City Bank reorganized as a one-bank holding company, First National City Corporation, or "Citicorp" for short. However, the bank had been nicknamed "Citibank" since the 1860s, when City Bank of New York adopted it as an eight-letter wire code address. "Citicorp" became the holding company's formal name in 1974, and in 1976, First National City Bank was renamed Citibank, N.A.<ref name="RefBiz">[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/citigroup-inc-history/ Citigroup] at Reference for Business</ref> The name change also helped to avoid confusion in [[Ohio]] with [[Cleveland]]-based [[National City Corp.]], though the banks never had any significant overlapping areas except for Citi credit cards issued in National City territory. In addition, at the time of the name change to Citicorp, in 1968, National City of Ohio was mostly a Cleveland-area bank and had not gone on its acquisition spree that would occur in the 1990s and 2000s. Any possible name confusion had Citi not changed its name from National City eventually became completely moot when [[PNC Financial Services]] acquired National City in 2008 during the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].

In 1987, the bank set aside $3 billion in reserves for loan losses in Brazil and other [[Developing country|developing countries]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/15/business/bank-of-boston-in-big-write-off-of-latin-loans.html| title=Bank of Boston In Big Write-Off Of Latin Loans| first=Eric N.| last=Berg| newspaper=The New York Times| date=December 15, 1987}}</ref> In 1990, the bank established a subsidiary in Poland. In 1994, it became the world's biggest card issuer.

===Automated banking card===
Also in the 1980s, the bank launched the Citicard, which allowed customers to perform all transactions without a [[passbook]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The bankers that define the decades: John Reed, Citibank|url=https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1fpt94q2k4c10/the-bankers-that-define-the-decades-john-reed-citibank|access-date=2020-06-30|website=Euromoney|language=en}}</ref> Branches also had [[Computer terminal|terminals]] with simple one-line displays that allowed customers to get basic account information without a [[bank teller]].

===Credit card business===
In the 1960s the bank entered into the credit card business. In 1965, First National City Bank bought [[Diners Club International#Carte Blanche|Carte Blanche]] from [[Hilton Worldwide|Hilton Hotels]]. Three years later, the bank (under pressure from the U.S. government) sold this division. By 1968, the company created its own credit card. The card, known as "[[The Everything Card]]", was promoted as a kind of East Coast version of the [[BankAmericard]]. By 1969, First National City Bank decided that the Everything Card was too costly to promote as an independent brand and joined Master Charge (now [[MasterCard]]). Citibank unsuccessfully tried again from 1977 to 1987 to create a separate credit card brand, the [[Choice (credit card)|Choice Card]].

[[John S. Reed]] was selected CEO in 1984, and Citi became a founding member of the [[CHAPS]] [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] in London. Under his leadership, the next 14 years would see Citibank become the largest bank in the United States, the largest issuer of credit cards and charge cards in the world, and expand its global reach to over 90 countries.

As the bank's expansion continued, the Narre Warren-Caroline Springs{{Dubious|date=February 2018|reason=This credit card company name sounds made up. Narre Warren and Caroline Springs are the names of two outer-Melbourne suburbs.}} credit card company was purchased in 1981. In 1981, Citibank chartered a [[South Dakota]] subsidiary to take advantage of new laws that raised the state's maximum permissible [[interest rate]] on loans to 25% (then the highest in the nation). In many other states, usury laws prevented banks from charging interest that aligned with the extremely high costs of lending money in the late 1970s and early 1980s, making [[consumer lending]] unprofitable. Currently, there is no maximum interest rate or usury restriction under South Dakota law when a written agreement is formed.<ref>[http://sdlegislature.gov/statutes/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=54-3-1.1 South Dakota Statutes 54-3-1.1: Rate of Interest]</ref> As of 2013, Citibank employed 2,900 people in [[Sioux Falls]], South Dakota and contributed to the state holding more bank assets than any other state.<ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/07/how-citibank-made-south-dakota-the-top-state-in-the-us-for-business/425661/ The Atlantic: How Citibank Made South Dakota the Top State in the U.S. for Business]</ref>

In 2005, Federated Department Stores (now [[Macy's, Inc.]]), sold its consumer credit portfolio to Citigroup, which reissued its cards under the name Department Stores National Bank (DSNB).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-06-03/business/0506030188_1_card-portfolio-credit-card-lord-taylor| title=Department store credit business sold to Citigroup| newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]| date=June 3, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/2005/05/30/daily22.html| title=Federated to sell credit card business for $4.5 billion| first=Lisa Biank| last=Fasig| newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Cincinnati Business Courier]]| date=June 2, 2005| url-access=subscription}}</ref>

On April 1, 2016, Citigroup became the exclusive issuer of [[Costco]]'s branded credit cards.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-costco-visa-20160623-snap-story.html| title=Costco's launch of new Citi Visa card leaves angry customers on hold| first=Ellen| last=Cannon|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date=June 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-costco-visa-20150302-story.html| title=Costco names Citi, Visa as new credit card partners after AmEx deal ends| first=Javier| last=Panzar | newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=March 2, 2015}}</ref>

The bank's private-label credit card division, Citi Retail Services, issues store-issued credit cards for such companies as: [[American Airlines]], [[Best Buy]], [[ConocoPhillips]], [[Costco]], [[ExxonMobil]], [[The Home Depot]], [[Sears]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Oil]], [[Staples Inc.]] and until January 2018, [[Hilton Hotels & Resorts]].

===Early technology ===

====Automatic teller machines====
In the 1970s, Citibank was one of the first U.S. banks to introduce [[Automated teller machine|automatic teller machines]] (ATMs), which gave customers 24-hour access to cash. In April 2006, the firm signed a deal with [[7-Eleven]] to offer Citibank customers free access to ATMs in more than 5,500 convenience stores in the United States. The 7-Eleven deal ended in 2017.<ref>{{cite press release| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060404005219/en/Citibank-7-Eleven-Sign-Agreement-Offer-Free-ATM| title=Citibank and 7-Eleven, Inc.

The Citibank.com [[domain name]] was registered in 1991, and initially used only for email and other internet interactions.<ref>[http://www.whois.com/whois/citibank.com Whois: citibank.com]</ref> As early as 1982, Citibank pioneered online access to accounts using 300-[[baud]] [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up]] only.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.atarimania.com/utility-atari-400-800-xl-xe-homebase_13760.html | title=Screenshot: Citibank Home Base}}{{better source|date=November 2017}}</ref> At first, access was through proprietary software distributed on a 5.25-inch [[floppy disk]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Following the creation of the [[World Wide Web]], the bank offered [[Web browser|browser]]-based access as well.
