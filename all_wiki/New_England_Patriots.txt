The '''New England Patriots''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in the [[Greater Boston]] area. They compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member team of the league's [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC East|East]] division. The team plays its home games at [[Gillette Stadium]] in the town of [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], which is located {{convert|22|mi|km}}<ref>https://www.distance-cities.com/distance-boston-ma-to-foxboro-ma</ref> southwest of downtown [[Boston]]. The Patriots are also headquartered at Gillette Stadium.

Founded in 1959 as the '''Boston Patriots''', an original member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), the team joined the NFL in the leagues' [[AFL–NFL merger|1970 merger]], then changed its name when it [[relocation of professional sports teams|moved]] to Foxborough in 1971. The New England Patriots played their home games at [[Foxboro Stadium]] through 2001, then moved to Gillette Stadium at the start of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]]. The Patriots' [[Jets–Patriots rivalry|rivalry]] with the [[New York Jets]] is considered one of the most bitter [[National Football League rivalries|rivalries]] in the NFL.

Since the arrival of head coach [[Bill Belichick]] and [[quarterback]] [[Tom Brady]] in 2000, the Patriots have become one of the most successful teams in NFL history, having claimed 16 AFC East titles as part of 18 consecutive winning seasons since 2001. The franchise has since set numerous notable records, including most wins in a ten-year period (126, in 2003–2012), an undefeated 16-game regular season in 2007 – the longest [[winning streak (sports)|winning streak]] consisting of regular season and playoff games in NFL history (a 21-game streak from October 2003 to October 2004), and the most consecutive division titles won by a team in NFL history (11 straight division titles from 2009 to 2019). The team owns the record for most [[Super Bowl]] appearances (nine) and wins (six) by a [[Tom Brady and Bill Belichick era|head coach–quarterback tandem]], most conference championships overall (11), most Super Bowl appearances overall (11). The Patriots are tied with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] for the most Super Bowl wins (six), and with the [[Denver Broncos]] for the most Super Bowl losses (five).

[[File:New England Patriots logo old.svg|left|thumb|upright|"Pat Patriot" logo, used through 1992]]
On November 16, 1959, [[Boston]] business executive [[Billy Sullivan (American football)|Billy Sullivan]] was awarded the eighth and final franchise of the developing [[American Football League]] (AFL). The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team's official name. The most popular choice – and the one that Sullivan selected – was the "Boston Patriots," with "[[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]]" referring to those colonists of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] who rebelled against [[British Empire|British]] control during the [[American Revolution]] and in July [[1776]] declared the [[United States of America]] an independent nation. Immediately thereafter, artist Phil Bissell of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' developed the "[[Pat Patriot]]" logo.<ref name="PatsHistory">{{cite web|title=Historical Dates – Patriots History|url=http://www.patriots.com/team/history/historical-dates|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Patriots.com|date=August 28, 2015|accessdate=November 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606193041/http://www.patriots.com/team/history/historical-dates|archive-date=June 6, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Patriots struggled for most of their years in the AFL, and they never had a regular home stadium. [[Nickerson Field]], [[Harvard Stadium]], [[Fenway Park]], and [[Boston College]]'s [[Alumni Stadium]] all served as home fields during their time in the American Football League. They played in only one [[American Football League playoffs|AFL championship game]], following the [[1963 AFL season|1963 season]], in which they lost to the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] [[1963 American Football League Championship Game|51–10]]. They did not appear again in an AFL or NFL [[NFL playoffs|post-season]] game for another 13 years.<ref name="PatsHistory" />

When the NFL and AFL [[AFL–NFL merger|merged in 1970]], the Patriots were placed in the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC East|East]] division, where they still play today.<ref name="PatsHistory" /> The following year, the Patriots moved to a [[Foxboro Stadium|new stadium]] in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]], which would serve as their home for the next 30 years. As a result of the move, they announced they would change their name from the '''Boston Patriots''' to the '''Bay State Patriots''', after the state of [[Massachusetts]].<ref name="PatsTrivia">{{cite news|last=Palma|first=Briana|title=How much do you know about the Patriots?|url=http://www.patriots.com/news/2015/04/22/how-much-do-you-know-about-patriots|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Patriots.com|date=April 22, 2015|accessdate=November 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115183030/http://www.patriots.com/news/2015/04/22/how-much-do-you-know-about-patriots|archive-date=November 15, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The name was rejected by the NFL and on March 22, 1971, the team officially announced they would change its geographic name to '''New England'''.<ref name="PatsHistory" />

During the 1970s, the Patriots had some success, earning a berth to the playoffs in 1976—as a [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team—and in 1978—as AFC East champions. They lost in the first round both times. In 1985, they returned to the playoffs, and made it all the way to [[Super Bowl XX]], which they lost to the [[Chicago Bears]] 46–10. Following their Super Bowl loss, they returned to the playoffs in 1986, but lost in the first round. The team would not make the playoffs again for eight more years. During the 1990 season, the Patriots went 1–15. They changed ownership three times in the ensuing 14 years, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by [[Victor Kiam]] in 1988, who sold the team to [[James Orthwein]] in 1992. Though Orthwein's period as owner was short and controversial, he did oversee major changes to the team, first with the hiring of former [[New York Giants]] coach [[Bill Parcells]] in 1993. Orthwein and his marketing team also commissioned the NFL to develop a new visual identity and logo, and changed their primary colors from the traditional red, white and blue to blue and silver for the team uniforms.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/20/sports/sp-plaschke20 |first=Bill |last=Plaschke |authorlink=Bill Plaschke |title=For this dandy doodle, designer was more like a 30-minute man |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 20, 2008 |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref> Orthwein intended to move the team to his native [[St. Louis]] (where it would have been renamed as the [[St. Louis Stallions]]), but instead sold the team in 1994 for $175{{nbsp}}million to Boston paper magnate [[Robert Kraft]], who had bought the Patriots' then-home, [[Foxboro Stadium]], out of bankruptcy in 1988.<ref name="PatsHistory" />

Since then, the Patriots have sold out every preseason, regular season, and playoff home game.<ref name="PatsHistory" /> By 2009, the value of the franchise had increased by over $1{{nbsp}}billion, to a ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine estimated value of $1.361{{nbsp}}billion, third highest in the NFL only behind the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Washington Redskins]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/30/football-values-09_New-England-Patriots_307338.html|title=#3 New England Patriots|work=[[Forbes]]|date=September 2, 2011|accessdate=October 9, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/30/football-values-09_NFL-Team-Valuations_Rank.html|title=NFL Team Valuations|work=[[Forbes]]|date=September 2, 2011|accessdate=October 9, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2011/09/07/the-nfls-most-valuable-teams/ | first = Kurt | last = Badenhausen | work = [[Forbes]] | date = September 7, 2011 | title = The NFL's Most Valuable Teams}}</ref> {{As of|2018|July|df=US}}, the Patriots are the sixth most valuable sports franchise in the world according to ''Forbes'' magazine with a value of $3.7{{nbsp}}billion.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2018/07/18/full-list-the-worlds-50-most-valuable-sports-teams-of-2018/#592a64c66b0e | title = Full List: The World's 50 Most Valuable Sports Teams Of 2018 | first = Kurt | last = Badenhausen | work = [[Forbes]] | date = July 18, 2018 | accessdate = August 26, 2018}}</ref>

Continuing on as head coach under Kraft's ownership, Parcells would bring the Patriots to two playoff appearances, including [[Super Bowl XXXI]], which they lost to the [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] by a score of 35–21. [[Pete Carroll]], Parcells's successor, would also take the team to the playoffs twice in 1997 and 1998 before being dismissed as head coach after the 1999 season.<ref name="PatsHistory" />
[[File:TomBrady.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|[[Tom Brady]] in 2007]]
The Patriots hired head coach [[Bill Belichick]], who had served as defensive coordinator under Parcells including during Super Bowl XXXI, in 2000. Their new home field, [[Gillette Stadium]], opened in [[2002 NFL season|2002]] to replace the aging Foxboro Stadium. Under Belichick and quarterback [[Tom Brady]], the Patriots consistently became one of the most dominant teams in the NFL, with many describing the team as a "[[Brady–Belichick era|dynasty]]". Within the first few seasons of the 21st century, the team won three Super Bowls in four seasons ([[Super Bowl XXXVI|2001]], [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|2003]], and [[Super Bowl XXXIX|2004]]), over the [[St. Louis Rams]], [[Carolina Panthers]], and [[Philadelphia Eagles]], respectively. The Patriots finished the [[2007 NFL season|2007 regular season]] with a perfect 16–0 record, becoming only the fourth team in league history to go undefeated in the regular season, and the only one since the league expanded its [[regular season (NFL)|regular season]] schedule to 16 games.<ref name="PatsHistory" /> After advancing to [[Super Bowl XLII]], the team's fourth Super Bowl in seven years, the Patriots were defeated by the [[2007 New York Giants season|Giants]] to end their bid for a 19–0 season. With the loss, the Patriots ended the year at 18–1, becoming only one of three teams to go 18–1 along with the [[1984 San Francisco 49ers season|1984 San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]]. However, both the Bears and 49ers lost their only game during the regular season, and both would win their respective Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2017/09/06/patriots-nfl-teams-near-unbeaten-regular-seasons/619391001/ |title=13 NFL teams that came closest to unbeaten regular seasons |website=[[USA Today]] |access-date=February 8, 2019}}</ref>

[[File:New England Patriots wordmark (1960 - 1992).png|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Patriots wordmark used between 1960 and 1992.]]
The Patriots original helmet logo was a simple [[tricorne]] hat, used only for the 1960 season. From 1961 to 1992, the Patriots used a logo of a [[minuteman|Revolutionary War minuteman]] hiking a football. The Patriots script logo during this time consisted of a western-style font. The minuteman logo became known as the "[[Pat Patriot]]" logo, which later became the name of the team's mascot.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fiske|first=Angelique|title=Patriots Hall of Fame history lesson: Evolution of the logo, uniform and name|url=https://www.patriots.com/news/patriots-hall-of-fame-history-lesson-evolution-of-the-logo-uniform-and-name|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Patriots.com|date=February 21, 2020|access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref><ref name="NESN"/>

In 1979, the Patriots worked with [[National Football League Properties|NFL Properties]] to design a new, streamlined logo, to replace the complex Pat Patriot logo. The new logo featured the blue and white profile of a minuteman in a tricorne hat set against a flag showing three red stripes separated by two white stripes. Team owner Billy Sullivan decided to put the new logo up to a vote against Pat Patriot with the fans at the September 23 home game against the [[Los Angeles Chargers|San Diego Chargers]], using a [[sound level meter]] to judge the crowd's reaction. The new logo was decidedly rejected by the crowd in favor of Pat, and the concept was shelved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/story/_/id/6810815/uni-watch-traces-lineage-patriots-flying-elvis-logo|title=The untold story behind the Patriots logo|date=July 28, 2011|publisher=[[ESPN]]|first=Paul|last=Lukas|accessdate=January 24, 2018}}</ref>

In 1993, a new logo was unveiled involving the gray face of a minuteman wearing a red, white and blue hat that begins as a tricorne and transitions into a flowing banner-like design. The logo is a fundamentally identical design to the aborted 1979 logo which the fans booed out of the home stadium: A right facing profile of a silhouetted dull face image and hat with a white star, with red stripes to the left. It became popularly known as the "Flying Elvis" due to many observing its resemblance to the profile of a young [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name="NESN">{{cite news|url=http://nesn.com/2013/07/patriots-uniforms-evolve-from-pat-patriot-to-flying-elvis-throughout-the-years-photos/|title=Patriots' Uniform Evolves From Flying Elvis Over The Years|date=July 20, 2013|publisher=[[NESN]]|accessdate=August 24, 2015}}</ref> In 2000, the blue color was darkened.<ref name="NESN"/>

The new uniforms consisted of a royal blue home jersey and a white away jersey.<ref name="NESN"/> The helmet was silver with the Flying Elvis logo and no additional striping.<ref name="NESN"/> Both uniforms used silver pants, originally with stripes designed to look like those flowing from the Flying Elvis, but these were changed to simple red and blue stripes after one season.

In 1995, the Patriots switched the block numbers to a more modern rounded number font with a dropshadow.<ref name="Uniform History 2"/> The Patriots were one of the first adopters of custom numbers, a trend that would grow drastically over the next 20 years.<ref name="Uniform History 2"/>

However, in 2000, the Patriots also became one of the few teams to drop the rounded numbers and switched back to block numbers.<ref name="Uniform History 2"/> Also that year, the shade of blue was darkened from royal to nautical blue.<ref name="Uniform History 2"/> The Patriots, unsatisfied with the white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, the number on the white jersey was switched from red to blue.<ref name="Uniform History 2"/>

Starting with the 2020 season, the Patriots made some changes to their uniform. The all-blue "[[Color Rush]]" design became the primary home uniform, complete with updated block letters and numbers, and blue/red/white socks. A corresponding white uniform was also unveiled and will also be paired with the blue pants. Both uniforms featured truncated shoulder striping as a nod to the "Pat Patriot" uniforms.<ref name="PatriotsNewUniforms2020" /><ref>{{cite web|title=HISTORY: LOGO AND UNIFORM|url=https://www.patriots.com/press-room/history-logo-uniform|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Patriots.com|access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>

====Alternate uniforms====
In 1994, the Patriots wore the "Pat Patriot" helmets and plain white striped pants from two seasons prior as alternates as part of the NFL's 75th anniversary celebration. In 2002, NFL teams were allowed to add a permanent third jersey to be worn in a maximum of two games. The Patriots reintroduced a red jersey as their alternate, complemented with the old-style "Pat Patriot" helmet.<ref name="NESN"/> In 2003, the Patriots changed their alternate to a silver jersey with blue pants. For this uniform, the "Flying Elvis" helmet was used.<ref name="NESN"/> The uniform was identical to the white jersey with any areas of white replaced by silver. These uniforms were dropped after 2007. No alternate uniform was used in 2008. In 2009, the red alternate was reintroduced, again accompanied by the "Pat Patriot" helmet. An alternate white road jersey was also worn with the older helmet for one game, using red numbers, in tribute to the 50th anniversary of the AFL. The red alternate gained a blue outline around the numbers in 2010 and this was worn through 2012. The Patriots retired their alternate red uniforms in 2013, thanks to a new NFL rule outlawing throwback alternate helmets, and restricting teams to one helmet shell only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1779446-pat-patriot-rip-new-nfl-safety-rule-forbids-alternate-helmets|title=New NFL Safety Rule Forbids Alternate Helmets|date=September 18, 2013|website=Bleacher Report|accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref>

In 2016, the Patriots took part in the [[NFL Color Rush]] program, wearing monochrome navy uniforms on September 22 against the [[Houston Texans]].<ref name="PatsColorRush">{{cite news|last=Fiske|first=Angelique|title=Check out the 2016 Patriots Color Rush Jerseys|url=https://www.patriots.com/news/check-out-the-2016-patriots-color-rush-jerseys-270621|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Patriots.com|date=September 13, 2016|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}</ref> The uniform tops were patterned after the 1980s Pat Patriot-era uniforms, while the pants featured thick white stripes with red accents. They have worn them a total of four times since 2016. In 2017, an all-white Color Rush uniform was introduced and used for the Patriots' Thursday night road game against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].

{{See also|Tom Brady–Peyton Manning rivalry}}
The Patriots rivalry with the [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts]] ran through the two clubs' tenure together in the [[AFC East]] (1970–2001). The two clubs clashed in several close games, such as on December 19, 1971, as a late Patriots touchdown decided a 21–17 New England win; on September 18, 1978, the Colts rallied to defeat the Patriots 34–27 on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' on a virtual one-man scoring rampage by running back [[Joe Washington]]; on September 4, 1983, the Colts defeated the Patriots in overtime 29–23 in their final season in Baltimore.<ref name="Pats vs Colts Boxscores"/> The Patriots defeated the Colts in back-to-back overtime games, 23–17 on December 8, 1991, and 37–34 on November 15, 1992.<ref name="Pats vs Colts Boxscores">{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_query.cgi?tm1=clt&tm2=nwe&yr=all |title=Boxscore finder: Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts vs New England Patriots |work=Pro Football-Reference |publisher=Sports Reference LLC |accessdate=August 24, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907195440/http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_query.cgi?tm1=clt&tm2=nwe&yr=all |archivedate=September 7, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Colts vs Patriots 2011 01.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Pats facing the Colts in 2011]]
Even though the two clubs were placed in separate divisions in the NFL's 2002 divisional realignment, their rivalry did not diminish. At that time, both teams were among the best in the AFC, and both were led by likely Hall of Fame quarterbacks, [[Peyton Manning]] (for the Colts) and [[Tom Brady]] (for the Patriots). The teams met three times in four years (2003, 2004, 2006) in the playoffs, with the winner going on to win that season's [[Super Bowl]] each time. The Manning portion of the rivalry began in Manning's rookie season, 1998; in [[1999 Indianapolis Colts season|1999]] Manning suffered a bitter 31–28 loss in September as the Patriots behind [[Drew Bledsoe]] erased a 28–7 Colts lead, then defeated the Patriots 20–15 in Indianapolis on December 12. The Brady–Manning portion of the rivalry began on September 30, 2001, as Brady made his first NFL start in a 44–13 Patriots win at Foxboro; on October 21 the Patriots defeated the Colts at the [[RCA Dome]] 38–17.<ref name="Pats vs Colts Boxscores"/>

After the Colts left the AFC East in 2002, they first met on November 30, 2003, in a 38–34 Patriots win decided on a last-second goal line stand by the Patriots.<ref name="Pats vs Colts Boxscores"/> The Colts broke a six-game Patriot winning streak in the rivalry in November 2005,<ref name="Pats vs Colts Boxscores"/> then won twice in 2006;<ref name="Pats vs Colts Boxscores"/> in the [[AFC Championship Game]] the Colts erased a 21–6 halftime lead; the game lead tied or changed seven times in the second half before a late touchdown led to a 38–34 Colts win. The November 4, 2007, meeting involved both teams being unbeaten to that point; the 8–0 Patriots and the 7–0 Colts. The Patriots rallied to win 24–20.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=271104011 |title=New England Patriots vs. Indianapolis Colts - Recap - November 4, 2007 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=March 22, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016062521/http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=271104011 |archivedate=October 16, 2012}}</ref> The Colts won again in 2008 and then erased a large Patriots lead in 2009's [[4th and 2]] game.

===Buffalo Bills===
{{Main|Bills–Patriots rivalry}}
The Patriots and the [[Buffalo Bills|Bills]] were both charter members of the AFL, and even competed with each other in an AFL playoff game. They have remained divisional rivals since the NFL-AFL merger. Prior to the rise of Tom Brady, the two teams shared a mellow, yet occasionally competitive rivalry, featuring highlights from players such as [[O.J. Simpson]], [[Steve Grogan]], [[Joe Ferguson]], [[Jim Kelly]], and [[Drew Bledsoe]]. However, Brady has dominated the Bills ever since taking over as the Patriots' franchise quarterback, holding a 29-3 regular season record over them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/buffalo-bills/teamvsteam?opp=19%7CBuffalo|title=Buffalo Bills vs. New England Patriots Results - The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com}}</ref> Though Patriots fans usually feel apathetic towards the Bills, Bills fans have come to despise the Patriots more than any other rival.<ref name = "2017primaryrivalpoll">{{cite web|url=https://www.allcounted.com/share?view=summary&cid=stnbvll7tbrir&uid=|title=2017 Buffalo Bills Rivalry Survey|website=www.allcounted.com}}</ref> The rivalry has remained somewhat intense in recent years with multiple players having played for both teams, the Bills usually giving their all when playing the Patriots, and the presence of [[Rex Ryan]], who coached both the Bills and Jets and was known for his trash-talk.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2015/01/14/new-bills-coach-rex-ryan-says-patriots-still-his-top-opponent/UMHEgiH5mYplD6g83RcmEK/story.html|title=New Bills coach Rex Ryan says Patriots still his top target|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|access-date=August 3, 2017}}</ref>

The Patriots first played the [[Miami Dolphins]] in 1966 in the AFL, when Miami was one of two expansion teams to debut that year in that league. The Dolphins dominated the Patriots in the 1970s and 1990s, but the two teams remained competitive with each other for years before the rise of Tom Brady. Brady, however, struggled occasionally against the Dolphins in the 2000s before reasserting dominance in the 2010s. The Patriots and Dolphins are the only two teams in the Super Bowl era to post undefeated regular season records, with Miami [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|going 14-0 in 1972]] and the Patriots [[2007 New England Patriots season|going 16-0 in 2007]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/new-england-patriots/teamvsteam?opp=17|title=New England Patriots vs. Miami Dolphins Results {{!}} The Football Database|website=FootballDB.com|access-date=August 28, 2017}}</ref> Notable moments between the clubs include the [[Snowplow Game]], three playoff matchups, the Dolphins revealing their [[Wildcat formation|Wildcat offense]] against the Patriots,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/dolphins-stun-patriots-38-13/|title=Dolphins stun Patriots 38-13|date=September 22, 2008|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=August 28, 2017}}</ref> and the [[Miracle in Miami]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Miracle in Miami: Dolphins Stun Patriots with Last-Second Touchdown|url=https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/dolphins-stun-patriots-miracle-in-miami-nfl-week-14/|location=Boston|publisher=[[WBZ-TV]]|date=December 9, 2018|access-date=December 9, 2018}}</ref>

Per an interview with the [[WROR-FM#Loren and Wally|Loren & Wally Show on WROR 105.7 FM]] in and around the time of [[Super Bowl XLIX]], said shots use double the load of [[black powder]] than a regular historical reenactor does, specifically 200 grains, in order to be heard throughout the stadium. ESPN writer [[Josh Pahigian]] named this one of the top ten celebrations in the league in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/travel/news/story?id=3139628|title=It's a Celebration: Best NFL Touchdown Rituals|author=Josh Pahigian|date=December 13, 2007|website=ESPN|accessdate=February 19, 2019}}</ref>

==Facilities==
===Stadium===
{{Main|Gillette Stadium}}
[[File:Patriots bills.jpg|thumb|Gillette Stadium, home of the Patriots]]
Since 2002, the Patriots' home stadium has been [[Gillette Stadium]], a $350{{nbsp}}million facility privately financed by Kraft, located in [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]]. It houses all administrative offices for the team and its owning entity, [[The Kraft Group]], as well as the Kraft-owned [[Major League Soccer]] team, the [[New England Revolution]].<ref name="gs">{{cite web|url=http://www.gillettestadium.com/sports|title=Sports|publisher=Gillette Stadium|accessdate=March 2, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302074342/http://www.gillettestadium.com/sports|archivedate=March 2, 2014}}</ref> The field, which was originally natural grass, was replaced with a [[FieldTurf]] surface during the 2006 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldturf.com/en/artificial-turf/artificial-turf-news/patriots-select-fieldturf-for-gillette-stadium|title=Patriots Select FieldTurf for Gillette Stadium|publisher=FieldTurf|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}</ref> The Patriots have a 20-3 playoff record in this stadium as of the conclusion of the [[2018 NFL season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/01/18/all-their-greatness-patriots-havent-won-road-playoff-game-since/ |title=For all of their greatness, the Patriots haven't won a road playoff game since 2007 |work=The Washington Post |date=January 18, 2019 |accessdate=October 28, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Bill Pennington |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/sports/new-england-patriots-playoffs-foxborough-.html |title=Foxboro(ugh!): Where Visiting N.F.L.

Prior to 2002, the Patriots played in [[Foxboro Stadium]] dating back to 1971, the team's second year in the NFL after the AFL–NFL merger, and this venue was also privately funded. The final game in this stadium was the [[Tuck Rule Game|2001 AFC Divisional Playoff game]] which was a 16-13 overtime win over the visiting [[Oakland Raiders]], known for the raging snowstorm and the "tuck rule" call.<ref name="gs"/>

During the team's days in the [[American Football League]] and its first year in the NFL, the Boston Patriots were hosted by a number of fields in or around [[Boston]]—they played at [[Nickerson Field]] (1960–62), [[Fenway Park]] (1963–68), [[Alumni Stadium]] (1969), and [[Harvard Stadium]] (1970).<ref name="gs"/>

===Aircraft===
In 2017 the Patriots purchased two [[Boeing 767]]-300ERs for use as team planes, with one serving as the backup, which were ready in time for the [[2017 NFL season]]. This made them the first team in league history to own their own planes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Breech |first=John |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/look-patriots-show-off-the-inside-of-their-new-team-plane-for-the-first-time/ |title=LOOK: Patriots show off the inside of their new team plane for the first time |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=October 5, 2017 |accessdate=October 28, 2019}}</ref> At the time it was getting more difficult for professional sports teams to book private charter flights, with eight teams being dropped that season, as major commercial airlines were instead focusing on more profitable scheduled flights.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Ryan |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/commercial-airlines-reportedly-drop-8-nfl-teams-but-not-because-of-anthem-protests/ |title=Commercial airlines reportedly drop 8 NFL teams but not because of anthem protests |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=October 1, 2017 |accessdate=October 28, 2019}}</ref> The two jet airliners, N366AA and N39367, were previously operated by [[American Airlines]] from 1991 to 2016.

==Strategy==
{{Further|New England Patriots strategy}}
Under head coach Bill Belichick, the Patriots have employed specific on-field and off-field strategies. On the field, the Patriots have typically used an "[[Ron Erhardt|Erhardt]]–[[Ray Perkins (wide receiver)|Perkins]]" offense and a "[[Chuck Fairbanks|Fairbanks]]–[[Hank Bullough|Bullough]]" [[3–4 defense]], referred to commonly as a two-gap 3–4 defensive system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/packages/nfl2000/plays.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001018154957/http://www.boston.com/sports/packages/nfl2000/plays.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 18, 2000 |title=Coming to terms with the system |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |first=Ron |last=Borges |date=September 1, 2000 |accessdate=October 6, 2009}}</ref> Their philosophy in making personnel decisions and in game planning has focused on the "team" concept,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/other_nfl/view/2009_01_15_New_Chief_in_charge:_Scott_Pioli_starts_life_as_lone_boss_in_Kansas_City/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921042818/http://bostonherald.com/sports/football/other_nfl/view/2009_01_15_New_Chief_in_charge%3A_Scott_Pioli_starts_life_as_lone_boss_in_Kansas_City |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 21, 2012 |work=[[Boston Herald]] |first=Karen |last=Guregian |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=October 6, 2009 |title=Scott Pioli starts life as lone boss in Kansas City}}</ref> stressing preparation, strong work ethic, versatility,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/nfl/20050206-1920-fbn-superbowl-vrabel.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226234414/http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/nfl/20050206-1920-fbn-superbowl-vrabel.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 26, 2008 |title=Versatile Vrabel vaults into Super Bowl lore |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |first=Mark |last=Long |date=February 6, 2005 |accessdate=October 6, 2009}}</ref> and lack of individual ego.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/patriots/2005-01-24-team-concept_x.htm|title=Patriots all about the rings|work=[[USA Today]]|first=Jarrett|last=Bell|date=January 24, 2005|accessdate=October 6, 2009}}</ref> This approach, which has led to six Super Bowl victories under Belichick, was analyzed in the 2004 book ''[[Patriot Reign]]''.

The New England Patriots feature 28 former players and two contributors in their team [[hall of fame]], established in 1991. A committee of media and staff selected 11 players for enshrinement between 1991 and 2001, before a six-year span of no selections. In 2007, in advance of the 2008 opening of [[The Hall at Patriot Place]], the Patriots introduced a new nomination committee to select three candidates, with the winner of an Internet fan vote being enshrined in the hall of fame.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ben Coates elected to Patriots Hall of Fame|url=https://www.patriots.com/news/ben-coates-elected-to-patriots-hall-of-fame-140866|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Patriots.com|date=July 7, 2008|access-date=May 21, 2019}}</ref> In order to be eligible, players and coaches must be retired for at least four years. Beginning in 2011, and meeting every five years, a senior selection committee has the option of voting a player who has been retired for at least 25 seasons into the hall of fame.<ref>{{cite web|title=Selection Process and Committee|url=https://www.patriotshalloffame.com/hall-of-fame/selection-process-and-committee/|website=PatriotsHallofFame.com|access-date=May 21, 2019}}</ref>

==Controversies==

==="Spygate"===
{{Main|Spygate (NFL)}}
During the [[2007 NFL season|2007 season]], the New England Patriots were disciplined by the league for videotaping [[New York Jets]]' defensive coaches' signals from an unauthorized location during a September 9, 2007 game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/patriots/2007-09-12-belichick-apology_N.htm|title=Belichick apologizes for 'Videogate'|last=Pedulla|first=Tom|date=September 12, 2007|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=January 18, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22190391/|title=Jets play innocent, wonder 'What is 'Spygate?'|date=December 10, 2008|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113034635/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22190391/|archivedate=January 13, 2008 |url-status=dead|accessdate=January 18, 2008}}</ref> Videotaping opposing coaches is not illegal in the NFL ''[[de jure]]'', but there are designated areas allowed by the league to do such taping. After an investigation, the NFL fined Patriots head coach [[Bill Belichick]] $500,000 for his role in the incident, fined the Patriots $250,000, and docked the team their original first-round selection in the [[2008 NFL Draft]] which would have been the 31st pick of the draft.<ref name="Ruling">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/09/final_ruling.html|title=Final ruling|last=Reiss|first=Mike|date=September 13, 2007|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=February 18, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011112029/http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/09/final_ruling.html|archivedate=October 11, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==="Deflategate"===
{{Main|Deflategate}}
During the [[2014–15 NFL playoffs#AFC Championship Game: New England Patriots 45, Indianapolis Colts 7|2015 AFC Championship Game]] against the [[Indianapolis Colts]], allegations arose that the Patriots were using under-inflated footballs. It was even suggested that the Patriots' staff themselves deliberately deflated the footballs to give their team an unfair advantage during the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/football/nfl-was-ready-to-check-new-england-patriots-footballs-against-colts-report-says-1.9829583|title=NFL was ready to check New England Patriots' footballs against Colts, report says - Newsday|work=Newsday|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/extra_points/2015/01/report_patriots_may_have_deflated_footballs_for_af.html|title=Report: Colts Raised Concerns About Under-Inflated Balls After Game vs. Patriots in Indianapolis|work=Boston.com|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> A lengthy investigation and heated debate commenced shortly afterwards, with a full report being published in May 2015.<ref name="CNN1">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/22/us/nfl-patriots-deflategate-rules/|title=What the heck is Deflategate anyway?|last=McLaughlin|first=Eliott|date=January 23, 2015|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=January 23, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Wells report">{{cite web|title=Investigative Report Concerning Footballs Used During The Afc Championship Game On January 18, 2015|url=https://nfllabor.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/investigative-and-expert-reports-re-footballs-used-during-afc-championsh.pdf|author=Wells Jr., Theodore V.|publisher=National Football League|date=May 6, 2015|accessdate=May 7, 2015}}</ref> The Wells Report found that balls provided by the Patriots, who were the home team, indeed had less pressure on average than the balls provided by the Colts. Also notable was the findings of some suggestions of communication between [[Tom Brady]] and two Patriots locker room attendants, indicating Brady was likely "generally aware" of the situation and that the Patriots staff intentionally deflated the footballs.<ref name = "Wells report" /> A later study by the [[American Enterprise Institute]] called the evidence and methodology of the Wells report "deeply flawed" and "unreliable".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/on-wells-report/|title=On the Wells Report|work=American Enterprise Institute|accessdate=August 10, 2017}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the incident, the NFL suspended Brady without pay for the first four games of the [[2015 NFL season|2015 season]], fined the Patriots $1{{nbsp}}million, and forced them to forfeit their 2016 first round draft pick and 2017 fourth round draft pick. Brady appealed his suspension, which was eventually vacated by the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], only for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] to reinstate it a year later for the [[2016 NFL season]].<ref name="espn.go.com">{{cite web|title=Tom Brady's four-game suspension upheld|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/15353950/tom-brady-new-england-patriots-four-game-suspension-deflategate-reinstated-appeals-court|website=[[ESPN]]|date=April 25, 2016|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}</ref> Brady eventually agreed to serve the suspension in 2016, but led the Patriots to win [[Super Bowl LI]] in spite of it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201702050atl.htm |title=Super Bowl LI - New England Patriots vs. Atlanta Falcons - February 5th, 2017 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |access-date=December 10, 2017}}</ref>

==Radio and television==

Any preseason games not on national television are shown on [[CBS]]'s [[Owned-and-operated television stations in the United States|O&O]] [[WBZ-TV]], who also airs the bulk of Patriots regular season games by virtue of CBS having the rights to most AFC games; CBS also has a presence at the nearby [[Patriot Place]] with the "CBS Scene" bar/restaurant. During the regular season whenever the Patriots host an NFC team, the games are aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WFXT-TV]], and ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' games are carried by the "NBC Boston" network of stations led by [[WBTS-CD]].<ref name="Patriots Media"/> Preseason games were broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WCVB-TV]] from 1995 until the change to WBZ in 2009 (WCVB continues to simulcast ESPN's ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' games featuring the Patriots).<ref name="Patriots Media"/> [[Don Criqui]] was [[play-by-play]] announcer for the 1995–2012 seasons, with [[Randy Cross]] as a [[color commentator]] and Mike Lynch as a [[sideline reporter]].<ref name="Patriots Media"/> Lynch was replaced by WBZ reporter [[Steve Burton (sports journalist)|Steve Burton]] in 2009.<ref name="Patriots Media"/>
