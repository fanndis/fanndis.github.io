'''Ruprecht Polenz''' (26 May 1946 in [[Grosspostwitz]]) is a [[Germany|German]] [[politician]] and member of the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union (CDU)]] [[political party]].

==Political career==
In the [[1994 German federal election|1994 national elections]], Polenz was first voted into the German federal Parliament, the [[Bundestag]]. Throughout his time in parliament, he served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs 

Polenz became senior member of the CDU party on 10 April 2000 under the leadership of the party's chairwoman [[Angela Merkel]]. He was the party's secretary-general from April to November 2000. 

Polenz served as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs between 2005 and 2013. He was also a member of the German delegation to the [[NATO Parliamentary Assembly]] and a substitute member of the Committee on Cultural and Media Affairs. Additionally, he chaired the Bundestag's Parliamentary Control Panel under Section 41 (5) of the Foreign Trade and Payments Act and was a substitute member of the [[Gemeinsamer Ausschuss|Joint Committee of the Bundestag and Bundesrat under Article 53 a of the Basic Law]].

==Life after politics==
Following his retirement from active politics, Polenz became president of the German Association for East European Studies (DGO).<ref>[http://dgo-online.org/personen/praesident/ Ruprecht Polenz] German Association for East European Studies (DGO).</ref> Between 2013 and 2014, he was a Senior Fellow at the Istanbul Policy Center of [[Sabancı University]].

In November 2015, Foreign Minister [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] named Polenz Special Envoy for the German-Namibian talks on a joint declaration addressing the colonial-era crackdown against [[Herero people|Herero]]s in Namibia.<ref>[http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/EN/Infoservice/Presse/Meldungen/2015/151104_Namibia.html Foreign Minister Steinmeier on relations with Namibia] [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Federal Foreign Office]], press release of 4 November 2015.</ref><ref>Theresa Krinninger (4 November 2015), [http://www.dw.com/de/polenz-ich-habe-erfahrung-mit-heikler-au%C3%9Fenpolitik/a-18828724 Polenz: "Ich habe Erfahrung mit heikler Außenpolitik"] ''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.</ref> Polenz has stated that he would consider the killings [[genocide]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/world/africa/germany-genocide-namibia-holocaust.html?ref=world |quote=“It will be described as genocide,” Ruprecht Polenz, Germany’s special envoy to the talks, said of a joint statement that the two governments are preparing. |title=Germany Grapples With Its African Genocide |first=Norimitsu |last=Onishi |date=29 December 2016 |accessdate=29 December 2016 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

==Political positions==
In 2008, Polenz and four other legislators issued a committee report which concluded that Germany's under-representation in international organizations at the time was because the country lacked a personnel policy and coherent strategy for promoting itself internationally.<ref>Judy Dempsey (11 November 2009), [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/12/world/europe/12iht-letter.html Letter from Europe: Germany Holds Back on Top European Roles] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref>

Contrary to his own party, Polenz has been one of Germany's most outspoken proponents of an [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]].<ref>[http://www.koerber-stiftung.de/edition-koerber-stiftung/programm/politikgesellschaft/artikel-detailseite/buch/better-for-both-of-them.html Ruprecht Polenz: Better for Both of Them – Turkey Ought to Be in the EU] Körber-Stiftung, Hamburg.</ref>

In 2011, Polenz was among the first to speak out publicly against the decision of Quadriga, a German nonprofit group, to honor [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] [[Vladimir Putin]] of [[Russia]]; the group later canceled its annual prize ceremony following further public criticism of Putin's stance on democracy and human rights in Russia.<ref>Nicholas Kulish (16 July 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/world/europe/17germany.html German Group That Cited Putin as ‘Role Model’ Cancels Prize After Outcry] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

Ahead of the Christian Democrats’ [[2018 Christian Democratic Union of Germany leadership election|leadership election]] in 2018, Polenz publicly endorsed [[Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer]] to succeed Angela Merkel as the party's chair.<ref>Ralf Repöhler (6 December 2018), [https://www.wn.de/Muenster/3574727-CDU-Parteitag-Benning-waehlt-AKK-ihr-Stellvertreter-Jens-Spahn Benning wählt „AKK“, ihr Stellvertreter Jens Spahn] ''Westfälische Nachrichten''.</ref>

In a well-received, open letter, Polenz turned to [[Rezo]] after his video "[[The destruction of the CDU]]". The politician largely agreed with the Youtuber's positions on climate protection and the CDU's dealings with young voters, particularly with regard to the [[School strike for the climate|Friday for future]] demonstrators.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/der-junge-leute-fluesterer-ruprecht-polenz-macht-vor-wie-politiker-soziale-medien-nutzen-sollten/24404902.html |title=Ruprecht Polenz macht vor, wie Politiker soziale Medien nutzen sollten |date=2019-10-28|lang=de}}</ref>

He has repeatedly described the [[Alternative for Germany|AfD]] as right-wing, right-wing extremist and fascist.<ref>{{cite web |author=Kirche und Leben, Münster Germany |url=https://www.kirche-und-leben.de/artikel/polenz-haelt-afd-faschismus-und-rechtsextremismus-vor/ |title=Polenz hält AfD Faschismus und Rechtsextremismus vor |date=2019-10-28|lang=de}}</ref>
