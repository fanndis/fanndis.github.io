A '''political spectrum''' is a system to characterize and classify different [[Politics|political positions]] in relation to one another. These positions sit upon one or more [[Geometry|geometric]] [[Coordinate axis|axes]] that represent independent political dimensions.<ref name=":0" /> The expressions '''political compass''' and '''political map''' are used to refer to the political spectrum as well, especially to popular two-dimensional models of it.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Petrik|first=Andreas|date=2010-12-03|title=Core Concept "Political Compass".

== Historical origin of the terms ==

The terms ''right'' and ''left'' refer to political affiliations originating early in the French Revolutionary era of 1789–1799 and referred originally to the seating arrangements in the [[Glossary of the French Revolution#Governmental structures|various legislative bodies]] of [[France]].<ref name="Knapp5ed"/> As seen from the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]]'s seat at the front of the Assembly, the [[aristocracy]] sat on the right (traditionally the seat of honor) and the [[commoner]]s sat on the left, hence the terms [[right-wing politics]] and [[left-wing politics]].<ref name="Knapp5ed"/>

Originally, the defining point on the ideological spectrum was the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' ("old order"). "The Right" thus implied support for aristocratic or royal interests and the church, while "The Left" implied support for [[republicanism]], [[secularism]] and [[civil liberties]].<ref name="Knapp5ed"/> Because the [[political franchise]] at the start of the [[revolution]] was relatively narrow, the original "Left" represented mainly the interests of the [[bourgeoisie]], the rising [[Capitalism|capitalist class]] (with notable exceptions such as the proto-communist [[François-Noël Babeuf|Gracchus Babeuf]]). Support for ''[[laissez-faire]]'' commerce and [[free market]]s were expressed by politicians sitting on the left because these represented policies favorable to capitalists rather than to the aristocracy, but outside parliamentary politics these views are often characterized as being on the Right.

The reason for this apparent contradiction lies in the fact that those [[List of anti-capitalist and communist parties with national parliamentary representation|"to the left" of the parliamentary left]], outside official parliamentary structures (such as the ''[[sans-culottes]]'' of the French Revolution), typically represent much of the working class, poor peasantry and the unemployed. Their political interests in the French Revolution lay with opposition to the aristocracy and so they found themselves allied with the early capitalists. However, this did not mean that their economic interests lay with the ''laissez-faire'' policies of those representing them politically.

As capitalist economies developed, the aristocracy became less relevant and were mostly replaced by capitalist representatives. The size of the working class increased as capitalism expanded and began to find expression partly through trade unionist, socialist, anarchist and communist politics rather than being confined to the capitalist policies expressed by the original "left". This evolution has often pulled parliamentary politicians away from laissez-faire economic policies, although this has happened to different degrees in different countries, especially those with a history of issues with more authoritarian-left countries, such as the [[Soviet Union]] or [[China]] under [[Mao Zedong]]. Thus, the word "[[American Left|Left]]" in American political parlance may refer to "liberalism" and be identified with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], whereas in a country such as France these positions would be regarded as relatively more right-wing, or centrist overall, and "left" is more likely to refer to "socialist" or "social-democratic" positioned  rather than "liberal" ones.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

== Academic investigation ==
For almost a century, social scientists have considered the problem of how best to describe political variation.

=== Leonard W. Ferguson ===
In 1950, Leonard W. Ferguson analyzed political values using ten scales measuring attitudes toward: [[birth control]], [[capital punishment]], [[censorship]], [[communism]], [[evolution]], [[law]], [[patriotism]], [[theism]], treatment of [[criminals]] and [[war]]. Submitting the results to [[factor analysis]], he was able to identify three factors, which he named [[religionism]], [[humanitarianism]] and [[nationalism]]. He defined religionism as [[belief in God]] and negative attitudes toward [[evolution]] and [[birth control]]; humanitarianism as being related to attitudes opposing war, capital punishment and harsh [[Criminal justice|treatment of criminals]]; and nationalism as describing variation in opinions on censorship, law, patriotism and communism.

This system was derived empirically, as rather than devising a political model on purely theoretical grounds and testing it, Ferguson's research was exploratory. As a result of this method, care must be taken in the interpretation of Ferguson's three factors, as factor analysis will output an abstract factor whether an objectively real factor exists or not.<ref>SAS(R) 3.11 Users Guide, [http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/stsug/62259/HTML/default/viewer.htm#ugmultfactor.htm Multivariate Analysis: Factor Analysis]</ref> Although replication of the nationalism factor was inconsistent, the finding of religionism and humanitarianism had a number of replications by Ferguson and others.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ferguson, L.W. |title=The Stability of the Primary Social Attitudes: I. Religionism and Humanitarianism |journal=Journal of Psychology |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=283–8 |year=1941 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1941.9917075 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Kirkpatrick, C. |title=Religion and humanitarianism: a study of institutional implications |journal= Psychological Monographs: General and Applied|volume=63 |issue=9 |pages=i-23 |year=1949 |doi=10.1037/h0093615 }}</ref>

=== Hans Eysenck ===
[[File:Political spectrum Eysenck.png|thumb|Diagram of the political spectrum according to Hans Eysenck]]
Shortly afterward, [[Hans Eysenck]] began researching political attitudes in [[Great Britain]]. He believed that there was something essentially similar about the National Socialists ([[Nazism|Nazis]]) on the one hand and the communists on the other, despite their opposite positions on the [[Left–right politics|left–right axis]]. As Hans Eysenck described in his 1956 book ''Sense and Nonsense in Psychology'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ditext.com/eysenck/politics.html|title=politics|access-date=5 May 2016}}</ref> Eysenck compiled a list of political statements found in newspapers and political tracts and asked subjects to rate their agreement or disagreement with each. Submitting this value questionnaire to the same process of [[factor analysis]] used by Ferguson, Eysenck drew out two factors, which he named "Radicalism" (R-factor) and "Tender-Mindedness" (T-factor).

Such analysis produces a factor whether or not it corresponds to a real-world phenomenon and so caution must be exercised in its interpretation. While Eysenck's R-factor is easily identified as the classical "left–right" dimension, the T-factor (representing a factor drawn at right angles to the R-factor) is less intuitive, as high-scorers favored [[pacifism]], [[racial equality]], [[religious education]] and restrictions on [[abortion]], while low-scorers had attitudes more friendly to [[militarism]], harsh [[punishment]], easier [[divorce]] laws and [[Triangular theory of love|companionate]] [[marriage]].

Despite the difference in [[methodology]], [[location (geography)|location]] and [[theory]], the results attained by Eysenck and Ferguson matched. Simply rotating Eysenck's two factors 45 degrees renders the same factors of religionism and humanitarianism identified by Ferguson in America.<ref name="Eysenck">{{cite book |author=Eysenck, H.J. |title=Sense and nonsense in psychology |url=https://archive.org/details/sensenonsenseinp00eyse |url-access=registration |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |year=1956 }}</ref>

Eysenck's dimensions of R and T were found by factor analyses of values in [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eysenck, H.J. |title=Primary social attitudes: A comparison of attitude patterns in England, Germany, and Sweden |journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=563–8 |year=1953 |doi=10.1037/h0054347 |pmid=13108438 }}</ref> [[France]]<ref name="Eysenck" /> and [[Japan]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Dator, J.A. |chapter=Measuring attitudes across cultures: A factor analysis of the replies of Japanese judges to Eysenck's inventory of conservative-progressive ideology |editor1-last=Schubert |editor2-first=David Joseph |editor2-last=Danelski |title=Comparative judicial behavior: cross-cultural studies of political decision-making in the East and West |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yz5BAAAAIAAJ |year=1969 |publisher=Oxford University Press |editor1-first=Glendon A.}}</ref>

One interesting result Eysenck noted in his 1956 work was that in the [[United States]] and Great Britain, most of the political variance was subsumed by the left/right axis, while in France the T-axis was larger and in the [[Middle East]] the only dimension to be found was the T-axis: "Among mid-Eastern Arabs it has been found that while the tough-minded/tender-minded dimension is still clearly expressed in the relationships observed between different attitudes, there is nothing that corresponds to the [[Political radicalism|radical]]-[[conservative]] continuum".<ref name="Eysenck" />

==== Relationship between Eysenck's political views and political research ====
Eysenck's political views related to his research: Eysenck was an outspoken opponent of what he perceived as the [[authoritarian]] abuses of the left and right and accordingly he believed that with this T axis he had found the link between [[nazism]] and [[communism]]. According to Eysenck, members of both [[ideologies]] were tough-minded. Central to Eysenck's thesis was the claim that tender-minded ideologies were [[democratic ideologies|democratic]] and friendly to [[liberty|human freedom]]s, while tough-minded ideologies were [[aggressive]] and [[authoritarian]], a claim that is open to political criticism. In this context, Eysenck carried out studies on nazism and communist groups, claiming to find members of both groups to be more "dominant" and more "aggressive" than control groups.<ref name="Eysenck" />

Eysenck left [[Nazi Germany]] to live in Britain and was not shy in attacking [[Stalinism]], noting the [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] prejudices of the Russian government, the luxurious lifestyles of the [[Soviet Union]] leadership and the [[George Orwell|Orwell]]ian "[[doublethink]]" of [[East Germany]]'s naming itself the [[German Democratic Republic]] despite being "one of the most [[dictatorship|undemocratic]] [[regime]]s in the world today".<ref>Eysenck, H.J. (1981). "Left-Wing Authoritarianism: Myth or Reality?, by Hans J. Eysenck" ''Political Psychology''</ref> While Eysenck was an opponent of Nazism, his relationship with [[Fascism|fascist]] organizations was more complex. Eysenck himself lent theoretical support to the English [[National Party (UK, 1976)|National Party]] (which also opposed "Hitlerite" Nazism) and was interviewed in the first issue of their journal ''The Beacon'' in relation to his controversial views on relative intelligence between different races.<ref>"An Interview with Prof. Hans Eysenck", ''Beacon'' February 1977</ref><ref>Stephen Rose, "Racism" ''Nature'' 14 September 1978, volume 275, page 86</ref> At one point during the interview, Eysenck was asked whether or not he was of Jewish origin before the interviewer proceeded.<ref>Billig, Micheal. (1979) "Psychology, Racism and Fascism", Chapter 6, footnote #70. Published by A.F. & R. Publications.</ref> His political allegiances were called into question by other researchers, notably [[Steven Rose]], who alleged that his scientific research was used for political purposes.<ref>Stephen Rose, "Racism Refuted", ''Nature'' 24 August 1978, volume 274, page 738</ref><ref>Stephen Rose, "Racism", ''Nature'' 14 September 1978, volume 275, page 86</ref>

==== Subsequent criticism of Eysenck's research ====
Eysenck's conception of tough-mindedness has been criticized for a number of reasons.
* Virtually no values were found to load only on the tough/tender dimension.
* The interpretation of tough-mindedness as a manifestation of "authoritarian" versus tender-minded "democratic" values was incompatible with the [[Frankfurt School]]'s [[single-axis model]], which conceptualized authoritarianism as being a fundamental manifestation of conservatism and many researchers took issue with the idea of "left-wing authoritarianism".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stone, W.F. |title=The myth of left-wing authoritarianism |journal=Political Psychology |volume=2 |issue=3/4 |pages=3–19 |year=1980 |jstor=3790998 |doi=10.2307/3790998}}</ref>
* The theory which Eysenck developed to explain individual variation in the observed dimensions, relating tough-mindedness to [[extroversion]] and [[psychoticism]], returned ambiguous research results.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Ray, J.J. |author2=Bozek, R.S. |title=Authoritarianism and Eysenck's P-scale |journal=Journal of Social Psychology |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=231–4 |year=1981 |doi=10.1080/00224545.1981.9924374 }}</ref>
* Eysenck's finding that Nazis and communists were more tough-minded than members of mainstream political movements was criticised on technical grounds by [[Milton Rokeach]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Rokeach, Milton |author2=Hanley, Charles |title=Eysenck's Tender-Mindedness Dimension: A critique |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=169–176 |date=March 1956 |doi=10.1037/h0045968 |pmid=13297921}}</ref>
* Eysenck's method of analysis involves the finding of an abstract dimension (a factor) that explains the spread of a given set of data (in this case, scores on a political survey). This abstract dimension may or may not correspond to a real material phenomenon and obvious problems arise when it is applied to human psychology. The second factor in such an analysis (such as Eysenck's T-factor) is the second best explanation for the spread of the data, which is by definition drawn at right angles to the first factor. While the first factor, which describes the bulk of the variation in a set of data, is more likely to represent something objectively real, subsequent factors become more and more abstract. Thus one would expect to find a factor that roughly corresponds to "left" and "right", as this is the dominant framing for politics in our society, but the basis of Eysenck's "tough/tender-minded" thesis (the second, T-factor) may well represent nothing beyond an abstract mathematical construct. Such a construct would be expected to appear in factor analysis whether or not it corresponded to something real, thus rendering Eysenck's thesis [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] through factor analysis.<ref>Wiggins, J.S. (1973) Personality and Prediction: Principles of Personality Assessment. Addison-Wesley</ref><ref>Lykken, D. T. (1971) Multiple factor analysis and personality research. ''Journal of Experimental Research in Personality'' 5: 161–170.</ref><ref>Ray JJ (1973) Factor analysis and attitude scales. ''The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Sociology'' 9(3):11–12.</ref>

=== Milton Rokeach ===
Dissatisfied with Hans J. Eysenck's work, Milton Rokeach developed his own two-axis model of political values in 1973, basing this on the ideas of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and [[Social equality|equality]], which he described in his book, ''The Nature of Human Values''.<ref name="Rokeach">{{cite book|first=Milton|last=Rokeach|title=The nature of human values|url=https://archive.org/details/natureofhumanval00roke|url-access=registration|year=1973|publisher=Free Press}}</ref>

Milton Rokeach claimed that the defining difference between the left and right was that the left stressed the importance of equality more than the right. Despite his criticisms of Eysenck's tough-tender axis, Rokeach also postulated a basic similarity between communism and nazism, claiming that these groups would not value freedom as greatly as more conventional [[Social democracy|social democratics]], [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] and capitalists would and he wrote that "the two value model presented here most resembles Eysenck's hypothesis".<ref name="Rokeach"/>

To test this model, Milton Rokeach and his colleagues used [[content analysis]] on works exemplifying nazism (written by [[Adolf Hitler]]), [[communism]] (written by [[Vladimir Lenin]]), capitalism (by [[Barry Goldwater]]) and [[socialism]] (written by various socialist authors). This method has been criticized for its reliance on the experimenter's familiarity with the content under analysis and its dependence on the researcher's particular political outlooks.

Multiple raters made frequency counts of sentences containing [[synonyms]] for a number of values identified by Rokeach—including freedom and equality—and Rokeach analyzed these results by comparing the relative frequency rankings of all the values for each of the four texts:
* Socialists (socialism) — freedom ranked 1st, equality ranked 2nd
* Hitler (Nazism) – freedom ranked 16th, equality ranked 17th
* Goldwater (capitalism) — freedom ranked 1st, equality ranked 16th
* Lenin (communism) — freedom ranked 17th, equality ranked 1st

=== Later research ===
In further research,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Eysenck, Hans|title=The structure of social attitudes|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=39|pages=463–6|year=1976|url=http://ammonsscientific.com/link.php?N=20755|doi=10.2466/pr0.1976.39.2.463|issue=2|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514221552/https://ammonsscientific.com/link.php?N=20755|archive-date=14 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Hans J. Eysenck refined his [[methodology]] to include more questions on [[Economics|economic issues]]. Doing this, he revealed a split in the left–right axis between [[social policy]] and [[economic policy]], with a previously undiscovered dimension of socialism-capitalism (S-factor).

While factorially distinct from Eysenck's previous R factor, the S-factor did positively [[correlate]] with the R-factor, indicating that a basic left–right or right–left tendency underlies both [[value (ethics)|social values]] and [[value system|economic values]], although S tapped more into items discussing [[economic inequality]] and [[big business]], while R relates more to the treatment of criminals and to [[Human sexuality|sexual]] issues and [[military]] issues.

Most research and [[political theory]] since this time has [[replication (scientific method)|replicated]] the factors shown above.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Another replication came from [[Ronald Inglehart]]'s research into national [[opinions]] based on the [[World Values Survey]], although Inglehart's research described the values of [[Country|countries]] rather than [[individuals]] or [[Group (sociology)|groups]] of individuals within [[nations]]. Inglehart's two-factor solution took the form of Ferguson's original religionism and humanitarianism dimensions; Inglehart labelled them "secularism–traditionalism", which covered issues of tradition and religion, like patriotism, [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]] and the importance of [[Obedience (human behavior)|obeying]] the law and [[authority figure]]s, and "survivalism – self expression", which measured issues like everyday conduct and dress, acceptance of [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] (including [[Alien (law)|foreigners]]) and [[innovation]] and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] towards people with specific controversial [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] such as [[homosexuality]] and [[vegetarianism]], as well as willingness to engage in political [[activism]].

For Greenberg and Jonas, ideological rigidity has "much in common with the related concepts of dogmatism and authoritarianism" and is characterized by "believing in strong leaders and submission, preferring one’s own in-group, ethnocentrism and nationalism, aggression against dissidents, and control with the help of police and military". Greenberg and Jonas posit that high ideological rigidity can be motivated by "particularly strong needs to reduce fear and uncertainty" and is a primary shared characteristic of "people who subscribe to any extreme government or ideology, whether it is right-wing or left-wing".

=== Inglehart: traditionalist–secular and self expressionist–survivalist ===
[[File:Inglehart Values Map.svg|thumb|A recreation of the [[Ronald Inglehart|Inglehart]]–[[Christian Welzel|Welzel]] cultural map of the world based on the [[World Values Survey]]|alt=]]
In its 4 January 2003 issue, ''[[The Economist]]'' discussed a chart,<ref name="worldvaluessurvey.org"/> proposed by [[Ronald Inglehart]] and supported by the [[World Values Survey]] (associated with the [[University of Michigan]]), to plot cultural ideology onto two dimensions. On the y-axis it covered issues of tradition and religion, like [[patriotism]], [[abortion]], [[euthanasia]] and the importance of [[Obedience (human behavior)|obeying]] the law and authority figures. At the bottom of the chart is the traditionalist position on issues like these (with loyalty to country and family and respect for life considered important), while at the top is the secular position. The x-axis deals with self-expression, issues like everyday conduct and dress, acceptance of [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] (including foreigners) and [[innovation]], and attitudes towards people with specific controversial lifestyles such as [[vegetarianism]], as well as willingness to engage in political [[activism]]. At the right of the chart is the open [[Self-expression Values|self-expressionist]] position, while at the left is its opposite position, which Inglehart calls survivalist. This chart not only has the power to map the values of individuals, but also to compare the values of people in different countries. Placed on this chart, European Union countries in continental Europe come out on the top right, Anglophone countries on the middle right, Latin American countries on the bottom right, African, Middle Eastern and South Asian countries on the bottom left and ex-Communist countries on the top left.

=== Pournelle: liberty–control, irrationalism–rationalism ===
{{main|Pournelle chart}}
This very distinct two-axis model was created by [[Jerry Pournelle]] in 1963 for his doctoral dissertation in political science. The [[Pournelle chart]] has [[liberty]] on one axis, with those on the left seeking freedom from control or protections for [[Deviance (sociology)|social deviance]] and those on the right emphasizing state authority or protections for [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] enforcement (farthest right being state worship, farthest left being the idea of a state as the "ultimate evil").  The other axis is [[rationalism]], defined here as the belief in planned social progress, with those higher up believing that there are problems with society that can be rationally solved and those lower down skeptical of such approaches.

=== Mitchell: ''Eight Ways to Run the Country'' ===
[[File:Mitchell's Eight Political Americans.png|thumb|Mitchell's Eight Political Americans|alt=]]
[[File:Mitchell's Eight Ways.png|thumb|Mitchell's Eight Ways|alt=]]In 2006, [[Brian Patrick Mitchell]] identified four main political traditions in Anglo-American history based on their regard for ''kratos'' (defined as the use of force) and ''[[archē]]'' or "archy" (defined as the recognition of rank).<ref>{{cite book |first=Brian Patrick |last=Mitchell |title=Eight ways to run the country: a new and revealing look at left and right |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hg0epWuFdRcC |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |isbn=978-0-275-99358-0}}</ref> Mitchell grounded the distinction of archy and kratos in the West's historical experience of church and state, crediting the collapse of the Christian consensus on church and state with the appearance of four main divergent traditions in Western political thought:
* [[Republicanism|Republican]] [[constitutionalism]] = pro archy, anti kratos
* [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] [[individualism]] = anti archy, anti kratos
* [[Democracy|Democratic]] [[progressivism]] = anti archy, pro kratos
* [[Plutocratic]] [[nationalism]] = pro archy, pro kratos

Mitchell charts these traditions graphically using a vertical axis as a scale of kratos/[[akrateia]] and a horizontal axis as a scale of archy/[[anarchy]]. He places democratic progressivism in the lower left, plutocratic nationalism in the lower right, republican constitutionalism in the upper right, and libertarian individualism in the upper left. The political left is therefore distinguished by its rejection of archy, while the political right is distinguished by its acceptance of archy. For Mitchell, anarchy is not the absence of government but the rejection of rank. Thus there can be both anti-government [[anarchists]] (Mitchell's "libertarian individualists") and pro-government anarchists (Mitchell's "democratic progressives", who favor the use of government force against social hierarchies such as [[patriarchy]]). Mitchell also distinguishes between [[Left anarchism|left-wing anarchists]] and [[Anarcho-capitalism|right-wing anarchists]], whom Mitchell renames "akratists" for their opposition to the government's use of force.

From the four main political traditions, Mitchell identifies eight distinct political perspectives diverging from a populist center. Four of these perspectives (Progressive, Individualist, Paleoconservative, and Neoconservative) fit squarely within the four traditions; four others (Paleolibertarian, Theoconservative, Communitarian, and Radical) fit between the traditions, being defined by their singular focus on rank or force.

=== Nolan: economic freedom, personal freedom ===
[[File:Nolan chart normal.svg|thumb|[[Nolan Chart]]]]
{{main|Nolan Chart}}
The [[Nolan Chart]] was created by libertarian [[David Nolan (Libertarian Party)|David Nolan]]. This chart shows what he considers as "[[economic freedom]]" (issues like taxation, free trade and free enterprise) on the horizontal axis and what he considers as "personal freedom" (issues like [[drug legalization]], [[abortion]] and the [[Conscription|draft]]) on the vertical axis. This puts [[Left-wing politics|left-winger]]s in the left quadrant, [[libertarianism|libertarian]]s in the top, [[centrism|centrist]]s in the middle, [[Right-wing politics|right-winger]]s in the right and what Nolan originally named [[populism|populists]] in the bottom.  Several popular online tests, where individuals can self-identify their political values, utilize the same two axes as the Nolan Chart, including [[The Political Compass]] and iSideWith.com.

[[File:Ideomap3b-sm.jpg|thumb|An economic group diagram based on [[The Political Compass]]]]
In 1998, political author [[Virginia Postrel]], in her book ''[[The Future and Its Enemies]]'', offered another single-axis spectrum that measures views of the future, contrasting stasists, who allegedly fear the future and wish to control it, and dynamists, who want the future to unfold naturally and without attempts to plan and control. The distinction corresponds to the [[utopian]] versus [[dystopian]] spectrum used in some theoretical assessments of liberalism and the book's title is borrowed from the work of the anti-[[utopian]] [[classical liberalism|classic-liberal]] theorist [[Karl Popper]]. It could also be seen as simply another name for [[conservatism]] versus [[progressivism]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Other proposed axes include:
* Focus of political concern: [[communitarianism]] vs. [[individualism]]. These labels are preferred<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Horrell|first1=David|title=Paul Among Liberals and Communitarians|journal=Pacifica|date=2005|volume=18|issue=1|pages=33–52|doi=10.1177/1030570X0501800103|hdl=10036/35872}}</ref> to the loaded language of "[[totalitarianism]]" (anti-freedom) vs. "[[libertarianism]]" (pro-freedom), because one can have a political focus on the community without being totalitarian and undemocratic. [[Council communism]] is a [[political philosophy]] that would be counted as [[communitarian]] on this axis, but is not totalitarian or undemocratic.
* Responses to conflict: according to the political philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]], those who would respond to conflict with conversation should be considered as on the left, with negotiation as in the centre, and with force as on the right. See his essay "Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies".<ref>{{cite book |last=Blattberg |first=Charles |author-link= Charles Blattberg |chapter= Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies |ssrn= 1755117 |title= Patriotic Elaborations: Essays in Practical Philosophy |publisher= McGill-Queen's University Press |year=2009 }}</ref>
* Role of the church: [[clericalism]] vs. [[anti-clericalism]]. This axis is less significant in the [[United States]] (where views of the role of [[religion]] tend to be subsumed into the general left–right axis) than in [[Europe]] (where clericalism versus anti-clericalism is much less correlated with the left–right spectrum).
* Urban vs. rural: this axis is significant today in the [[politics of Europe]], [[Politics of Australia|Australia]] and [[Politics of Canada|Canada]]. The [[Urban area|urban]] vs. [[rural]] axis was equally prominent in the [[United States]]' political past, but its importance is debatable at present. In the late 18th century and early 19th century in the United States, it would have been described as the conflict between [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamiltonian]] [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalists]] and [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian Republicans]].
* Foreign policy: [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]] (the nation should exert power abroad to implement its policy) vs. [[non-interventionism]] (the nation should keep to its own affairs). Similarly, [[multilateralism]] (coordination of policies with other countries) vs. [[isolationism]] and [[unilateralism]]
*Geopolitics: relations with individual states or groups of states may also be vital to [[party politics]]. During the [[Cold War]], parties often had to choose a position on a scale between pro-American and pro-Soviet Union, although this could at times closely match a left–right spectrum. At other times in history relations with other powerful states has been important. In early [[Canadian history]] relations with [[Great Britain]] were a central theme, although this was not "[[foreign policy]]" but a debate over the proper place of [[Canada]] within the [[British Empire]].
* International action: [[multilateralism]] (states should cooperate and compromise) versus [[unilateralism]] (states have a strong, even unconditional, right to make their own decisions).
* Political violence: [[pacifism]] (political views should not be imposed by violent force) vs. militancy (violence is a legitimate or necessary means of political expression). In [[North America]], particularly in the United States, holders of these views are often referred to as "[[War doves|doves]]" and "[[War hawk|hawks]]", respectively.
* Foreign trade: [[globalization]] (world economic markets should become integrated and interdependent) vs. [[autarky]] (the nation or polity should strive for economic independence). During the early history of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]], this was the major political continuum. At that time it was called [[free trade]] vs. [[protectionism]].
* Trade freedom vs. trade equity: free trade (businesses should be able trade across borders without regulations) vs. [[fair trade]] (international trade should be regulated on behalf of social justice).
* Diversity: [[multiculturalism]] (the nation should represent a diversity of cultural ideas) vs. [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilationism]] or [[nationalism]] (the nation should primarily represent, or forge, a majority culture).
* Participation: [[democracy]] (rule of the majority) vs. [[aristocracy]] (rule by the enlightened, elitism) vs. [[tyranny]] (total degradation of Aristocracy). Ancient Greek philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] recognized tyranny as a state in which the tyrant is ruled by utter [[Stoic passions|passion]], and not reason like the [[philosopher]], resulting in the tyrant pursuing his own desires rather than the common good.
* Freedom: [[positive liberty]] (having rights which impose an obligation on others) vs. [[negative liberty]] (having rights which prohibit interference by others).
* Social power: [[totalitarianism]] vs. [[anarchism]] (control vs. no control) Analyzes the fundamental political interaction among people, and between individuals and their environment. Often posits the existence of a moderate system as existing between the two extremes.
* Change: [[Political radicalism|radicals]] (who believe in rapid change) and [[progressivism|progressives]] (who believe in measured, incremental change) vs. [[conservatism|conservatives]] (who believe in preserving the status quo) vs. [[Reactionary|reactionaries]] (who believe in changing things to a previous state).
* Origin of state authority: [[popular sovereignty]] (the state as a creation of the people, with enumerated, delegated powers) vs. various forms of [[Autocracy|absolutism]] and [[organic state]] philosophy (the state as an original and essential authority) vs. the view held in [[anarcho-primitivism]] that "civilization originates in conquest abroad and repression at home".<ref>Diamond, Stanley, ''In Search Of The Primitive: A Critique Of Civilization'', (New Brunswick: Transaction Books, 1981), p. 1.</ref>
* Levels of sovereignty: [[Unitary state|unionism]] vs. [[federalism]] vs. [[separatism]]; or [[centralism]] vs. [[regionalism (politics)|regionalism]]. Especially important in societies where strong regional or ethnic identities are political issues.
**[[European integration]] (in Europe): [[Euroscepticism]] vs. [[European federalism]]; [[nation state]] vs. [[multinational state]].
**[[Globalization]]: [[Nationalism]] or [[Patriotism]] vs. [[Cosmopolitanism]] or [[Internationalism (politics)|Internationalism]]; [[sovereignty]] vs. [[global governance]].
* Openness: closed ([[cultural conservative|culturally conservative]] and [[protectionism|protectionist]]) vs. open ([[social liberalism|socially liberal]] and [[globalism|globalist]]). Popularised as a concept by [[Tony Blair]] in 2007 and increasingly dominant in 21st century European and North American politics.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21702750-farewell-left-versus-right-contest-matters-now-open-against-closed-new|title=The new political divide|date=30 July 2016|access-date=24 April 2017|newspaper=The Economist}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/politics-closed-party-vs-open-party/|title=The Closed Party vs. the Open Party|first=James|last=Pethokoukis|date=1 July 2016|access-date=24 April 2017|website=American Enterprise Institute}}</ref>

== Political-spectrum-based forecasts ==
As shown by Russian political scientist Stepan S. Sulakshin,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sulakshin, S. |title=A Quantitative Political Spectrum and Forecasting of Social Evolution |journal=International Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=55–66 |year=2010 |url=http://iji.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.88/prod.1091 |doi=10.18848/1833-1882/CGP/v05i04/51654 |access-date=4 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818085927/http://iji.cgpublisher.com/product/pub.88/prod.1091 |archive-date=18 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> political spectra can be used as a forecasting tool. Sulakshin offered mathematical evidence that stable development (positive dynamics of the vast number of statistic indices) depends on the width of the political spectrum: if it is too narrow or too wide, stagnation or political disasters will result. Sulakshin also showed that in the short run the political spectrum determines the statistic indices dynamic and not vice versa.

== Biological variables ==
{{main|Biology and political orientation}}
A number of studies have found that [[biology]] can be linked with political orientation.<ref name=Jost2001>{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John T.|author2=Amodio, David M.|title=Political ideology as motivated social cognition: Behavioral and neuroscientific evidence|journal=Motivation and Emotion|date=13 November 2011|volume=36|issue=1|pages=55–64|doi=10.1007/s11031-011-9260-7|url=http://www.psych.nyu.edu/jost/Jost-Amodio-2012.pdf}}</ref> This means that biology is a possible factor in political orientation but may also mean that the [[ideology]] a person identifies with changes a person's ability to perform certain tasks.
