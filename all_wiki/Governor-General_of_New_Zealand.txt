The '''governor-general of New Zealand'''{{refn|The [[New Zealand Government]] spells the title "[[governor-general]]" with a [[hyphen]],<ref name="government">{{cite web |title=Governor-General |url=https://www.govt.nz/organisations/governor-general/ |publisher=New Zealand Government |accessdate=28 October 2018 |date=31 October 2016}}</ref> unlike the [[Governor General of Canada|spelling in Canada]], for instance.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Governor General |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/crown-canada/governor-general.html |publisher=[[Government of Canada]] |accessdate=28 October 2018 |date=24 October 2018}}</ref> As ''[[governor]]'' is the [[noun]] in the title, it is [[pluralised]]; thus, "governors-general", rather than "governor-generals".<ref name="McLean2016"/> Moreover, both terms are [[Choice of case in text|capitalised]] when used in the formal title preceding an incumbent's name. |group=n}} ({{lang-mi|Te kāwana tianara o Aotearoa}})  is the  [[viceroy|viceregal]] representative of the [[Monarchy of New Zealand|monarch of New Zealand]], currently Queen [[Elizabeth II]].

The current office traces its origins to when the administration of New Zealand was placed under the [[Colony of New South Wales]] in 1839 and its governor was given jurisdiction over New Zealand. However, New Zealand would become [[Colony of New Zealand|its own colony]] the next year with its own governor. The modern "governor-general" and his or her functions came into being in 1917 and the office is currently mandated by [[Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor-General of New Zealand|Letters Patent issued in 1983]], constituting "the Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of the Realm of New Zealand".<ref name="letterspatent"/> Constitutional functions of the governor-general include presiding over the [[Executive Council of New Zealand|Executive Council]], appointing [[Ministers in the New Zealand Government|ministers]] and judges, granting [[royal assent]] to legislation, and summoning and dissolving [[New Zealand Parliament|parliament]]. These functions are generally exercised only according to the advice of an elected government. The governor-general also has an important ceremonial role: hosting events at [[Government House, Wellington|Government House]] in Wellington, and travelling throughout New Zealand to open conferences, attend services and commemorations and generally provide encouragement to individuals and groups who are contributing to their communities. When travelling abroad, the governor-general is seen as the representative of New Zealand; for this reason, the governor-general is viewed by some as the [[#De facto head of state|''de facto'' head of state]].{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=17}}<ref name="james_gg">{{cite web|first=Colin |last=James |url=http://www.colinjames.co.nz/herald/Herald_2006/Herald_column_06Aug22.htm |title=The huge challenge ahead of the Maori Queen's successor |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=22 August 2006 |author-link=Colin James (journalist) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206001054/http://www.colinjames.co.nz/herald/Herald_2006/Herald_column_06Aug22.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref name="clark_nominal_headofstate">{{cite news|work=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |title=Republic 'inevitable' – Clark |date=4 March 2002}}</ref>

The governor-general (titled "governor" before 1917) initially represented the British monarch and the [[government of the United Kingdom|British Government]]. Therefore, many past officeholders were British, including a succession of minor aristocrats from the 1890s onwards. In a gradual process, culminating with the adoption of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1947, the governor-general has become the independent, personal representative of the New Zealand monarch. In 1972, [[Denis Blundell|Sir Denis Blundell]] became the first New Zealand resident to be appointed to the office.

Governors-general are typically appointed for a five-year term of office, subject to a possible short extension, though they formally serve "[[At Her Majesty's pleasure|at the monarch's pleasure]]". The current Governor-General<!--capitalise current officeholder--> is [[Patsy Reddy|Dame Patsy Reddy]], who has served since 28 September 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/announcement-honours-dame-patsy-reddy |title=Announcement of Honours for Dame Patsy Reddy |website=beehive.govt.nz |publisher=New Zealand Government |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Announcement of a new Governor-General of New Zealand |url=https://www.royal.uk/announcement-new-governor-general-new-zealand-0?page=16 |website=royal.uk |publisher=The Royal Household |accessdate=10 December 2019 |date=21 March 2016 |quote=The Queen, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of New Zealand, has been pleased to approve the appointment of Dame Patsy Reddy as the next Governor-General of New Zealand.}}</ref> Administrative support for the governor-general is provided by the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]].

==Appointment==
The New Zealand monarch appoints the governor-general by commission issued under the [[Seal of New Zealand]],<ref name="letterspatent">{{citation |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1983/0225/latest/DLM90805.html|last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| title=Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor-General of New Zealand| date=28 October 1983| publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office|access-date=23 October 2018}}</ref><ref name="gg_role">{{cite web |url=http://www.gg.govt.nz/role/functions.htm|title=Roles of the Governor-General|publisher=Governor-General of New Zealand|location=Government House|accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref> known as the "Terms of Appointment".{{sfn|Quentin-Baxter & McLean|2017|p=124}}

Constitutional convention adopted in 1930, following the [[1930 Imperial Conference|Imperial Conference]] held that year, allowed for the appointment of the governor-general to be made upon the [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the New Zealand Government, though that right was not exercised directly by a New Zealand prime minister until 1967,{{sfn|Joseph|2014|page=140}} with the appointment of the first New Zealand-born Governor-General, [[Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt|Sir Arthur Porritt]] on the advice of [[Keith Holyoake]].{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=277}} Today, the Terms of Appointment are counter-signed by the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|New Zealand prime minister]], to signify that the prime minister is responsible for advising the sovereign on the appointment.{{sfn|Quentin-Baxter & McLean|2017|p=118}}

The prime minister's advice has sometimes been the result of a decision by Cabinet;<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.michaelbassett.co.nz/books.htm|title=Working with David: inside the Lange cabinet by Michael Bassett|year=2008|publisher=Hodder Moa|location=Auckland, New Zealand|isbn=978-1-86971-094-1|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211014524/http://www.michaelbassett.co.nz/books.htm|archivedate=11 February 2010}}</ref> there is no requirement for this, and there have been a few instances where the governor-general was appointed with no consultation of Cabinet. Since 1980, the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]] prepares a short list of candidates for the office.<ref name="Boyce">{{cite book|last1=Boyce|first1=Peter John|title=The Queen's Other Realms: The Crown and Its Legacy in Australia, Canada and New Zealand|date=2008|publisher=Federation Press |isbn=9781862877009 |pages=175–176|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kY-Tk0-quyoC|language=en}}</ref> By convention, the [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|leader of the Opposition]] is consulted on the appointment,{{sfn|Cox|2001|pages=10–11}} however this has not always been the case.{{sfn|Quentin-Baxter & McLean|2017|p=119}}

On only one occasion has the prime minister's choice of appointee aroused public anger or complaint, and that controversy was short-lived.<ref name="Boyce"/> In 1977, [[Keith Holyoake|Sir Keith Holyoake]], a former [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] Prime Minister and a serving [[Minister of State#New Zealand|Minister of State]], was controversially appointed as Governor-General.<ref name="Wood2000">{{cite web|author1=G.A.

''Rowling: The man and the myth''. Australia New Zealand Press.{{page needed|date=October 2018}}</ref> (Rowling's remark was in turn criticised by the Government, as Sir Edmund had backed the opposition Labour Party in 1975 as part of the "[[Citizens for Rowling]]" campaign.<ref name="doughty">{{cite book|first=Ross|last=Doughty|title=The Holyoake years |publisher=Feilding|year=1977}}{{page needed|date=October 2018}}</ref>) It was suggested by many commentators that it would be inappropriate to entrust the office to a former party leader or anyone who is closely allied with a political party; however, despite his background, Holyoake could not be said to have discharged his duties in a partisan way, and he stayed in office for only three years.<ref name="Wood2000"/>{{sfn|Cox|2001|pages=10–11}} Since Holyoake's appointment, the prime minister now confides with the leader of the Opposition during the nomination process, to avoid partisan controversy.{{sfn|Cox|2001|pages=10–11}}

Beginning with the appointment of [[David Beattie|Sir David Beattie]] in 1980, lawyers and judges have predominated as governors-general.<ref name="patriated">{{cite web|title=Patriated|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/history-of-the-governor-general/patriated|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=12 May 2018}}</ref> Following the [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|introduction of MMP]], it has been determined that an understanding of [[constitutional law]] is an important prerequisite for candidacy to the office.<ref name="Boyce"/>

There has been on-and-off speculation that a member of the [[House of Windsor|royal family]] might take up the position. In 2004, National MP [[Richard Worth]], an avowed [[monarchist]], asked the Prime Minister, [[Helen Clark]], whether she had considered nominating the [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Earl of Wessex]] to be the next governor-general.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=6500391|title=Sir Geoffrey popular choice for governor-general – poll|date=26 November 2004|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref>

===Election proposals===
From time to time, there have been proposals to elect the governor-general. When first drafted by then Governor [[George Grey]], the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]] contained a provision for the governor to be elected by New Zealand's Parliament. This provision was removed from the final enactment, probably because the Colonial Office wanted to keep a check on New Zealand's colonial government. In 1887, Sir George Grey, by then also a former Premier, moved the Election of Governor Bill to make the office of governor an elective position. The Bill was narrowly defeated 46–48, being opposed by the government of [[Harry Atkinson]].<ref name="identity">{{cite book|title=A Destiny Apart: New Zealand's Search for National Identity|author=Keith Sinclair|date=1986|publisher=Allen & Unwin|isbn=0868616907|ref={{sfnref|Sinclair|1986}}|author-link=Keith Sinclair}}</ref> In 1889, Grey tried again with another bill, which if passed would have allowed for a "[[British subject]]" to be elected to the office of governor "precisely as an ordinary parliamentary election in each district."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=THD18890718.2.23&e=-------10--1----0--|title=New Bills|publisher=[[The Timaru Herald]]|volume=XLIX|issue=4594|date=18 July 1889|page=3|accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref>

In 2006, political commentator [[Colin James (journalist)|Colin James]] suggested that the governor-general could be elected<ref name="james_elect">{{cite news|url=http://www.colinjames.co.nz/herald/Herald_2006/Herald_column_06Jan17.htm|title=Election: the democratic way to select our Governor-general|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=17 January 2006|last=James|first=Colin|author-link=Colin James (journalist)|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060722064926/http://www.colinjames.co.nz/herald/Herald_2006/Herald_column_06Jan17.htm|archivedate=22 July 2006}}</ref> (or, more correctly, nominated to the Queen) by a 60 percent majority of votes cast in Parliament. James argued that the New Zealand public should be given the ability to choose the Queen's representative and that the current system is undemocratic and not transparent. Such a system is not unique: the governors-general of [[Governor-General of Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Governor-General of the Solomon Islands|Solomon Islands]] are nominated in such a way. Constitutional law specialist Professor [[Noel Cox]], who is a former chair of [[Monarchy New Zealand]], criticised the proposal, claiming that "[g]iving the Governor-General a new and separate source of democratic legitimacy could result in a separation between Ministers and Governors-General. ...the Governors-General would have their own independent popular mandate, and become potential political rivals of the Ministers".<ref name="ggrole_cox">{{cite news|url=http://www.geocities.com/noelcox/Governor-general_role_needs_update.htm|last=Cox|first=Noel|author-link=Noel Cox|title=Governor-general role needs an update|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=8 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022104309/http://geocities.com/noelcox/Governor-general_role_needs_update.htm|archivedate=22 October 2009}}</ref>

In February 2008, the [[New Zealand Republic]] proposed electing the governor-general as an interim step to a republic, arguing "Electing the Governor-General allows for easier transition to a republic because the populace is used to electing someone as a ceremonial de facto head of state."<ref name="rm_gg_elect">{{cite web|url=http://www.republic.org.nz/node/211|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012174033/http://www.republic.org.nz/node/211|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-10-12|title=Republic newsletter|date=February 2008|accessdate=5 May 2008}}</ref> With the introduction of the [[Governor-General Act 2010]], Green MP [[Keith Locke]] suggested Parliament recommend the next governor-general's appointment to the Queen, with a recommendation endorsed by three-quarters of parliament.<ref name="gg_bill1">{{cite news|work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|title=New bill doubles governor-general's severance|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3938421/New-bill-doubles-governor-generals-severance|last=Vance|first=Andrea}}</ref> In its submission to the select committee considering the Bill, the Republican Movement suggested parliament appoint the next governor-general with a three-quarters majority plus a majority of party leaders in parliament, with a similar dismissal process and a fixed five-year term.<ref name="submission">{{cite news|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/politics/121423/call-75-support-parliament-new-ggs|title=Call for 75% support from Parliament for new GGs|work=[[Otago Daily Times]]|date=18 August 2010|accessdate=18 August 2010|author=NZPA|author-link=NZPA}}</ref> National MP [[Nikki Kaye]] queried whether several one-member parties in parliament could veto the decision, which could give them too much power if an appointment was based on one vote per leader. The Republican Movement responded that the method would ensure appointments were made that most MPs and parties found acceptable.<ref name="submission" />

==Tenure==
The governor-general holds office "[[at the monarch's pleasure]]", under clause II of the Letters Patent 1983.<ref name="letterspatent"/> It is the norm that an appointed individual holds office for a minimum of five years but this tenure may also be extended. The Terms of Appointment of the governor-general defines their expected term in office.{{sfn|Quentin-Baxter & McLean|2017|p=124}} For instance, [[Dame Silvia Cartwright]] would have been in office for five years on 4 April 2006, but her term as governor-general was extended by four months as Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] deemed that "the selection and appointment process [of a new governor-general] [should] not coincide with the pre-election period".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0501/S00312.htm|title=Governor General's term extended|date=31 January 2005|publisher=[[Scoop.co.nz]]|author=New Zealand Government}}</ref>

===Administrator of the Government===
A vacancy will occur on the resignation, death, incapacity or absence from New Zealand territory of the governor-general. In the absence of a governor-general the [[Chief Justice of New Zealand|chief justice]] (currently [[Helen Winkelmann]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ardern |first1=Jacinda |title=Helen Winkelmann appointed Chief Justice of New Zealand |url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/helen-winkelmann-appointed-chief-justice-new-zealand |website=beehive.govt.nz |publisher=Cabinet of New Zealand |accessdate=13 April 2020 |date=7 December 2018 |language=en-NZ}}</ref>) becomes the [[Administrator of the government#New Zealand|administrator of the Government]] and performs the functions of the office of governor-general. The administrator is required to take an oath similar to the governor-general.<ref>{{cite web|title=Administrator of the Government|url=https://gg.govt.nz/office-governor-general/conditions-appointment/administrator-government|publisher=Governor-General of New Zealand|accessdate=3 September 2017|language=en}}</ref> If there is no chief justice available then the next most senior judge of the [[New Zealand judiciary]] who is able so to act is appointed as administrator.<ref name="letterspatent"/>

Prior to the granting of [[Sewell Ministry, 1856|responsible government]] in 1856, the [[Colonial Secretary of New Zealand|colonial secretary]] acted as administrator when a governor was absent.<ref>See, for instance, [[Wikisource:The Dictionary of Australasian Biography/Shortland, Lieutenant Willoughby|Willoughby Shortland]], "sometime acting Governor of New Zealand".</ref>

==Dismissal==
The prime minister may [[Advice (constitutional)|advise]] the Queen to dismiss (recall) the governor-general.{{sfn|Quentin-Baxter & McLean|2017|p=125}} As no New Zealand governor-general has ever been dismissed on the advice of the prime minister, it is unclear how quickly the Queen would act on such advice. Some constitutional lawyers dispute whether the Queen would implement such advice at all, while others argue that the Queen would delay its implementation. Others argue that the Queen would be obliged to follow the prime minister's advice (so long as the prime minister has the confidence of the House of Representatives), and further that the Queen would be bound to implement the prime minister's advice immediately if so advised.<ref name="stockley">{{cite book|first=Andrew |last=Stockley|chapter=Becoming a republic? Issues of Law|title=Republicanism in New Zealand|editor=Luke Trainor|publisher=Dunmore Press|year=1996}}</ref>

Critics (such as supporters of a New Zealand republic) have described the ability of the prime minister to advise the Queen to recall the governor-general as a flaw in New Zealand's constitutional makeup that gives the governor-general and the prime minister the ability to dismiss one another.<ref name="rm-dismissal">{{cite web |url=http://www.republic.org.nz/documents/2007-03_Republic.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712102803/http://www.republic.org.nz/documents/2007-03_Republic.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 July 2007 |title=Republic: Newsletter of the Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand: Putting the case |accessdate=31 March 2007 }}</ref> They argue that this flaw is exacerbated by the reluctance of the monarch or their representatives to become politically involved.<ref name="rm-dismissal"/>

Three 19th-century New Zealand governors were recalled from office: [[William Hobson]] (who died before he was officially recalled),<ref name="Simpson">{{cite web|first=K.A.|last=Simpson|title=Hobson, William|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1h29/hobson-william|website=[[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]]|date=1990}}</ref> [[Robert FitzRoy]],<ref>{{cite web|first=Ian|last=Wards|title=FitzRoy, Robert|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1f12/fitzroy-robert|work=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography|accessdate=16 February 2018|date=1990}}</ref> and [[Sir George Grey]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Keith|last=Sinclair|title=Grey, George|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1g21/grey-george|work=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography|accessdate=16 February 2018|date=1990}}</ref> However, all three governed before the institution of responsible government in New Zealand; they were dismissed on the advice of the British Government.<ref name="TeAraConstitutional"/>

==Functions==
The governor-general's functions can be informally divided into three areas: constitutional, ceremonial and community.<ref name="McLean2016">{{cite encyclopedia|last1=McLean|first1=Gavin|title=Governors and governors-general|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/governors-and-governors-general|encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=29 June 2017|date=28 September 2016}}</ref>

The governor-general is a nominal chief executive, acting within the constraints of [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] and precedent. Although the governor-general's powers are in theory extensive, they are in practice very limited;{{sfn|Quentin-Baxter & McLean|2017|pp=178}} most political power is exercised by the [[New Zealand Parliament]] (which is composed of the [[Queen-in-Parliament|Governor-General-in-Parliament]] and the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]), through the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]] and [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]].<ref name="Eichbaum">{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Eichbaum|first1=Chris|title=Cabinet government – What is cabinet?|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/cabinet-government/page-1|encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=1 July 2017|date=20 June 2012}}</ref> The governor-general does use  a number of remaining powers, but almost always on the [[Advice (constitutional)|formal advice]] of the prime minister and other ministers.{{sfn|Quentin-Baxter & McLean|2017|pp=178}} Ministers are, in turn, accountable to the democratically elected House of Representatives, and through it, to the people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our system of government|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/visit-and-learn/how-parliament-works/our-system-of-government/|publisher=New Zealand Parliament|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref> (The governor-general may refuse to follow ministerial advice only in the event that the prime minister [[motion of no confidence|loses the confidence]] of the House of Representatives.<ref name="gg_role" />) Even in the appointment of a prime minister, the governor-general rarely exercises any discretion; in accordance with unwritten constitutional conventions, the governor-general must appoint the individual most likely to maintain the support of the House of Representatives: this is usually the leader of the largest party among those forming the government.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=McLean|first1=Gavin|title=Premiers and prime ministers|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/premiers-and-prime-ministers|encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=30 June 2017|date=13 December 2016}}</ref>

The governor-general appoints and dismisses Cabinet ministers and other ministers, but exercises such a function only on the prime minister's advice. Thus, in practice, the prime minister, and not the governor-general, exercises complete control over the composition of the Cabinet. The governor-general may, in theory, unilaterally dismiss a prime minister, but convention and precedent bar such an action.<ref name="modern_duties"/>

The governor-general presides over, but is not a member of, the [[Executive Council of New Zealand]].<ref name="cabinetmanual">{{cite web|title=Executive Council – Cabinet Manual|url=http://www.cabinetmanual.cabinetoffice.govt.nz/1.18|publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet|accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref> The Executive Council (which comprises all ministers) exists and meets to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet.<ref name="Eichbaum"/> The primary function of the Executive Council is to collectively and formally advise the governor-general to issue [[Orders in Council]] (to make, for example, regulations or appointments), which operate under the authority of "the Governor-General in Council".<ref name="cabinetmanual"/>

The governor-general also has custody of the [[Seal of New Zealand]] for all official instruments of "Her Majesty's Government in New Zealand".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1977/0001/latest/whole.html?search=ts_act_Seal_resel&p=1#dlm442167|title=Seal of New Zealand Act 1977}}</ref>

====Role in the New Zealand Parliament====
[[File:Governor-general-reads-speech.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Governor-General Sir Jerry Mateparae reads a speech from the throne at the opening of parliament, 2011]]
The governor-general summons and [[dissolution of parliament|dissolves]] the New Zealand Parliament, acting in the absence of the Queen.<ref name="gg_role"/> Each [[parliamentary session]] begins with the governor-general's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the [[State Opening of Parliament#Equivalents in other countries|opening of parliament]], during which the governor-general delivers the '[[Speech from the Throne]]' in the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council Chamber]], outlining the Government's legislative agenda.<ref>{{cite web |title=Roles and regalia at the Opening of Parliament |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews201410131/roles-and-regalia-at-the-opening-of-parliament |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=24 October 2018 |date=13 October 2014}}</ref> Dissolution ends a parliamentary term (which lasts a maximum of three years), and is followed by a [[Elections in New Zealand|general election]] for all seats in the House of Representatives.{{refn|The governor-general issues a [[writs of election|writ]] giving permission for an election to be held.

The governor-general may theoretically refuse a dissolution, but the circumstances under which such an action would be warranted are unclear.<ref name="TeAraConstitutional"/> It might be justified if a [[minority government]] had served only briefly and another party or coalition seemed likely to have better success in holding the confidence of the House.{{refn|See the advice of the Chief Justice, [[Sir Robert Stout]] to the Governor-General, [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Viscount Jellicoe]], in 1923, that "unless the Governor-General was satisfied that a stable Government could be formed as [an] alternative to the present Government it would be proper to grant a dissolution if requested by the Prime Minister"<ref>''Memorandum on Interview with Sir Robert Stout'', 10 July 2013: ANZ R19162235.</ref>|group=n}}

{{rquote|right|People tend to think the office of the governor-general is of little significance, which is wrong, or that it represents a substantial check on the excesses of executive government, which is also wrong.| [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Sir Geoffrey Palmer]]<ref name="bridled_power" />}}
Before a bill can become law, the [[Royal Assent]] is required. The governor-general acts on the monarch's behalf; in theory, he or she may grant the Royal Assent (making the bill law), or withhold the Royal Assent (vetoing the bill). By modern constitutional convention, however, the Royal Assent is invariably granted, and bills are never disallowed.<ref name="modern_duties">{{cite web|title=Modern duties|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/history-of-the-governor-general/modern-duties|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=1 July 2017|date=14 June 2014}}</ref> A law comes into effect from the date the governor-general signs the bill.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Royal Assent – turning bills into law |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features/the-royal-assent-turning-bills-into-law/ |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=19 August 2019 |date=5 July 2018}}</ref>

====Reserve powers====
{{Rquote|right|The Queen has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers and other important office holders, summon and dissolve Parliament, assent to Bills passed by the House of Representatives, and agree to regulations and Orders submitted by Ministers through Executive Council. The Queen delegates most of her powers to her representative, the Governor-General. While the Queen and her representative exercise these powers as a matter of law, as a matter of convention, both the Queen and the Governor-General act on the advice of the democratically elected government, in all but the most exceptional circumstances.|Former Governor-General [[Dame Silvia Cartwright]]<ref name="cartwright" />}}
The governor-general acts with the advice of the prime minister, ''unless'' the prime minister has lost the confidence of the House of Representatives.<ref name="cabinet_manual">{{cite web|url=http://cabinetmanual.cabinetoffice.govt.nz/node/68|title=On the Constitution of New Zealand: An Introduction to the Foundations of the Current Form of Government|last=Keith|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Keith|year=2008|accessdate=12 September 2011}}</ref> These are the so-called '[[Reserve power#New Zealand|reserve powers]]'. These powers include the ability to:

* Dissolve or [[wikt:prorogation|prorogue]] parliament;
* Appoint or dismiss the prime minister;
* Refuse a prime minister's request for a dissolution;
* Refuse assent to legislation.<ref name="TeAraConstitutional"/><ref>{{cite web|title=The Reserve Powers|url=https://gg.govt.nz/role/powers.htm|publisher=Governor-General of New Zealand|accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref>

The exercise of the above powers is a matter of continuing debate. Many constitutional commentators believe that the governor-general (or the sovereign) does not have the power to refuse Royal Assent to legislation — former law professor and Prime Minister [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Sir Geoffrey Palmer]] and Professor [[Matthew Palmer]] argue that any refusal of Royal Assent would cause a [[constitutional crisis]].<ref name="bridled_power">{{cite book|last1=Palmer|first1=Geoffrey|author1-link=Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|last2=Palmer|first2=Matthew|author2-link=Matthew Palmer|title=Bridled Power: New Zealand's Constitution and Government|isbn=0-19-558463-5|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|edition=Fourth}}</ref> However, some constitutional lawyers, such as Professor Philip Joseph, believe the governor-general does retain the power to refuse Royal Assent to bills in exceptional circumstances, such as the abolition of democracy.{{sfn|Joseph|2014|pages=570–571}}

As with other Commonwealth realms, the governor-general's exercise of the Royal Prerogative under the reserve powers is non-[[Justiciability|justiciable]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdu.edu.au/law/apl/Constitutional_Law/whitlam.htm#The%20role%20of%20%27conventions%27|title=The Executive and the Whitlam Dismissal|publisher=[[Northern Territory University]]|accessdate=22 May 2009}}</ref> that is, they cannot be challenged by [[judicial review]], unlike the actions of other members of the executive (such as the Prime Minister in ''[[Fitzgerald v Muldoon]]''<ref>Fitzgerald v Muldoon 2 [[NZLR]] 615 (1976)</ref>).

====Prerogative of mercy====
The governor-general also exercises the [[royal prerogative of mercy]], an ancient right of convicted persons to seek a review of their case where they allege an injustice may have occurred. The prerogative of mercy can be exercised where a person claims to have been wrongly convicted or wrongly sentenced.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Royal Prerogative of Mercy|url=https://www.gg.govt.nz/role/royalprerogative.htm|publisher=Governor-General of New Zealand|accessdate=1 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=Noel |title=The Royal Prerogative in the Realms |journal=Commonwealth Law Bulletin |date=December 2007 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=611–638 |doi=10.1080/03050710701814839 |s2cid=143050540 }}</ref>

The governor-general acts on the advice of the [[Minister of Justice (New Zealand)|minister of justice]]. The governor-general has power to grant a pardon, to refer a person's case back to the court under section 406 of the [[Crimes Act 1961]], and to reduce a person's sentence. If a person's case is referred back to the court, the court will consider the case in a similar way to hearing an appeal. The court then provides advice to the governor-general as to how to act. In 2000, [[David Bain]] was granted such an appeal to the Court of Appeal, which in turn was appealed to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]].<ref>{{cite news|title=A timeline of David Bain's case|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/309979/a-timeline-of-david-bain's-case|accessdate=1 July 2017|work=Radio New Zealand|date=2 August 2016|language=en-nz}}</ref>

===Ceremonial role===

With most constitutional functions lent to Cabinet, the governor-general is particularly invested in a representative and ceremonial role. The extent and nature of that role has depended on the expectations of the time, the individual in office at the time, the wishes of the incumbent government, and the individual's reputation in the wider community. He or she will host the Queen or her family, as well as foreign royalty and heads of state, and will represent New Zealand abroad on [[state visits]] to other nations.<ref name="international">{{cite web |title=International Role |url=https://gg.govt.nz/office-governor-general/roles-and-functions-governor-general/international-role |website=gg.govt.nz |publisher=Governor-General of New Zealand |accessdate=5 November 2020 |language=en-NZ}}</ref>{{refn|Before a [[Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor-General of New Zealand#2006|2006 reform]] of the letters patent, the governor-general had to ask the monarch's permission, via the prime minister, before leaving New Zealand.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Unity Elias|title=Last Great Queen?: Elizabeth II, Mother of leadership, Seen from the crowd|page=189|date=2014|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781491895160}}</ref>|group=n}} At least once during their term, the governor-general visits the other nations within the Realm of New Zealand: [[Niue]], the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Tokelau]], and the [[Ross Dependency]].<ref name="international"/> Also as part of international relations, the governor-general issues the credentials (called [[letter of credence]]) of [[List of Ambassadors of New Zealand|New Zealand ambassadors]] and consuls,{{sfn|Quentin-Baxter & McLean|2017|pp=282–285}} as authorised by the Letters Patent.<ref name="letterspatent"/>

Increasingly, the governor-general is personally accorded the same respect and privileges of a head of state. This is particularity true when the governor-general visits other nations or receives heads of states.{{sfn|McLean|2006|pp=16–17}}

Under the [[Defence Act 1990]] and letters patent the governor-general is also the formal [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[New Zealand Defence Force|Defence Force]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.govt.nz/display/document.asp?navid=82&docid=2777&pageno=4|title=Review of Defence Force Standards of Behaviour|publisher=[[State Services Commission]]|date=16 July 2002|accessdate=13 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216171817/http://www.ssc.govt.nz/display/document.asp?navid=82&docid=2777&pageno=4|archive-date=16 December 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The position technically involves issuing commands for New Zealand troops, though the governor-general normally acts on the advice of responsible ministers. In practice, the commander-in-chief is a ceremonial role in which the governor-general will visit [[List of New Zealand military bases|military bases in New Zealand and abroad]] to take part in military ceremonies, see troops off to and return from active duty, and encourage excellence and morale amongst the forces.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Governor-General's role as Commander-in-Chief|url=https://gg.govt.nz/node/961|publisher=Governor-General of New Zealand|accessdate=24 October 2016|date=10 December 2008}}</ref>

===Community role===
The governor-general provides leadership in the community.

Many of the governor-general's community functions have a ceremonial dimension, such as attendance at the official openings of buildings, addresses to open conferences, or launching special events and appeals. The governor-general spends a large share of his or her working time attending [[state banquet]]s and receptions, making and hosting state visits, meeting ceremonial groups, and [[New Zealand royal honours system|awarding medals and decorations]].<ref name="Honours">{{cite web|title=Overview of The New Zealand Royal Honours System|url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours/overview/history|work=www.dpmc.govt.nz/honours|publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet|accessdate=27 March 2013}}</ref> As well as attending public events, the governor-general hosts many community functions at [[Government House, Wellington]], such as a garden reception to mark [[Waitangi Day]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Waitangi Day Garden Reception Ballot information |url=https://gg.govt.nz/office-governor-general/invitations-patronage-and-cards/waitangi-day-garden-party-information |publisher=Governor-General of New Zealand |accessdate=5 November 2020 |language=en-NZ}}</ref> According to the official website of the governor-general, in a typical year over 15,000 people will attend such events.<ref name="community_role"/>

The flag in its present form was adopted in 2008 and is a blue field with the shield of the [[New Zealand coat of arms]] surmounted by a crown in the centre.<ref name="Beehive.govt.nz">{{cite press release |title=New flag for Governor-General |url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-flag-governor-general |website=Beehive.govt.nz |publisher=New Zealand Government |accessdate=24 October 2018 |date=3 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Governor-General's flag|url=https://gg.govt.nz/content/governor-generals-flag|publisher=Governor-General of New Zealand|accessdate=30 June 2017}}</ref> It takes precedence over the [[Flag of New Zealand|national flag]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Other flags |url=https://mch.govt.nz/nz-identity-heritage/flags/other-flags |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=24 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref> When the governor-general undertakes a state visit abroad, however, the national flag is generally employed to mark his or her presence.

=== Precedence and titles===
In the [[New Zealand order of precedence]], the governor-general outranks all individuals except the sovereign.<ref>{{cite web|title=2015 Order of Precedence in New Zealand|url=https://www.gg.govt.nz/sites/all/files/u15/2015%20Order%20of%20Precedence%20for%20New%20Zealand.pdf|publisher=Governor-general of New Zealand|accessdate=30 June 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304142748/http://gg.govt.nz/sites/all/files/u15/2015%20Order%20of%20Precedence%20for%20New%20Zealand.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref> The governor-general and [[Spouse of the Governor-General of New Zealand|their spouse]] are [[style (manner of address)|styled]] "His/Her [[Excellency]]" during the term in office, and the governor-general is entitled to the style "[[Right Honourable#New Zealand|The Right Honourable]]" for life upon assuming the office.<ref name="beehive_hon">{{cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/ViewDocument.aspx?DocumentID=26475|title=Changes to rules around use of title|last=Clark|first=Helen|author-link=Helen Clark|publisher=The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of New Zealand|date=17 July 2006|accessdate=21 August 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025848/http://www.beehive.govt.nz/ViewDocument.aspx?DocumentID=26475|archivedate=27 September 2007}}</ref> From 2006, former living governors-general were entitled to use the style "the Honourable", if they did not already hold the title or the higher appointment of Privy Counsellor.<ref name="cartwright">{{cite web|last=Cartwright|first=Silvia|author-link=Silvia Cartwright|url=http://www.gg.govt.nz/node/577|title=Modern aspects of the role of the Governor‑General of New Zealand|accessdate=13 August 2007|date=23 June 2006|publisher=Governor-general of New Zealand}}</ref>

The incumbent governor-general uses the titles of Chancellor and Principal Knight or Dame Grand Companion of the [[New Zealand Order of Merit]]<ref>[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1996/0205/latest/DLM216686.html#DLM2177404 Statutes of the New Zealand Order of Merit] 1996, reg 5</ref> and Principal Companion of the [[Queen's Service Order]].<ref>[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1975/0200/latest/whole.html#DLM47535 Statutes of the Queen's Service Order] 1975, reg 4</ref> He or she is titled "[[Sir]]" or "[[Dame]]".

=== Official dress ===
[[Image:Lord Islington.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[John Dickson-Poynder, 1st Baron Islington|Lord Islington]] in the traditional ceremonial uniform]]
The governor-general is entitled to a special [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom#Foreign Service variants|court uniform]] that is worn on ceremonial occasions, consisting of a dark navy wool double-breasted coatee with silver oak leaf and fern embroidery on the collar and cuffs trimmed with silver buttons embossed with the [[Royal Arms]]; bullion-edged [[epaulette]]s on the shoulders; dark navy trousers with a wide band of silver oak-leaf braid down the outside seam; silver sword belt with ceremonial sword; [[bicorne]] cocked hat with [[Plume (feather)|plume]] of ostrich feathers; black patent leather Wellington boots with spurs, etc.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trendell |first1=Hebert A.

This dress has fallen into disuse since the 1980s. Initially this was due to [[Sir Paul Reeves]], as a cleric, choosing not wearing a military uniform. Although not specifically colonial, the traditional dress was abandoned as overt reminders of a colonial legacy.{{sfn|Cox|2001|page=20}} Usually the governor-general will now wear a black lounge jacket with morning dress trousers for men or formal day dress for ladies (or military uniform if they are already entitled to it) for ceremonial occasions and normal day dress at other times. The undress form of the uniform is still worn on rare occasions, such as when the governor-general visits military bases.{{sfn|Cox|2001|page=20}}

==History==

===Governors===
[[File:Appointment of William Hobson as Lieutenant Governor, 1839.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Document appointing William Hobson as lieutenant governor of New Zealand in 1839]]
[[File:WilliamHobsonGovNZ.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|William Hobson, first Governor of New Zealand]]
From 1832 [[James Busby]] was assigned the post of official [[British resident]] in New Zealand.<ref name="Orange1">{{citation |last1=Orange |first1=Claudia |title=Busby James |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1b54/busby-james |work=[[Dictionary of New Zealand Biography]] |accessdate=25 October 2018 |date=1990}}</ref> He played a role in drafting the [[Treaty of Waitangi]],<ref name="Orange1"/> which established British colonial rule over New Zealand. Captain [[William Hobson]] was first appointed [[Lieutenant-Governor]] of New Zealand by letters patent on 24 November 1840 (having previously been the British Consul to New Zealand), when New Zealand was part of the colony of [[New South Wales]]. While Hobson is usually considered the first Governor of New Zealand, [[George Gipps|Sir George Gipps]] was the first governor ''over'' New Zealand, albeit only in his capacity as [[Governor of New South Wales]], until New Zealand was established as a separate colony on 3 May 1841. Hobson continued in office until his death on 10 September 1842.<ref name="Simpson"/> In Hobson's place the [[Colonial Office]] appointed Captain [[Robert FitzRoy]]. FitzRoy struggled to keep order between [[Māori people|Māori]] and [[Pākehā settlers|settlers]] keen to buy their land, with very limited financial and military resources at his disposal. Outbreak of the first armed conflicts of the [[New Zealand Wars]] and FitzRoy's siding with Māori claims against the [[New Zealand Company]] and its settlers over land deals lead to his recall by the Colonial Office in 1845.<ref>{{citation |last1=Wards |first1=Ian |title=FitzRoy, Robert |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1f12/fitzroy-robert |work=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography |accessdate=22 October 2018 |date=1990}}</ref>

[[File:GeorgeEdwardGrey02.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Sir George Grey, twice Governor of New Zealand and later Premier]]
[[File:Hercules_Robinson_Proclamation.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead]] Proclamation as Governor (1879)]]
FitzRoy's replacement, [[Sir George Grey]], is considered by some historians, such as [[Michael King]],<ref name="King">{{cite book|last=King|first=Michael|publisher=Penguin|title=The Penguin History of New Zealand|author-link=Michael King|year=2003}}</ref> to be the most important and influential Governor of New Zealand. Grey was the last Governor of New Zealand to act without reference to parliament. During his first term (1845–1852), Grey petitioned the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] to largely suspend the complex [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1846]] (Grey briefly took the title "Governor-in-Chief" under the Act but this was eventually reverted to Governor), drafting his own constitution bill, which became the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]]. Grey's first term ended before [[responsible government]] was implemented, although he established the first [[Provinces of New Zealand|provinces]] under the 1846 Constitution Act, appointing a [[Lieutenant-Governor]] for each of the provinces: [[George Dean Pitt]] for the [[New Ulster Province]] and [[Robert Wynyard]] for the [[New Munster Province]].{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=44}} The office of Lieutenant-Governor was superseded by elected Superintendents with the implementation of the 1852 Constitution Act, in 1853.{{sfn|Brett|2016|p=61}}

The task of overseeing the transition to a responsible government was left to Robert Wynyard, as the [[Administrator of the Government]], who opened the [[1st New Zealand Parliament]] on 24 May 1854.{{sfn|McLean|2006|page=50}} Wynyard was quickly confronted by the demands from members of parliament for the ability to select ministers from among their number—rather than the governor deciding. The parliament passed a resolution to that effect on 2 June. Wynyard and the [[Executive Council of New Zealand]] refused to allow this, stating that the Colonial Office made no mention of responsible government in its dispatches. Wynyard then offered to add some elected members of parliament to the Executive Council, which he did—a compromise that worked for a few weeks, until on 1 August 1854, parliament again demanded complete power to appoint ministers. Wynyard refused and prorogued parliament for two weeks. Then on 31 August, he appointed more elected members to the Executive Council, but when Parliament met again on 8 August 1855, it moved a motion of no confidence in the members. Fortunately for Wynyard the next Governor, [[Thomas Gore Browne|Sir Thomas Gore Browne]], arrived on 6 September 1855. Gore Browne's tenure saw the introduction of responsible government, which constrained the powers of the governor,{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=49}} who now had to work with a [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Premier]] and their ministers. In the following years, Gore Browne and Premier [[Edward Stafford (politician)|Edward Stafford]] clashed over whether the governor (and hence the imperial government) had control over Māori affairs, a key issue at the time with the ongoing New Zealand Wars. Stafford began the practice of [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] meeting independently of the Executive Council, further reducing the influence of the governor. Sir George Grey returned to New Zealand in 1861 for a second term. Grey struggled to meet the competing demands of the Colonial and British governments. The New Zealand Wars had brought many thousands of British troops to New Zealand, and fearing further fighting Grey, with the support of Edward Stafford, evaded Colonial Office instructions to finalise their return to Britain. In the end, the Colonial Office recalled Grey in February 1868.<ref name="dnzb">{{cite web|last=Sinclair|first=Keith|author-link=Keith Sinclair|title=Dictionary of New Zealand Biography George Grey 1812 – 1898|date=7 April 2006|url=http://www.dnzb.govt.nz/dnzb/default.asp?Find_Quick.asp?PersonEssay=1G21|accessdate=3 July 2007}}</ref>

After Grey, successive governors of New Zealand were derived from the British aristocracy and played a much less active role in government.{{sfn|McLean|2006|page=115}} In only a few instances did the governor refuse the advice of the premier. Ironically this happened mainly during the tenure of Sir George Grey as Premier of New Zealand from 1877 to 1879.{{sfn|McLean|2006}} One famous instance of the use of the governor's powers came during the term of [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Sir Arthur Gordon]]. Sir Arthur had left New Zealand on 13 September 1881 for a visit to the Pacific Islands. In his absence, Premier [[John Hall (New Zealand)|John Hall]] advised [[Chief Justice of New Zealand|Chief Justice]] [[James Prendergast (judge)|James Prendergast]], acting as the Administrator of the Government (Prendergast was well known for his negative opinions about Māori from his decision in the case ''[[Wi Parata v the Bishop of Wellington]]''), to order the invasion of the Māori pacifist [[Te Whiti o Rongomai]]'s village at [[Parihaka]], something the Governor had indicated he was opposed to.{{sfn|McLean|2006|pages=102–104}}

===Governors-General===
====British subjects====
In 1907 [[Joseph Ward|Sir Joseph Ward]]'s [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal government]] passed a resolution to create New Zealand as the [[Dominion of New Zealand]]. This led to new letters patent being issued in 1917, which greatly curtailed the powers of the governor.{{sfn|Joseph|2014|pages=155–157}} To reflect these changes, the office was renamed governor-general (equivalent to governors-general of other [[dominion]]s), with the [[Arthur Foljambe, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Earl of Liverpool]], the serving Governor, becoming the first to be titled Governor-General.<ref>{{cite web |title=Second Earl of Liverpool |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/second-earl-of-liverpool |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=22 October 2018}}</ref>

In 1926, following the [[King-Byng affair]] in Canada, an Imperial Conference approved the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]], which defined a British Commonwealth as a freely associated grouping known as the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name="TeAraConstitutional"/> The Declaration was ratified by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British (Imperial) Parliament]] with the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931. The effect of the Declaration was to elevate the governor-general from a representative of the British Government to a regal position with all the theoretical constitutional powers of the sovereign. New Zealand did not ratify the Statute of Westminster until after the [[Second World War]] however, with the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947]] being passed on 25 November 1947.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=McIntyre |first1=W. David |title=Self-government and independence – Towards a republic? |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/self-government-and-independence/page-7 |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=22 October 2018 |date=20 June 2012}}</ref>

Despite adopting the statute later than most other Commonwealth realms, the functions of the governor-general in representing the British Government were gradually reduced prior to the statute passing. For example, beginning in 1939, the [[British High Commissioner to New Zealand]] replaced the Governor-General as the foremost diplomatic representative of the British Government in New Zealand.<ref name="TeAraConstitutional"/>

In 1945, New Zealand Prime Minister [[Peter Fraser]] suggested that [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|Sir Bernard Freyberg]], the British-born commander of New Zealand's armed forces, be appointed Governor-General.{{sfn|Joseph|2014|page=140}} Until 1967, the precedent was that governors-general were nominated by the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] (successor of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Office]]) in consultation with the New Zealand prime minister, who then recommended appointments to the sovereign.{{sfn|Joseph|2014|pages=140–141}}

====New Zealand citizens====
[[File:Catherine Tizard 1992.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Catherine Tizard|Dame Catherine Tizard]], the first female governor-general, appointed in 1990]] 
During the 1960s, the Foreign Office made strong overtures that the appointment of the governor-general should be made by the New Zealand prime minister and the Queen.{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=256}} A [[Gallup poll]] for the ''[[Auckland Star]]'' newspaper found 43 percent of respondents preferred Britons for the role, while 41 percent favoured New Zealanders and 6 percent candidates from other Commonwealth countries.{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=277}}
In 1967 the first New Zealand-born Governor-General, [[Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt|Sir Arthur Porritt]] (later Lord Porritt), was appointed to the office, on the advice of the New Zealand Prime Minister, [[Keith Holyoake|Sir Keith Holyoake]].<ref name="patriated"/> Porritt's appointment was followed by [[Denis Blundell|Sir Denis Blundell]] in 1972, who was the first fully New Zealand-resident Governor-General.<ref name="changing characteristics">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/governors-and-governors-general/page-2 |last1=McLean |first1=Gavin |title=Governors and governors-general – Changing characteristics |encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=22 October 2018 |date=20 June 2012}}</ref>

In 1983, letters patent were issued once again, further reducing the powers of the office.{{sfn|Joseph|2014|page=154}} The new letters patent were counter-signed by the New Zealand Prime Minister, symbolising the "[[wikt:patriation|patriation]]" of the office.<ref name="patriated"/>  The governor-general now presided over the "Realm of New Zealand" instead of the "Dominion of New Zealand".{{sfn|Joseph|2014|page=154}}

Following the [[1984 New Zealand constitutional crisis|1984 constitutional crisis]], the 1852 Constitution Act was replaced by the [[Constitution Act 1986]] and the governor-general's powers further limited. For example, section 16 of the 1986 Act significantly narrowed section 56 of the 1852 Act so that the governor-general has much less discretion to refuse Royal Assent to bills of parliament.<ref name="const_act">{{Cite journal| date=1 January 1987| title=Constitution Act 1986| publisher=New Zealand Parliamentary Counsel Office|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1986/0114/latest/whole.html#DLM94210| accessdate=22 October 2018}}</ref>{{sfn|Joseph|2014|page=162}}

With the patriation of the office came an expectation that the officeholders would be representative of New Zealanders generally;<ref name="changing characteristics" /> since then a more diverse group of governors-general have been appointed. Former Anglican [[Archbishop of New Zealand]] [[Sir Paul Reeves]] (1985–90) was the first Māori Governor-General.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sir Paul Reeves |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/sir-paul-reeves |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref> [[Dame Catherine Tizard]] (1990–96) was the first woman to be appointed to the office.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Hon Dame Catherine Tizard, GCMG, GCVO, DBE, QSO |url=https://gg.govt.nz/biographies/hon-dame-catherine-tizard-gcmg-gcvo-dbe-qso |publisher=Governor-General of New Zealand |accessdate=23 October 2018}}</ref> [[Sir Anand Satyanand]] (2006–11) was the first Governor-General of [[Indian New Zealanders|Indian]] and [[Pacific Islander]] origin,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Leckie |first1=Jacqueline |title=Anand Satyanand: A prominent son of the Indian diaspora |journal=[[New Zealand Journal of Asian Studies]] |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=31–46 |url=http://www.nzasia.org.nz/journal/jas_dec2014_leckie.pdf |accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref> and the first Roman Catholic to hold the office.<ref>{{cite speech |last1=Satyanand |first1=Anand |title=Speech to Australasian Network of Pastoral Planners |url=https://gg.govt.nz/publications/australasian-network-pastoral-planners |publisher=Government House |accessdate=26 October 2018 |location=Wellington |date=18 February 2009 |quote=Much was made of the fact that I was New Zealand's first Governor-General of Asian descent.

===''De facto'' head of state===

We have, to all intents and purposes the nominal Head of State in our Governor-General| [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Helen Clark]]|March 2002<ref name="clark_nominal_headofstate" />}}
Increasingly, the governor-general is regarded as a ''de facto'' [[head of state]]. Political commentator [[Colin James (journalist)|Colin James]] has expressed this view,<ref name="james_gg" /> along with historian Gavin McLean{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=17}} and former Prime Minister Helen Clark.<ref name="clark_nominal_headofstate" />

The governor-general has been performing more and more of the functions of a head of state, such as travelling overseas, representing all New Zealanders at major international events and generally promoting New Zealand interests abroad. The first time such a visit occurred was in 1989 for the [[Death and funeral of Hirohito|state funeral of the late Japanese Emperor]] [[Hirohito]].{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=315}} However, governors-general could not make state visits until 1992, when the King of Spain invited [[Dame Catherine Tizard]] on a State Visit for the [[Seville Expo '92]].{{sfn|Tizard|2010|p=263}} Buckingham Palace advised that the Queen cannot travel abroad in her capacity as Queen of New Zealand.{{sfn|Tizard|2010|p=263}} As a compromise, the Palace agreed that governors-general could accept invitations for state visits,{{sfn|Tizard|2010|p=264}} but that it must be made clear that the governor-general is the Sovereign's representative.{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=315}} At the 2007 commemorations of the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], Governor-General Anand Satyanand represented New Zealand<ref name="gg_represent">{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0707/S00104.htm|title=Governor-General visits Belgium for Passchendaele Commemoration|date=6 July 2007|publisher=Government House}}</ref> on behalf of the Queen, while the Queen herself represented the United Kingdom.<ref name="queen_rep">{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/12/europe/EU-GEN-Belgium-WWI-Passchendaele.php?page=1 |title=Queen Elizabeth II, Belgian royals pay tribute to allied soldiers of Passchendaele battle |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=11 July 2007 |agency=Associated Press |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220074207/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/12/europe/EU-GEN-Belgium-WWI-Passchendaele.php?page=1 |archivedate=20 February 2008}}</ref>

Reform of the office is usually only mentioned in the context of a [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand republic]]. Helen Clark, when defending [[Dame Silvia Cartwright]] following a political controversy over prison sentences, stated "[o]ne of the challenges for us is we clearly are no longer a dominion of Britain where the Governor-General is exactly like the Queen. I think we need to consider how the role of Governor-General might evolve further. As you know, my view is that one day there will be a president fulfilling the kind of role the Governor-General does."<ref name="clark_herald">{{cite news|title=Clark foresees president role|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=2349518|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=NZPA|date=15 August 2002|accessdate=23 July 2007|author-link = NZPA}}</ref> Others, such as Professor [[Noel Cox]] have argued that the governor-general's role needs to be updated, rather than reforming the office.<ref name="ggrole_cox" />

Some constitutional academics expressed concern that the process of [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|electoral reform]] could result in the governor-general having greater political influence due to the reserve powers of government formation.<ref name="stockley" /> In 1993, the then Governor-General Dame Catherine Tizard caused controversy by suggesting that under the proposed [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) electoral system, the governor-general may have to use their reserve powers more often.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1236&context=blr |last1=Cox|first1=Noel|title=The Effect of the Advent of the Mixed-Member Proportional Voting System Upon the Role of the Governor-General of New Zealand|publisher=University of Auckland|page=434|date=2002 |accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref> Following the adoption of MMP at a referendum later in 1993, Prime Minister [[Jim Bolger]] suggested at the opening of parliament in 1994 that one reason New Zealand might move to a republic was that the governor-general would have more influence under the new electoral system.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bolger|first=Jim|author-link=Jim Bolger|title=Address-In-Reply debate, state opening of Parliament|date=March 1994}}</ref> In a 1996 address, Governor-General [[Sir Michael Hardie Boys]] clarified how he would use his powers in the case of an unclear electoral result; he maintained that politicians must decide who would govern, and only after a public announcement of their decision would he appoint a prime minister.<ref name="Hardie Boys">{{Cite speech |first=Michael |last=Hardie Boys |title=The Role of the Governor-General under MMP |date=24 May 1996 |event=Address to the Annual Dinner of the Institute of International Affairs |location=Wellington}}</ref>

In December 2009 a review of the Civil List Act 1979 by the Law Commission recommended that part 1 of the Act be repealed, and replaced with a new Governor-General Bill to reflect the nature of the modern office of governor-general. The most significant change would be that the governor-general was no longer exempt from paying income tax on their salary. The changes proposed in the report would take effect for the appointment and term of the next Governor-General.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0912/S00239.htm|title=Review of the Civil List Act 1979: Law Comm Report|date=17 December 2009|publisher=[[New Zealand Law Commission]]|accessdate=18 December 2009}}</ref> The Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 28 June 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/7B3B73E3-47FC-456C-83D3-8BA19D6A5BAC/147239/00HOH20100630_orderpaper3.pdf|title=Parliament of New Zealand – Order Paper|date=30 June 2010|publisher=[[Parliamentary Counsel Office (New Zealand)]]|archive-date=30 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330081055/http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/7B3B73E3-47FC-456C-83D3-8BA19D6A5BAC/147239/00HOH20100630_orderpaper3.pdf}}</ref> and was granted Royal Assent on 22 November 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2010/0122/latest/DLM2999104.html|title=Governor-General Act 2010|website=legislation.govt.nz |publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office|date=22 November 2010}}</ref>
