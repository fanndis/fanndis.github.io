{{Politics of New Zealand}}

In [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand politics]], '''Māori electorates''', colloquially known as the '''Māori seats''', are a special category of [[New Zealand electorates|electorate]] that until 1967 gave [[Reserved political positions|reserved positions]] to representatives of [[Māori people|Māori]] in the [[New Zealand Parliament]]. Every area in New Zealand is covered by both a general and a Māori electorate; as of 2020, there are seven Māori electorates.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/maori-and-the-vote/twentieth-century |publisher=New Zealand History |website=Māori and the vote |page=3 |title=Change in the 20th century}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/population/census_counts/NumberofElectoratesandElectoralPopulations_HOTP2013Census/Commentary.aspx |title=Number of Electorates and Electoral Populations: 2013 Census |date=7 October 2013 |website=Stats NZ |access-date=13 December 2019}}</ref> Since 1967 any candidate of any ethnicity has been able to stand in a Maori electorate. Candidates now do not have to be Māori, or even on the Māori roll. Voters however who wish to vote in a Māori electorate have to register as a voter on the Māori roll and need to declare they are of Māori descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elections.org.nz/events/maori-electoral-option-2018/about-maori-electoral-option|publisher=Electoral Commission New Zealand|title=About the Māori Electoral Option|date=17 September 2018|accessdate=23 May 2019}}</ref>

The Māori electorates were introduced in 1867 under the Maori Representation Act.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maori Representation Act 1867 |url=http://www.enzs.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=810&action=null|accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> They were created in order to give Māori a more direct say in parliament. The [[first Māori elections]] were held in the following year during the term of the [[4th New Zealand Parliament]]. The electorates were intended as a temporary measure lasting five years but were extended in 1872 and made permanent in 1876.<ref>{{cite web|website=archives.govt.nz |title=Representation Act 1867|url=http://archives.govt.nz/provenance-of-power/maori-representation-act-1867}}</ref> Despite numerous attempts to dismantle Māori electorates, they continue to form a distinct part of the New Zealand political landscape.<ref name="Origins of the Māori Seats">{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=John |title=The Origins of the Māori Seats |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/research-papers/document/00PLLawRP03141/origins-of-the-m%C4%81ori-seats |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=4 December 2016 |location=Wellington |origyear=November 2003|date=31 May 2009}}</ref>

== Organisation ==
Māori electorates operate much as do general electorates, but have as electors people who are [[Māori people|Māori]] or of Māori descent, <!-- definition taken from Māori Electoral Option 2006 brochure-->and who choose to place their names on a separate electoral roll rather than on the "general roll".

There are two features of the Māori electorates that make them distinct from the general electorates. First, there are a number of skills that are essential for candidates to have in order to engage with their constituencies and ensure a clear line of accountability to representing the 'Māori voice'. This includes proficiency in the [[Māori language]], knowledge of [[tikanga Māori]], [http://maoridictionary.co.nz/word/10068 whakawhanaungatanga] skills and confidence on the [[marae]]. Second, the geographical size of the Māori electoral boundaries vary significantly from the general electorates. Five to 18 general electorates fit into any one Māori electorate.{{sfn|Bargh|2015|pp=302–303}}

Māori electoral boundaries are superimposed over the electoral boundaries used for general electorates; thus every part of New Zealand simultaneously belongs both in a general seat and in a Māori seat. Shortly after each census all registered Māori electors have the opportunity to choose whether they are included on the Māori or General electorate rolls.<ref name="Māori Electoral Option 2013">{{Cite web |title=Māori Electoral Option 2013 &#124; Electoral Commission |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/events/past-events/maori-electoral-option-2013 |accessdate=9 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328045809/http://www.elections.org.nz/events/past-events/maori-electoral-option-2013 |archive-date=28 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Each five-yearly Māori Electoral Option determines the number of Māori electorates for the next one or two elections.

==Establishment==

The establishment of Māori electorates came about in 1867 during the term of the [[4th New Zealand Parliament|4th Parliament]] with the Maori Representation Act, drafted by [[Napier (New Zealand electorate)|Napier]] member of parliament [[Donald McLean (New Zealand politician)|Donald McLean]].<ref name="Origins of the Māori Seats" /> Parliament passed the Act only after lengthy debate, it was passed during a period of warfare between the Government and several North Island Māori tribes, and was seen as a way to reduce conflict between the races in future.<ref>{{cite web |website=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |title=Maori Representation Act 1867 |url= https://teara.govt.nz/en/zoomify/33905/maori-representation-act-1867}}</ref> The act originally agreed to set up four electorates specially for Māori three in the North Island and one covering the whole South Island.<ref name=Seats>{{cite web |publisher=New Zealand History |title=Setting up the Māori seats |website=Maori and the Vote |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/maori-and-the-vote/setting-up-seats |page=2}}</ref> The four seats were a fairly modest concession on per capita basis at the time.<ref name=Seats />

Many conservative MPs, most of whom considered Māori "unfit" to participate in government, opposed Māori representation in Parliament, while some MPs from the other end of the spectrum (such as [[James FitzGerald (New Zealand politician)|James FitzGerald]], who had proposed allocating a third of Parliament to Māori) regarded the concessions given to Māori as insufficient. In the end the setting up of Māori electorates separate from existing electorates assuaged conservative opposition to the bill – conservatives had previously feared that Māori would gain the right to vote in general electorates, thereby forcing all MPs (rather than just four Māori MPs) to take notice of Māori opinion.

Before this law came into effect, no direct prohibition on Māori voting existed, but other indirect prohibitions made it extremely difficult for Māori to exercise their theoretical electoral rights. The most significant problem involved the property qualification – to vote, one needed to possess a certain value of land.{{sfn|Bargh|2015|pp=302–303}} Māori owned a great deal of land, but they held it in common, not under individual title, and under the law, only land held under individual title could count towards the property qualification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/features-pre-2016/document/00NZPHomeNews201109011/the-origins-of-the-m%C4%81ori-seats|title=The origins of the Māori seats|website=New Zealand Parliament – Pāremata Aotearoa}}</ref> Donald McLean explicitly intended his bill as a temporary measure, giving specific representation to Māori until they adopted European customs of land ownership. However, the Māori electorates lasted far longer than the intended five years, and remain in place today, despite the property qualification for voting being removed in 1879.

The first four Māori members of parliament elected in [[First Māori elections|1868]] were [[Tareha te Moananui|Tāreha te Moananui]] ([[Eastern Maori]]), [[Frederick Nene Russell]] ([[Northern Maori]]) and [[John Patterson (Southern Maori politician)|John Patterson]] ([[Southern Maori]]), who all retired in 1870; and [[Mete Paetahi|Mete Kīngi Te Rangi Paetahi]] ([[Western Maori]]) who was defeated in 1871. These four persons were the first New Zealand-born members of the New Zealand Parliament.<ref>{{cite book | ref = harv | editor-last = Scholefield | editor-first = Guy | editor-link = Guy Scholefield | title = A Dictionary of New Zealand Biography : M–Addenda | volume = II | year = 1940 | publisher = [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of Internal Affairs]] | location = Wellington | url = https://www.nzhistory.net.nz/files/documents/dnzb-1940/scholefield-dnzb-v2.pdf | accessdate = 20 July 2015}}</ref> The second four members were [[Karaitiana Takamoana]] ([[Eastern Maori]]); [[Wi Katene]] ([[Northern Maori]]); [[Hori Kerei Taiaroa]] ([[Southern Maori]]); and [[Wiremu Parata]] ([[Western Maori]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/nga-mangai-maori-representation/page-1|title=1.  – Ngā māngai – Māori representation – Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-05-26}}</ref>

The first Māori woman MP was [[Iriaka Ratana]] who represented the enormous Western Māori electorate. Like [[Elizabeth McCombs]], New Zealand's first woman MP, Ratana won the seat in a hotly contested by-election caused by the death of her husband [[Matiu Rātana|Matiu]] in 1949.<ref>{{cite web|website=teara.govt.nz|title=First Māori woman MP (3rd of 4)|url= https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/28636/first-maori-woman-mp}}</ref>

===Elections===

Currently Māori elections are held as part of [[New Zealand elections|New Zealand general elections]] but in the past such elections took place separately, on different days (usually the day before the vote for general electorates) and under different rules. Historically, less organisation went into holding Māori elections than general elections, and the process received fewer resources. Māori electorates at first did not require registration for voting, which was later introduced. New practices such as [[ballot|paper ballots]] (as opposed to casting one's vote verbally) and [[secret ballot]]s also came later to elections for Māori electorates than to general electorates.

The authorities frequently delayed or overlooked reforms of the Māori electoral system, with Parliament considering the Māori electorates as largely unimportant. The gradual improvement of Māori elections owes much to long-serving Māori MP [[Eruera Tirikatene]], who himself experienced problems in his own election. From the [[1951 New Zealand general election|election of 1951]] onwards, the voting for Māori and general electorates was held on the same day.{{sfn|Wilson|1985|p=138}}

Confusion around the Māori electorates during the 2017 general election was revealed in a number of complaints to the Electoral Commission. Complaints included Electoral Commission staff at polling booths being unaware of the Māori roll and insisting electors were unregistered when their names did not appear on the general roll; Electoral Commission staff giving incorrect information about the Māori electorates; electors being given incorrect voting forms and electors being told they were unable to vote for the [[Māori Party]] unless they were on the Māori roll.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.maoritelevision.com/news/regional/polling-booth-staff-mislead-and-confuse-maori-voters|title=Polling booth staff mislead and confuse Māori voters |work=Māori Television|access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref>

==Calls for abolition==
Periodically there have been calls for the abolition of the Māori seats. The electorates aroused controversy even at the time of their origin, and given their intended temporary nature, there were a number of attempts to abolish them. The reasoning behind these attempts has varied – some have seen the electorates as an unfair or unnecessary advantage for Māori, while others have seen them as discriminatory and offensive.

In 1902, a consolidation of electoral law prompted considerable discussion of the Māori electorates, and some MPs proposed their abolition. Many of the proposals came from members of the [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]], and possibly had political motivations – in general, the Māori MPs had supported the governing [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], which had held power since 1891. Many MPs alleged frequent cases of corruption in elections for the Māori electorates. Other MPs, however, supported the abolition of Māori electorates for different reasons – [[Frederick Pirani]], a member of the Liberal Party, said that the absence of Māori voters from general electorates prevented "[[pākehā]] members of the House from taking that interest in Māori matters that they ought to take". The Māori MPs, however, mounted a strong defence of the electorates, with [[Wi Pere]] depicting guaranteed representation in Parliament as one of the few rights Māori possessed not "filched from them by the Europeans". The electorates continued in existence.

Just a short time later, in 1905, another re-arrangement of electoral law caused the debate to flare up again. The [[Minister of Māori Affairs]], [[James Carroll (New Zealand politician)|James Carroll]], supported proposals for the abolition of Māori electorates, pointing to the fact that he himself had won the general electorate of [[Waiapu (New Zealand electorate)|Waiapu]]. Other Māori MPs, such as [[Hone Heke Ngapua]], remained opposed, however. In the end, the proposals for the abolition or reform of Māori electorates did not proceed.

Considerably later, in 1953, the first ever major re-alignment of Māori electoral boundaries occurred, addressing inequalities in voter numbers. Again, the focus on Māori electorates prompted further debate about their existence. The government of the day, the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], had at the time a commitment to the assimilation of Māori, and had no Māori MPs, and so many believed that they would abolish the electorates. However, the government had other matters to attend to, and the issue of the Māori electorates gradually faded from view without any changes. Regardless, the possible abolition of the Māori electorates appeared indicated when they did not appear among the electoral provisions entrenched against future modification.

In the 1950s the practice of reserving electorates for Māori was described by some politicians "as a form of 'apartheid', like in South Africa".<ref>{{cite web |quote=In the 1950s and 1960s the National government occasionally talked of abolishing the [[Māori people|Māori]] seats. Some politicians described special representation as a form of 'apartheid', like in South Africa. |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/study/history/maori-vote.html |title=History of the Vote: Māori and the Vote |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429093638/http://www.elections.org.nz/study/history/maori-vote.html |archive-date=29 April 2007 |url-status=dead |website=Elections New Zealand |date=9 April 2005 |accessdate=3 November 2006 }}</ref>

In 1967, the electoral system whereby four electorate seats were reserved for representatives who were specifically Māori ended. Following the Electoral Amendment Act of 1967, the 100-year-old disqualification preventing Europeans from standing as candidates in Māori seats was removed. (The same Act allowed Māori to stand in European electorates.)

Since 1967, therefore, there has not been any electoral guarantee of representation by candidates who have Māori descent. While this still means that those elected to represent Māori electors in the Māori electorates are directly accountable to those voters{{clarify|date=August 2018}}, those representatives are not required to themselves be Māori.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/resource/en-NZ/00PLLawRP03141/e27e432e971eb1f60ea75b00c987a39e4b2e62ce|title=Origin of the Maori Seats|last=Wilson|first=John}}</ref>

In 1976, Māori gained the right for the first time to decide on which electoral roll they preferred to enrol. Surprisingly, only 40% of the potential population registered on the Māori roll. This reduced the number of calls for the abolition of Māori electorates, as many presumed that Māori would eventually abandon the Māori electorates of their own accord.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

However the 1977 electoral redistribution has been described as ''the most overtly political since the Representation Commission was established'' (through an amendment to the ''Representation Act'' in 1886); the option to decide which roll to go on was introduced by [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]]'s [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government]].{{sfn|McRobie |1989 |pp=8–9, 51, 119}} As part of the [[1976 New Zealand census|1976 census]], a large number of people failed to fill out an electoral re-registration card, and census staff had not been given the authority to insist on the card being completed. This had little practical effect for people on the general roll, but it transferred [[Māori people|Māori]] to the general roll if the card was not handed in.

When a Royal Commission proposed the adoption of the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] electoral system in 1986, it also proposed that if the country adopted the new system, it should abolish the Māori electorates. The Commission argued that under MMP, all parties would have to pay attention to Māori voters, and that the existence of separate Māori electorates marginalised Māori concerns. Following a [[New Zealand electoral reform|referendum]], Parliament drafted an Electoral Reform Bill, incorporating the abolition of the Māori electorates. Both the National Party and [[Geoffrey Palmer (politician)|Geoffrey Palmer]], Labour's leading reformist, supported abolition; but most Māori strongly opposed it. Eventually, the provision did not become law. The Māori electorates came closer than ever to abolition, but survived.

The [[ACT New Zealand|ACT Party]] and the National Party have each advocated abolition of the separate electorates. [[New Zealand First]] also advocates abolition of the separate electorates but says that the Māori voters should make the decision. National announced in 2008 it would abolish the electorates when all historic Treaty settlements have been resolved, which it aimed to complete by 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz-election-2008/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501799&objectid=10534713|title=National to dump Maori seats in 2014|last=Tahana|first=Yvonne |date=29 September 2008|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=28 December 2009}}</ref> While it remains National Party policy to abolish the electorates, Prime Minister John Key ruled it out as recently as August 2014, saying he would not do it even if he had the numbers to do so as there would be "[[hikoi]]s from hell".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11312498|title=John Key: Dropping Maori seats would mean 'hikois from hell'|date=22 August 2014|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref> However this policy may be changing. After Judith Collins replaced Todd Muller as Leader of the National Party in July 2020 she announced that "I am not opposed to the Māori seats. The National Party has had a view for many years now that they should be done away with. But I just want people to feel that they all have opportunities for representation".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300058752/judith-collins-keen-to-run-candidates-in-the-mori-seats-tear-up-the-rma-but-not-cut-benefits|title=Judith Collins keen to run candidates in the Māori seats, tear up the RMA, but not cut benefits|date=16 July 2020|work=Stuff News}}</ref>

During the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 election campaign]], the New Zealand First leader [[Winston Peters]] announced that if elected his party would hold two binding referendums on whether Maori electorates should be abolished and whether the number of MPs should be reduced to 100.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moir|first1=Jo|title=Winston Peters delivers bottom-line binding referendum on abolishing Maori seats|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/94776411/winston-peters-delivers-bottomline-binding-referendum-on-abolishing-maori-seats|accessdate=8 October 2017|publisher=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|date=16 July 2017}}</ref> The lobby group [[Hobson's Pledge]] advocates abolishing the allocated Māori seats, seeing them as outdated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maori seats outdated|url=http://www.hobsonspledge.nz/maori_seats_long_past_their_use_by_date|website=Hobson's Choice|accessdate=30 September 2016}}</ref> During post-election negotiations with the Labour Party, Peters indicated that he would consider dropping his call for a referendum on the Māori seats due to the defeat of the [[Māori Party]] at the 2017 election.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Burrows|first1=Matt|title=Winston Peters hints at U-turn on Māori seat referendum|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/09/winston-peters-hints-at-u-turn-on-maori-seat-referendum.html|accessdate=29 September 2017|publisher=[[Newshub]]|date=28 September 2017}}</ref> In return for forming a government with the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour Party]], NZ First agreed to drop its demand for referenda on abolishing the Māori electorates.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cheng|first1=Derek|title=Anti-smacking referendum dropped during coalition negotiations|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11938679|accessdate=1 November 2017|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=30 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Guy|first1=Alice|title=Local kaumatua not surprised Maori seats will be retained|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/rotorua-daily-post/news/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503437&objectid=11935171|accessdate=4 November 2017|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=21 October 2017}}</ref>

==Number of electorates==

From 1868 to 1996, four Māori electorates existed (out of a total that slowly changed from 76 to 99).<ref name="General elections 1853-2005">{{cite web |title=General elections 1853–2005 – dates & turnout |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/elections/resultsdata/elections-dates-turnout.html |publisher=Elections New Zealand |accessdate=6 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527022404/http://www.elections.org.nz/elections/resultsdata/elections-dates-turnout.html |archivedate=27 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> They comprised:<ref name="Scholefield">{{cite book |last= Scholefield |first= Guy |title= New Zealand Parliamentary Record, 1840–1949 |authorlink=Guy Scholefield |edition=3rd |origyear= First ed. published 1913 |year= 1950 |publisher=Govt.

With the introduction of the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] electoral system after 1993, the rules regarding the Māori electorates changed. Today, the number of electorates floats, meaning that the electoral population of a Māori seat can remain roughly equivalent to that of a general seat. In the first MMP vote (the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 election]]), the Electoral Commission defined five Māori electorates: 
# [[Te Puku O Te Whenua]] ''(The belly of the land)''
# [[Te Tai Hauauru]] ''(The western district)''
# [[Te Tai Rawhiti]] ''(The eastern district)''
# [[Te Tai Tokerau]] ''(The northern district)''
# [[Te Tai Tonga]] ''(The southern district)''

A sixth Māori electorate was added for the second MMP election in [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999]]:
# [[Hauraki Maori (New Zealand electorate)|Hauraki]]
# [[Ikaroa-Rāwhiti (New Zealand electorate)|Ikaroa-Rawhiti]]
# [[Te Tai Hauāuru]]
# [[Te Tai Tokerau (New Zealand electorate)|Te Tai Tokerau]]
# [[Te Tai Tonga (New Zealand electorate)|Te Tai Tonga]]
# [[Waiariki (New Zealand electorate)|Waiariki]]

Since [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002]], there have been seven Māori electorates. For the 2002 and [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 elections]], these were:
# [[Ikaroa-Rāwhiti (New Zealand electorate)|Ikaroa-Rāwhiti]]
# [[Tainui (New Zealand electorate)|Tainui]]
# [[Tāmaki Makaurau (New Zealand electorate)|Tāmaki Makaurau]] (roughly equivalent to greater [[Auckland]])
# [[Te Tai Hauāuru]]
# [[Te Tai Tokerau (New Zealand electorate)|Te Tai Tokerau]]
# [[Te Tai Tonga (New Zealand electorate)|Te Tai Tonga]]
# [[Waiariki (New Zealand electorate)|Waiariki]]

From [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]], Tainui was largely replaced by Hauraki-Waikato, giving the following seven Māori electorates:
# [[Hauraki-Waikato (New Zealand electorate)|Hauraki-Waikato]] –  ''(North Western [[North Island]], includes [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and [[Papakura District|Papakura]])''
# [[Ikaroa-Rāwhiti (New Zealand electorate)|Ikaroa-Rāwhiti]] – ''(East and South [[North Island]], includes [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] and [[Masterton]])''
# [[Tāmaki Makaurau (New Zealand electorate)|Tāmaki Makaurau]] – ''(Roughly equivalent to greater [[Auckland]])''
# [[Te Tai Hauāuru]] – ''(Western [[North Island]], includes [[Taranaki]] and [[Manawatū-Whanganui]] regions)''
# [[Te Tai Tokerau (New Zealand electorate)|Te Tai Tokerau]] – ''(Northernmost seat, includes [[Whangārei]] and North and West [[Auckland]])''
# [[Te Tai Tonga (New Zealand electorate)|Te Tai Tonga]] – ''(All of [[South Island]] and nearby islands. Largest electorate by area)''
# [[Waiariki (New Zealand electorate)|Waiariki]] – ''(Includes [[Tauranga]], [[Whakatane]], [[Rotorua]], [[Taupo]])''

While seven out of 70 (10%) does not nearly reflect the proportion of New Zealanders who identify as being of Māori descent (about 18%), many Māori choose to enroll in general electorates, so the proportion reflects the proportion of voters on the Māori roll.

==Party politics==
As Māori electorates originated before the development of [[political parties in New Zealand]], all early Māori MPs functioned as [[Independent (politics)|independents]]. When the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] formed, however, Māori MPs began to align themselves with the new organisation, with either Liberal candidates or Liberal sympathisers as representatives. Māori MPs in the Liberal Party included [[James Carroll (New Zealand politician)|James Carroll]], [[Āpirana Ngata]] and [[Te Rangi Hīroa]]. There were also Māori MPs in the more conservative and rural [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform Party]]; [[Maui Pomare]], [[Taurekareka Henare]] and [[Taite Te Tomo]].

Since the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] first came to power in [[1935 New Zealand general election|1935]], however, it has dominated the Māori electorates. For a long period this dominance owed much to Labour's alliance with the [[Rātana|Rātana Church]], although the Rātana influence has diminished in recent times. In the [[1993 New Zealand general election|1993 election]], however, the new [[New Zealand First]] party, led by the part-Māori [[Winston Peters]] – who himself held the general seat of [[Tauranga (New Zealand electorate)|Tauranga]] from 1984 to 2005 – gained the Northern Māori seat (electing [[Tau Henare]] to Parliament), and in the [[1996 New Zealand general election|1996 election]] New Zealand First captured all the Māori electorates for one electoral term. Labour regained the electorates in the following election in the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]].{{sfn|Bargh|2015|pp=302–303}}

A development of particular interest to Māori came in 2004 with the resignation of [[Tariana Turia]] from her ministerial position in the Labour-dominated coalition and from her [[Te Tai Hauāuru]] parliamentary seat. In [[2004 Te Tai Hauauru by-election|the resulting by-election]] on 10 July 2004, standing under the banner of the newly formed [[Māori Party]], she received over 90% of the 7,000-plus votes cast. The parties then represented in Parliament had not put up official candidates in the by-election. The new party's support in relation to Labour therefore remained untested at the polling booth.{{sfn|Bargh|2015|pp=305–306}}

The Māori Party aimed to win all seven Māori electorates in [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005]]. A [[Marae-Digipoll]] survey of Māori-roll voters in November 2004 gave it hope: 35.7% said they would vote for a Māori Party candidate, 26.3% opted for Labour, and five of the seven electorates appeared ready to fall to the new party.<ref>{{cite news|title=Marae DigiPoll1_02.03.08|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/tvone_minisite_story_skin/1615176|accessdate=8 October 2017|publisher=[[Television New Zealand|TVNZ]]|date=2 March 2008}}</ref> In the election, the new party won four of the Māori electorates. It seemed possible that Māori Party MPs could play a role in the choice and formation of a governing coalition, and they conducted talks with the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]. In the end they remained in Opposition.{{sfn|Godfery|2015|pp=243–244}}

Similarly in [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]], the Māori Party aimed to win all seven Māori electorates. However, in the election, they managed to increase their four electorates only to five. Although the National government had enough MPs to govern without the Māori Party, it invited the Māori Party to support their minority government on confidence and supply in return for policy concessions and two ministerial posts outside of Cabinet. The Māori Party signed a confidence and supply agreement with National on the condition that the Māori electorates were not abolished unless the Māori voters agreed to abolish them. Other policy concessions including a review of the [[Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004]], a review of New Zealand's constitutional arrangements, and the introduction of the [[Whānau Ora]] indigenous health initiative.{{sfn|Godfery|2015|pp=244–245}}

Discontentment with the Māori Party's support agreement with National particularly the [[Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011|Marine and Coastal Areas Bill 2011]] led the party's [[Te Tai Tokerau]] Member [[Hone Harawira]] to secede from the Māori Party and form the radical left-wing [[Mana Movement]]. During the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]], the Māori Party retained three of the Māori electorates while Labour increased its share of the Māori electorates to three, taking [[Te Tai Tonga]]. The Mana Movement retained Te Tai Tokerau. Tensions between the Māori Party and Mana Movement combined with competition from the Labour Party fragmented the Māori political voice  in Parliament.{{sfn|Godfery|2015|pp=245–248}}{{sfn|Bargh|2015|p=305}}
