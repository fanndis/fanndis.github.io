== Etymology ==
In the 1st century, the use of the Latin word "''plagiarius"'' (literally "kidnapper") to denote stealing someone else's [[Creative work|work]] was pioneered by the Roman poet [[Martial]], who complained that another poet had "kidnapped his verses". ''Plagiary'', a derivative of ''plagiarus'', was introduced into English in 1601 by dramatist [[Ben Jonson]] during the [[Jacobean Era]] to describe someone guilty of literary theft.<ref name="Lynch02">Lynch (2002)</ref><ref name="Valpy05">{{Cite book | last=Valpy | first=Francis Edward Jackson | date=2005 | title=Etymological Dictionary of the Latin Language | page=345 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsWzg7rTEa4C&q=etymology+plaga+net&pg=PA345 | quote=entry for ''plagium'', quotation: "the crime of kidnapping."| isbn=9781402173844 }}</ref>

The derived form ''plagiarism'' was introduced into English around 1620.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=plagiarism |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=April 24, 2011}}</ref> The [[Latin]] ''plagiārius'', "kidnapper", and ''plagium'', "kidnapping", have the root ''plaga'' ("snare", "net"), based on the [[Proto-Indo-European root|Indo-European root]] ''*-plak'', "to weave" (seen for instance in [[Greek language|Greek]] ''plekein'', Bulgarian "плета" ''pleta'', and Latin ''plectere'', all meaning "to weave").

== Legal aspects ==

Although plagiarism in some contexts is considered theft or stealing, the concept does not exist in a legal sense, although the use of someone else's work in order to gain academic credit may meet some legal definitions of [[fraud]].<ref name="link.springer.com">{{cite book|title=Handbook of Academic Integrity|first1=Philip M.|last1=Newton|first2=Christopher|last2=Lang|editor-first=Tracey|editor-last=Bretag|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Springer Singapore|pages=249–271|doi=10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38|chapter = Custom Essay Writers, Freelancers, and Other Paid Third Parties|isbn = 978-981-287-097-1}}</ref>  "Plagiarism" specifically is not mentioned in any current statute, either [[Criminal law|criminal]] or [[Civil law (common law)|civil]].<ref name="Lands99">Lands, Robert (1999) [http://www.theaoi.com/articles/texts/1999/decplagiarism.html ''Plagiarism is no Crime''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101213001/http://www.theaoi.com/articles/texts/1999/decplagiarism.html |date=2011-01-01 }} published by The Association of Illustrators (AOI), December 1999.

Plagiarism is not the same as [[copyright infringement]]. While both terms may apply to a particular act, they are different concepts, and false claims of authorship generally constitute plagiarism regardless of whether the material is protected by copyright. Copyright infringement is a violation of the rights of a copyright holder, when material whose use is restricted by copyright is used without consent. Plagiarism, in contrast, is concerned with the unearned increment to the plagiarizing author's reputation, or the obtaining of academic credit, that is achieved through false claims of authorship. Thus, plagiarism is considered a moral offense against the plagiarist's audience (for example, a reader, listener, or teacher).

Plagiarism is also considered a moral offense against anyone who has provided the plagiarist with a benefit in exchange for what is specifically supposed to be original content (for example, the plagiarist's publisher, employer, or teacher). In such cases,  acts of plagiarism may sometimes also form part of a claim for [[breach of contract|breach]] of the plagiarist's contract, or, if done knowingly, for a [[civil wrong]].

== In academia and journalism ==
Within [[academia]], plagiarism by students, professors, or researchers is considered [[academic dishonesty]] or academic fraud, and offenders are subject to academic censure, up to and including [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]]. Some institutions use [[Plagiarism detection|plagiarism detection software]] to uncover potential plagiarism and to deter students from plagiarizing. However, plagiarism detection software doesn't always yield accurate results and there are loopholes in these systems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weber-Wulff|first=Debora|date=2019-03-27|title=Plagiarism detectors are a crutch, and a problem|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=567|issue=7749|pages=435|doi=10.1038/d41586-019-00893-5|pmid=30918394|bibcode=2019Natur.567..435W|s2cid=85527772}}</ref> Some universities address the issue of academic integrity by providing students with thorough orientations, required writing courses, and clearly articulated honor codes.<ref name=aboutcampus>{{cite journal|title=The Responsible Plagiarist: Understanding Students Who Misuse Sources|author=Abigail Lipson|author2=Sheila M.

An extreme form of plagiarism, known as [[contract cheating]] involves students paying someone else, such as an [[essay mill]], to do their work for them.<ref name="link.springer.com"/>

In [[journalism]], plagiarism is considered a breach of [[journalistic ethics]], and reporters caught plagiarizing typically face disciplinary measures ranging from suspension to termination of employment.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1541-4337.2010.00113.x|title=Editorial:Some Thoughts on Plagiarism|first=Manfred|last=Kroger|date=2010|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|volume=9|issue=3|pages=259–260}}</ref> Some individuals caught plagiarizing in academic or journalistic contexts claim that they plagiarized unintentionally, by failing to include [[quotation]]s or give the appropriate [[citation]].

=== Academia ===
[[File:Example-of-Article-Plagiarism-Diagram.png|thumb|One form of academic plagiarism involves appropriating a published article and modifying it slightly to avoid suspicion.]] No universally adopted definition of academic plagiarism exists<ref name=":2" /> however, this section provides several definitions to exemplify the most common characteristics of academic plagiarism. It has been called, "The use of ideas, concepts, words, or structures  without appropriately acknowledging the source  to benefit in a setting where originality is expected."<ref name="Gipp14">{{cite book|last=Gipp|first=Bela|url=https://www.springer.com/springer+vieweg/it+%26+informatik/k%C3%BCnstliche+intelligenz/book/978-3-658-06393-1|title=Citation-based Plagiarism Detection: Detecting Disguised and Cross-language Plagiarism using Citation Pattern Analysis|publisher=Springer Vieweg|year=2014|isbn=978-3-658-06393-1}} p.10</ref>

This is an abridged version of Teddi Fishman's definition of plagiarism, which proposed five elements characteristic of plagiarism.<ref name="Fishman09">{{cite news | last = Fishman | first = Teddi | url = http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/09-4apcei/4apcei-Fishman.pdf |title=We know it when we see it is not good enough: toward a standard definition of plagiarism that transcends theft, fraud, and copyright | publisher = Proceedings of the 4th Asia Pacific Conference on Educational Integrity |date=Sep 28–30, 2009}} p.5</ref> According to Fishman, plagiarism occurs when someone:
#  Uses words, ideas, or work products
#  Attributable to another identifiable person or source
#  Without attributing the work to the source from which it was obtained
#  In a situation in which there is a legitimate expectation of original authorship
#  In order to obtain some benefit, credit, or gain which need not be monetary<ref name="Fishman09" />

Furthermore, plagiarism is defined differently among institutions of higher learning and universities:

* [[Stanford University|Stanford]] defines plagiarism as the "use, without giving reasonable and appropriate credit to or acknowledging the author or source, of another person's original work, whether such work is made up of code, formulas, ideas, language, research, strategies, writing or other form."<ref>[https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/what-plagiarism "What is Plagiarism?"] Stanford University.</ref>
* [[Yale University|Yale]] views plagiarism as the "... use of another's work, words, or ideas without attribution," which includes "... using a source's language without quoting, using information from a source without attribution, and paraphrasing a source in a form that stays too close to the original."<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/writing/using-sources/understanding-and-avoiding-plagiarism/what-plagiarism | title=What is Plagiarism? &#124; Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning}}</ref>

==== Forms of academic plagiarism ====

Different classifications of academic plagiarism forms have been proposed. Many classifications follow a behavioral approach, i.e., they seek to classify the actions undertaken by plagiarists.

For example, a 2015 survey of teachers and professors by [[Turnitin]],<ref>{{cite web |title=The Plagiarism Spectrum |url=http://go.turnitin.com/paper/plagiarism-spectrum |publisher=Turnitin |access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> identified 10 main forms of plagiarism that students commit:<!--THERE ARE PUBLISHED WORKS ON THIS, WHY ARE WE CITING THIS LOCAL UNIVERSITY WEB INFORMATION? SEE LIPSON'S WORK AT https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Honest-Work-College-Plagiarism/dp/0226484777, AND OTHER SUCH SOURCES.-->

# Submitting someone's work as their own.
# Taking passages from their own previous work without adding citations (self-plagiarism).
# Re-writing someone's work without properly citing sources.
# Using quotations but not citing the source.
# Interweaving various sources together in the work without citing.
# Citing some, but not all, passages that should be cited.
# Melding together cited and uncited sections of the piece.
# Providing proper citations, but failing to change the structure and wording of the borrowed ideas enough (close paraphrasing).
# Inaccurately citing a source.
# Relying too heavily on other people's work, failing to bring original thought into the text.

A 2019 [[Systematic review|systematic literature review]] on academic [[plagiarism detection]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Foltýnek|first1=Tomáš|last2=Meuschke|first2=Norman|last3=Gipp|first3=Bela|date=2019-10-16|title=Academic Plagiarism Detection: A Systematic Literature Review|journal=ACM Computing Surveys|language=en|volume=52|issue=6|pages=1–42|doi=10.1145/3345317|doi-access=free}}</ref> deductively derived a technically oriented typology of academic plagiarism from the linguistic model of language consisting of [[Lexis (linguistics)|lexis]], [[syntax]], and [[semantics]] extended by a fourth layer to capture the plagiarism of ideas and structures. The typology categorizes plagiarism forms according to the layer of the model they affect:

* Characters-preserving plagiarism
**Verbatim copying without proper citation
* Syntax-preserving plagiarism
**Synonym substitution
**Technical disguise (e.g. using identically looking [[glyph]]s from another [[alphabet]])
* Semantics-preserving plagiarism
**Translation
**[[Paraphrase]]
* Idea-preserving plagiarism
**Appropriation of ideas or concepts
**Reusing text structure
* Ghostwriting
**[[Collusion]] (typically among students)

In the academic world, plagiarism by students is usually considered a very serious offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution.<ref name="bbc.com"/> The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study did not have a good understanding of even the basic requirements of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were very confident that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education|journal = Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education|first=Philip|last=Newton|date=2 April 2016|volume=41|issue=3|pages=482–497|doi=10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199|s2cid = 144164927|url = https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa20205/Download/0020205-17042015081413.pdf}}</ref> The same students also had a lenient view of how plagiarism should be penalised.

For cases of repeated plagiarism, or for cases in which a student commits severe plagiarism (e.g., purchasing an assignment), suspension or [[Expulsion (education)|expulsion]] may occur. There has been historic concern about inconsistencies in penalties administered for university student plagiarism, and a plagiarism tariff was devised in 2008 for UK higher education institutions in an attempt to encourage some standardization of approaches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.plagiarismadvice.org/BTariff.pdf |title=Benchmark Plagiarism Tariff |first1=Peter |last1=Tennant |first2=Gill |last2=Rowell |year=2009–2010 |website=plagiarism advice.org |publisher=iParadigms Europe |access-date=9 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222041912/http://archive.plagiarismadvice.org/BTariff.pdf |archive-date=22 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

However, to impose sanctions, plagiarism needs to be detected. Strategies faculty members use to detect plagiarism include carefully reading students work and making note of inconsistencies in student writing, citation errors and providing plagiarism prevention education to students.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal|author=Colella-Sandercock, J.

==== Plagiarism education ====
Given the serious consequences that plagiarism has for students, there has been a call for a greater emphasis on learning in order to help students avoid committing plagiarism.<ref name="ireland">{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264452242|title=Let Them Plagiarise: Developing Academic Writing in a Safe Environment|journal=Journal of Academic Writing|first1=Chris|last1=Ireland|first2=University of|last2=Huddersfield|last3=UK|first4=John|last4=English|first5=University of|last5=Huddersfield|last6=UK|date=1 October 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=165–172|doi=10.18552/joaw.v1i1.10}}</ref><ref>Leung, C.

==== Factors influencing students' decision to plagiarize ====
Several studies investigated factors that influence the decision to plagiarize. For example, a panel study with students from German universities found that academic procrastination predicts the frequency plagiarism conducted within six months followed the measurement of academic procrastination.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Patrzek | first1 = J. | last2 = Sattler | first2 = S. | last3 = van Veen | first3 = F. | last4 = Grunschel | first4 = C. | last5 = Fries | first5 = S. | year = 2014 | title = Investigating the Effect of Academic Procrastination on the Frequency and Variety of Academic Misconduct: A Panel Study | journal = Studies in Higher Education | volume = 40| issue = 6| pages = 1–16| doi = 10.1080/03075079.2013.854765 | s2cid = 144324180 }}</ref> It has been argued that by plagiarizing students cope with the negative consequences that result from academic procrastination such as poor grades. Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent if students perceive plagiarism as beneficial and if they have the opportunity to plagiarize.<ref>Sebastian Sattler, Peter Graeff, Sebastian Willen: ''Explaining the Decision to Plagiarize: An Empirical Test of the Interplay Between Rationality, Norms, and Opportunity.'' In: ''Deviant Behavior.'' 34, 2013, S.&nbsp;444–463, [[doi:10.1080/01639625.2012.735909]].</ref> When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable, plagiarism was less likely to occur. Another study found that students resorted to plagiarism in order to cope with heavy workloads imposed by teachers. On the other hand, in that study, some teachers also thought that plagiarism is a consequence of their own failure to propose creative tasks and activities.<ref>Arce Espinoza, L., & Monge Nájera, J. (2015). How to correct teaching methods that favour plagiarism: recommendations from teachers and students in a Spanish language distance education university. ''Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education'', ''40''(8), 1070-1078.</ref>

=== Journalism ===
Since journalism relies on the public trust, a reporter's failure to honestly acknowledge their sources undercuts a newspaper or television news show's integrity and undermines its credibility. Journalists accused of plagiarism are often suspended from their reporting tasks while the charges are being investigated by the news organization.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.famousplagiarists.com/journalism.htm |title=Journalism  |website=Famous Plagiarists.com / War On Plagiarism.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226090147/http://famousplagiarists.com/journalism.htm |archive-date=26 February 2007|access-date=9 August 2013}}</ref>

=== Self-plagiarism ===

{{Split section|Self-plagiarism|discuss=Talk:Plagiarism#January 2013 proposal to split off 'self-plagiarism'|date=April 2020}}
The reuse of significant, identical, or nearly identical portions of one's own work without acknowledging that one is doing so or citing the original work is sometimes described as "self-plagiarism"; the term "recycling fraud" has also been used to describe this practice.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dellavalle | first1 = Robert P. | last2 = Banks | first2 = Marcus A. | last3 = Ellis | first3 = Jeffrey I. |date=September 2007 | title = Frequently asked questions regarding self-plagiarism: How to avoid recycling fraud | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | page = 527 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2007.05.018 | pmid = 17707155 | pmc = 2679117 }}</ref> Articles of this nature are often referred to as duplicate or [[multiple publication]]. In addition there can be a copyright issue if copyright of the prior work has been transferred to another entity. Self-plagiarism is considered a serious ethical issue in settings where someone asserts that a publication consists of new material, such as in publishing or factual documentation.<ref>Rebecca Attwood. [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=402598 "Allow me to rephrase, and boost my tally of articles"].

In academic fields, self-plagiarism occurs when an author reuses portions of their own published and copyrighted work in subsequent publications, but without attributing the previous publication.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hexham |first=Irving |year=2005 |title=The Plague of Plagiarism: Academic Plagiarism Defined |website=UCalgary.ca |url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~hexham/content/articles/plague-of-plagiarism.html}}</ref><ref name=":1">Roig, M.

==== Contested definition ====
Miguel Roig has written at length about the topic of self-plagiarism<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{cite journal|author=Roig, M.|date=2005|title=Re-Using Text from One's Own Previously Published Papers: An Exploratory Study of Potential Self-Plagiarism|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=97|issue=1|pages=43–49|doi=10.2466/pr0.97.1.43-49|pmid=16279303|s2cid=8894524}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ori.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/plagiarism.pdf|author=Roig, M.|date=2015|orig-year=Created in 2003|title=Avoiding plagiarism, self-plagiarism, and other questionable writing practices: A guide to ethical writing}}<br />{{cite web|url=https://ori.hhs.gov/avoiding-plagiarism-self-plagiarism-and-other-questionable-writing-practices-guide-ethical-writing|title=Avoiding Plagiarism, Self-plagiarism, and Other Questionable Writing Practices: A Guide to Ethical Writing|publisher=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services: Office of Research Integrity}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aaas.org/news/reusing-our-previously-disseminated-work|author=Roig, M.|date=8 January 2015|title=On Reusing Our Previously Disseminated Work|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science}}</ref> and his definition of self-plagiarism as using previously disseminated work is widely accepted among scholars of the topic. However, the term "self-plagiarism" has been challenged as being self-contradictory, an [[oxymoron]],<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Broome | first1 = M | title = Self-plagiarism: Oxymoron, fair use, or scientific misconduct? | doi = 10.1016/j.outlook.2004.10.001 | journal = Nursing Outlook | volume = 52 | issue = 6 | pages = 273–4 |date=November 2004 | pmid = 15614263 }}</ref> and on other grounds.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Andreescu | first1 = Liviu | title = Self-Plagiarism in Academic Publishing: The Anatomy of a Misnomer | doi = 10.1007/s11948-012-9416-1 | pmid = 23179068 | journal = Science and Engineering Ethics | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 775–797 |date=November 2012| s2cid = 11346908 }}</ref>

For example, Stephanie J. Bird<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bird | first1 = SJ | title = Self-plagiarism and dual and redundant publications: what is the problem? Commentary on 'Seven ways to plagiarize: handling real allegations of research misconduct' | doi = 10.1007/s11948-002-0007-4 | journal = Science and Engineering Ethics | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 543–4 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12501723 | s2cid = 26471653 }}</ref> argues that self-plagiarism is a misnomer, since by definition plagiarism concerns the use of others' material. Bird identifies the ethical issues of "self-plagiarism" as those of "dual or redundant publication". She also notes that in an educational context, "self-plagiarism" refers to the case of a student who resubmits "the same essay for credit in two different courses." As David B. Resnik clarifies, "Self-plagiarism involves dishonesty but not intellectual theft."<ref>Resnik, David B. (1998). ''The Ethics of Science: an introduction'', London: Routledge. p.177, notes to chapter six, note 3. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zMn2KxPQyk8C&lpg=PA177&dq=%22self-plagiarism%22&lr=&pg=PA177 Online via Google Books]</ref>

According to Patrick M. Scanlon,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Scanlon, PM | year = 2007 | title = Song from myself: an anatomy of self-plagiarism | journal = Plagiary | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 |hdl = 2027/spo.5240451.0002.007}}</ref>
"self-plagiarism" is a term with some specialized currency. Most prominently, it is used in discussions of research and publishing integrity in biomedicine, where heavy publish-or-perish demands have led to a rash of duplicate and "salami-slicing" publication, the reporting of a single study's results in "[[least publishable unit]]s" within multiple articles (Blancett, Flanagin, & Young, 1995; Jefferson, 1998; Kassirer & Angell, 1995; Lowe, 2003; McCarthy, 1993; Schein & Paladugu, 2001; Wheeler, 1989). Roig (2002) offers a useful classification system including four types of self-plagiarism: duplicate publication of an article in more than one journal; partitioning of one study into multiple publications, often called salami-slicing; text recycling; and copyright infringement.

==== Codes of ethics ====
Some academic journals have codes of ethics that specifically refer to self-plagiarism. For example, the ''Journal of International Business Studies''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Lorraine Eden |url=http://palgrave-journals.com/jibs/jibs_ethics_code.html |title=JIBS Code of Ethics |publisher=Journal of International Business Studies |access-date=2010-08-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723212122/http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jibs/jibs_ethics_code.html |archive-date=2010-07-23 }}</ref> Some professional organizations like the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) have created policies that deal specifically with self-plagiarism.<ref>{{cite web |date=June 2010 | title = ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism | url=http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy}}</ref> Other organizations do not make specific reference to self-plagiarism such as the American Political Science Association (APSA). The organization published a code of ethics that describes plagiarism as "...deliberate appropriation of the works of others represented as one's own." It does not make any reference to self-plagiarism. It does say that when a thesis or dissertation is published "in whole or in part", the author is "not ordinarily under an ethical obligation to acknowledge its origins."<ref>American Political Science Association (2008). [http://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/ethicsguideweb.pdf "A Guide to Professional Ethics in Political Science"]. Second Edition. Section 21.1. {{ISBN|1-878147-05-6}}</ref> The American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) also published a code of ethics that says its members are committed to: "Ensure that others receive credit for their work and contributions," but it makes no reference to self-plagiarism.<ref>American Society for Public Administration. [http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/index_codeofethics.cfm "ASPA's Code of Ethics"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124015330/http://www.aspanet.org/scriptcontent/index_codeofethics.cfm |date=2011-01-24 }}</ref>

==== Factors that justify reuse ====
[[Pamela Samuelson]], in 1994, identified several factors she says excuse reuse of one's previously published work, that make it not self-plagiarism.<ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /> She relates each of these factors specifically to the ethical issue of self-plagiarism, as distinct from the legal issue of fair use of copyright, which she deals with separately. Among other factors that may excuse reuse of previously published material Samuelson lists the following:

# The previous work must be restated to lay the groundwork for a new contribution in the second work.
# Portions of the previous work must be repeated to deal with new evidence or arguments.
# The audience for each work is so different that publishing the same work in different places is necessary to get the message out.
# The author thinks they said it so well the first time that it makes no sense to say it differently a second time.

Samuelson states she has relied on the "different audience" rationale when attempting to bridge interdisciplinary communities. She refers to writing for different legal and technical communities, saying: "there are often paragraphs or sequences of paragraphs that can be bodily lifted from one article to the other. And, in truth, I lift them." She refers to her own practice of converting "a technical article into a law review article with relatively few changes—adding footnotes and one substantive section" for a different audience.<ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" />

Samuelson describes misrepresentation as the basis of self-plagiarism.<ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" /> She also states "Although it seems not to have been raised in any of the self-plagiarism cases, copyrights law's fair use defense would likely provide a shield against many potential publisher claims of copyright infringement against authors who reused portions of their previous works."<ref name="Samuelson, Pamela. (1994)" />

=== Organizational publications ===
Plagiarism is presumably not an issue when organizations issue collective unsigned works since they do not assign credit for originality to particular people. For example, the [[American Historical Association]]'s "Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct" (2005) regarding textbooks and reference books states that, since textbooks and encyclopedias are summaries of other scholars' work, they are not bound by the same exacting standards of attribution as original research and may be allowed a greater "extent of dependence" on other works.<ref name=AHA>{{cite web | url = http://www.historians.org/PUBS/Free/ProfessionalStandards.cfm | title = Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct | date = 2005-01-06 | access-date=2009-04-16 | publisher = American Historical Association}}</ref> However, even such a book does not make use of words, phrases, or paragraphs from another text or follow too closely the other text's arrangement and organization, and the authors of such texts are also expected to "acknowledge the sources of recent or distinctive findings and interpretations, those not yet a part of the common understanding of the profession."<ref name=AHA />

Ruth Graham quotes [[T. S. Eliot]]—"Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal.

<blockquote>Sterne's Writings, in which it is clearly shewn, that he, whose manner and style were so long thought original, was, in fact, the most unhesitating plagiarist who ever cribbed from his predecessors in order to garnish his own pages. It must be owned, at the same time, that Sterne selects the materials of his mosaic work with so much art, places them so well, and polishes them so highly, that in most cases we are disposed to pardon the want of originality, in consideration of the exquisite talent with which the borrowed materials are wrought up into the new form.<ref>[[Oliver Goldsmith]] [https://archive.org/details/vicarwakefielda22goldgoog The vicar of Wakefield: a tale, Volume 5] p.xviii</ref></blockquote>
