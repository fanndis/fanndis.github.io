[[George W. Bush administration]] archives, February 27, 2006. Hosted at [https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/ Archives.gov]. Accessed January 19, 2014.</ref> (born July 30, 1973) is an [[United States|American]] [[bank]]er and [[politician]] who is President of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]]. As interim [[Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Stability]] from October 2008 to May 2009, he oversaw the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) that was a major component of the U.S. government's response to the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he unsuccessfully ran for [[Governor of California]] in the [[California gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 election]].

Born and raised in Ohio, and educated at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], Kashkari worked initially as an aerospace engineer. After attending business school at the [[Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he became an [[investment banker]], covering the information technology security sector for [[Goldman Sachs]].

[[Henry Paulson]], the former head of Goldman, and then [[Secretary of the Treasury]], hired Kashkari on as an aide. Kashkari was eventually named Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Economics and Development. At Treasury, he played a number of roles in the response to the financial crisis and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] that preceded it, most notably administering the TARP.

Kashkari left government and began working for [[Pimco]] in 2009, leading that company's push into the [[Equity (finance)|equities]] market. Following little success in that endeavour, he resigned from Pimco in January 2013 to explore a run for public office. One year later, he announced his candidacy for [[Governor of California]]. He came in second in California's [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] but lost the [[2014 California gubernatorial election|general election]] to incumbent governor [[Jerry Brown]].

He was named the new president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve November 10, 2015, succeeding [[Narayana Kocherlakota]] who announced his resignation in June. Minneapolis, which was last an [[Federal Open Market Committee|FOMC]] voting member in 2017, will next be a voting member in 2020.

===A growing crisis===
By the summer 2007, concerns over the credit quality of private-label securitizations, underwriting standards and institutional solvency accelerated. The value of unconventional [[Mortgage-backed security|financial instruments]] backed by U.S. [[subprime mortgages]] declined sharply as it became clear that many of the borrowers would continue to [[Default (finance)|default]] on the mortgages. This caused a housing glut and [[Subprime mortgage crisis|crisis]] as the banks holding the mortgages saw their assets decline in value and rushed to [[foreclose]] the loans. This ultimately intensified into a [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]] with broad implications.<ref>For a detailed account, see Sorkin.</ref>

Kashkari played important roles in several episodes of the crisis. He led Treasury's participation in the [[Hope Now Alliance]], a mortgage industry initiative coordinated by the federal government that aimed to reduce foreclosures by modifying loan terms on a loan-by-loan basis.<ref name="rosenwald wapo"/><ref>Jeanne Sahadi.

In March 2008, Kashkari began to worry that, if the Bush administration never received the authority it needed to deal with the growing crisis, the next administration would blame them for everything wrong in the economy. Paulson scoffed at this idea, particularly Kashkari's speculation that [[Barack Obama]], then a candidate in [[2008 United States presidential election|that year's presidential election]], would win the presidency and use the crisis to ride to popularity just as former President [[Ronald Reagan]] had following the [[Iran hostage crisis]].<ref>Sorkin, pp. 92–3.</ref>

===TARP===
In early 2008, Paulson directed Kashkari and fellow Treasury aide [[Phillip Swagel]] to write a plan to recapitalize the banking system in case the crisis worsened.<ref>Sorkin, pp. 83–4.</ref> The plan called for Congress to authorize Treasury to spend $500 billion to buy mortgage-backed securities from troubled banks, replacing them on banks' balance sheets with safe, [[Market liquidity|liquid]] [[Treasury bill]]s. This would prevent [[Bank run|runs on the banks]] and encourage them to lend. The plan was conceived as an alternative to proposals from the staff of the [[House Financial Services Committee]], then led by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Representative [[Barney Frank]].<ref>[[David Wessel]]. ''In Fed We Trust''. [[Crown Business]], 2010, pp. 176–7.</ref>

Following the [[Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers|collapse]] of the investment bank [[Lehman Brothers]] on September 15, 2008, the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] (EESA) was enacted on October 3. Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress voted for the law. Kashkari was one of several Paulson aides who was heavily involved in the crafting the legislation.<ref>[[Mark Landler]], [[Edmund L. Andrews]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/business/economy/04plan.html For Treasury Dept., now comes hard part of bailout]. ''The New York Times'', October 4, 2008. Accessed January 2, 2014.</ref> Based in large part on Kashkari and Swagel's recapitalization plan, the EESA created the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP), a $700 billion bailout fund for financial institutions threatened with collapse.<ref name="blumenfeld wapo"/> Kashkari initially proposed a $1 trillion fund, but Paulson vetoed that number as too large. Kashkari came up with the lesser figure of $700 billion by taking 5% of the $14 trillion in then-outstanding mortgages in the United States.<ref>Sorkin, p. 450</ref>

To administer TARP, the EESA created within the Treasury Department a new Office of Financial Stability to be headed by an [[Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Stability]], who would be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. However, it also specified that the Treasury Secretary could designate an interim Assistant Secretary to run the office. Kashkari first came to widespread public attention on October 6, 2008, when Paulson named him to this position.<ref name="rucker reuters">Patrick Rucker.

Accessed January 3, 2014.</ref> During his time running TARP he retained his title as Assistant Secretary for International Economics and Development, but his international affairs responsibilities were delegated to another Treasury official.<ref name="treasury bio"/>

==== Primary election ====

Brown was widely expected to finish first in the primary, so Kashkari's principal opponent at this stage was his main rival for second place, Republican [[California State Assembly|state assemblyman]] [[Tim Donnelly (politician)|Tim Donnelly]]. Kashkari was seen as a [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscal conservative]] and social moderate, while Donnelly identified with the right-wing [[Tea Party movement]].<ref name=lazo>{{cite news |first=Alejandro |last=Lazo |title=Neel Kashkari, Tim Donnelly make their pitch in California |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/neel-kashkari-tim-donnelly-make-their-pitch-in-california-1401668774 |date=June 1, 2014 |accessdate=June 14, 2014}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

Brown, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], was long considered the favorite to win the general election.
