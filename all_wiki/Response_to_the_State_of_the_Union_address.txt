The '''response to the State of the Union address''' is a rebuttal speech, often brief, delivered by a representative (or representatives) of an opposition party following a presidential [[State of the Union address]]. When the president is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], the rebuttal is typically given by a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and vice versa.

The practice began in 1966 when Republican [[U.S. Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Everett Dirksen]] ([[Illinois]]) and [[U.S. House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Gerald Ford]] ([[Michigan]]) appeared on TV to offer a response to the address by Democratic President [[Lyndon Johnson]].<ref name="senate.gov">{{Cite web|url= https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/RespondStateUnion2.pdf |title= Opposition Responses to the State of the Union Messages |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}</ref> The opposition party's response has varied in format, ranging from a prerecorded 45-minute TV program in 1970<ref name="'70s 47">{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s |last= Frum |first= David |authorlink= David Frum |year= 2000 |publisher= Basic Books |location= New York |isbn= 0-465-04195-7 |page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/47 47] |url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/47 |url-access= registration }}</ref> to a call-in show in 1972 where a panel of congressmen answered unrehearsed questions from callers.<ref name="senate.gov"/> Since the late 1980s, it usually has been a televised speech given soon after the State of the Union address.<ref name="senate.gov"/>

Three people have given both a response and a State of the Union address: Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] and Republicans [[Gerald Ford]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].
