'''Pampanga''' ({{lang-pam|Lalawigan ning Pampanga}}; {{lang-tl|Lalawigan ng Pampanga}}) is a [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] in the [[Central Luzon]] [[Regions of the Philippines|region]] of the [[Philippines]]. Lying on the northern shore of [[Manila Bay]], Pampanga is bordered by [[Tarlac]] to the north, [[Nueva Ecija]] to the northeast, [[Bulacan]] to the east, the [[Manila Bay]] to the central-south, [[Bataan]] to the southwest and [[Zambales]] to the west. Its capital is the [[San Fernando, Pampanga|City of San Fernando]]. [[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles]], while geographically within Pampanga, is classified as a [[Cities of the Philippines#Classification|first-class, highly urbanized city]] and is governed independently of the province.

The name ''La Pampanga'' was given by the Spaniards, who encountered natives living along the banks (''pampáng'') of the [[Pampanga River]]. Its creation in 1571 makes it the first Spanish province on Luzon Island ([[Cebu (province)|Cebu]] in [[Visayas]] is older as it was founded by the Spaniards in 1565). The town of [[Bacolor|Villa de Bacolor]] in the province briefly served as the Spanish colonial capital when [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] [[British occupation of Manila|invaded]] [[Manila]] as part of the [[Seven Years' War]]. At the eve of the [[Philippine Revolution]] of 1896, Pampanga was one of eight provinces placed under [[martial law]] for rebellion against the [[Spanish Empire]]; it is thus represented on the [[Flag of the Philippines|Philippine national flag]] as one of the eight rays of the sun.

Pampanga is served by [[Clark International Airport]] (formerly ''Diosdado Macapagal International Airport''), which is in [[Clark Freeport Zone]], some {{convert|16|km}} north of the provincial capital. The province is home to two [[Philippine Air Force]] [[airbase]]s: [[Basa Air Base]] in [[Floridablanca, Pampanga|Floridablanca]] and the former United States [[Clark Air Base]] in Angeles. Due to its growing population and developments, the Clark Global City is now developed and is located in [[Clark Freeport Zone]]. By 2015, the province has 2,198,110 inhabitants,{{PH census|2015}} while it has 1,079,532 registered voters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/regview.asp?region=03|title=PSA- Active Stats - PSGC Interactive - Region: REGION III (Central Luzon)|accessdate=7 September 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114043809/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/regview.asp?region=03|archive-date=14 November 2012}}</ref>

==History==
{{more citations needed section|date=April 2019}}

Ancient Pampanga's Territorial area included portions of the modern provinces of [[Tarlac]], [[Bataan]], [[Zambales]], [[Nueva Ecija]] and [[Bulacan]]. Pampanga was re-organized as a province by the Spaniards on December 11, 1571. For better administration and taxation purposes, the Spanish authorities subdivided Pampanga into ''pueblos'', which were further subdivided into districts (''[[barangay|barrios]]'') and in some cases into royal and private estates (''[[encomienda]]''s).

Due to excessive abuses committed by some ''encomenderos'', King [[Philip II of Spain]] in 1574 prohibited the further awarding of private estates, but this decree was not fully enforced until 1620. In a report of Philippine encomiendas on June 20, 1591, [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas]] reported to the Crown that La Pampanga's encomiendas were Bataan, Betis y Lubao, Macabebe, Candaba, Apalit, Calumpit, Malolos, Binto, Guiguinto, Caluya, Bulacan and [[Meycauayan|Mecabayan]]. The encomiendas of La Pampanga at that time had eighteen thousand six hundred and eighty whole tributes.

Pampanga, which is about {{convert|850|sqmi|km2}} in area and inhabited by more than 1.5 million people, had its present borders drawn in 1873. During the Spanish regime it was one of the richest Philippine provinces. Manila and its surrounding region were then primarily dependent on Kapampangan agricultural, fishery and forestry products as well as on the supply of skilled workers. As other Luzon provinces were created due to increases in population, some well-established Pampanga towns were lost to new emerging provinces in Central Luzon.

During the 17th century, The [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch]] recruited men from Pampanga as mercenaries who served the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]], known as [[Papanggo|Papangers]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSmqaNFttVkC|title=East of Bali: From Lombok to Timor|first=Kal|last=Müller|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|accessdate=7 September 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9789625931784}}</ref> part of the larger [[Mardijker people|Mardijkers]] community.

The historic province of Bataan which was founded in 1754 under the administration of Spanish [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Pedro Manuel de Arandía Santisteban|Pedro Manuel Arandia]], absorbed from the province of Pampanga the municipalities of Abucay, Balanga (now a city), Dinalupihan, Llana Hermosa, Orani, Orion, Pilar, and Samal.

During the [[British occupation of Manila]] (1762–1764), [[Bacolor]] became the provisional Spanish colonial capital and military base.

The old Pampanga towns of Aliaga, Cabiao, Gapan, San Antonio and San Isidro were ceded to the province of Nueva Ecija in 1848 during the term of Spanish Governor-General [[Narciso Claveria y Zaldua]]. The municipality of ''San Miguel de Mayumo'' of Pampanga was yielded to the province of Bulacan in the same provincial boundary configuration in 1848.

In 1860, the northern towns of Bamban, Capas, Concepcion, Victoria, Tarlac, Mabalacat, Magalang, Porac and Floridablanca were separated from Pampanga and were placed under the jurisdiction of a military command called ''Comandancia Militar de Tarlac''. However, in 1873, the four latter towns were returned to Pampanga and the other five became municipalities of the newly created Province of Tarlac.

On December 8, 1941, Japanese planes bombed [[Clark Air Base]] marking the beginning of the invasion of Pampanga. Between 1941 and 1942, occupying Japanese forces began entering Pampanga.

During the counter-insurgencies under the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1944, Kapampangan guerrilla fighters and the [[Hukbalahap]] Communist guerrillas fought side by side in the province of Pampanga, attacking and retreating the [[Japanese Imperial forces]] for over three years of fighting and invasion.

The establishment of the military general headquarters and military camp bases of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] was active from 1935 to 1946. The [[Philippine Constabulary]] was active from 1935 to 1942 and 1944 to 1946 in the province of Pampanga. During the military engagements of the anti-Japanese Imperial military operations in central Luzon from 1942 to 1945 in the province of Bataan, Bulacan, Northern Tayabas (now Aurora), Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, and Zambales, the local guerrilla resistance fighters and Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas, helped the U.S. military forces fight the Imperial Japanese armed forces.

In the 1945 liberation of Pampanga, Kapampangan guerrilla fighters and the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas supported combat forces from Filipino and American ground troops in attacking Japanese Imperial forces during the Battle of Pampanga until the end of the Second World War. Local military operations soldiers and officers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 2nd, 26th, 3rd, 32nd, 33rd, 35th, 36th and 37th Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary 3rd Constabulary Regiment recaptured and liberated the province of Pampanga and fought against the Japanese Imperial forces during the Battle of Pampanga.

After the Second World War, operations in the main province of Pampanga was downfall insurgencies and conflicts between the Philippine Government forces and the Hukbalahap Communist rebels on 1946 to 1954 during the [[Hukbalahap Rebellion]].

During the [[Human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship|Marcos dictatorship]], thousands of Kapampangans were [[torture]]d and [[murder]]ed through various means such as [[List of torture methods used by the Marcos dictatorship|rape, forced stripping, electric shocks, beatings, and genital mutilations, among many others]].

The June 15, 1991 eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] displaced a large number of people with the submersion of whole towns and villages by massive [[lahar]] floods. This led to a large-scale advancement in disaster preparation in government. In 2010, a Kapampangan, [[Benigno Aquino III]], son of former president [[Corazon Aquino]], was elected as president.

On April 22, 2019, the province suffered severe damage due to [[2019 Luzon earthquake|6.1 magnitude earthquake]] which originated from [[Zambales]] and was the most affected area by the earthquake due to province sitting on soft sediment and [[alluvial]] soil.<ref name=quake005>{{cite news |title=Why was Pampanga worse hit by quake than Zambales epicenter?|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/04/23/19/why-was-pampanga-worse-hit-by-quake-than-zambales-epicenter |accessdate=April 23, 2019 |work=ABS-CBN News}}</ref> Several structures in the province were damaged by the quake, including a 4-story supermarket in Porac, the [[Bataan]]-Pampanga boundary arch and the main terminal of [[Clark International Airport]], as well as old churches in [[Lubao, Pampanga|Lubao]] and [[Porac, Pampanga|Porac]], where the stone bell tower of the 19th-century [[Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church (Porac)|Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church]] collapsed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/04/22/19/look-quake-damages-church-other-structures-in-pampanga|title=LOOK: Quake damages church, other structures in Pampanga|publisher=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=22 April 2019}}</ref>

Other industries include its casket industry and the manufacturing of all-purpose vehicles in the municipality of Santo Tomas.

The province is famous for its sophisticated culinary work. Kapampangans are well known for their culinary creations. Famous food products range from the mundane to the exotic. Roel's Meat Products, Pampanga's Best and Mekeni Food are among the better known meat brands of the country producing Kapampangan favorites such as pork and chicken [[tocino]]s, [[beef tapa]], hotdogs, [[Longaniza#Philippines|longganiza]]s (Philippine-style cured sausages) and [[chorizo]]s.

Specialty foods such as the [[siopao]], [[pandesal]], tutong, [[lechon]] (roasted pig) and its sarsa (sauce) are popular specialty foods in the region. The more exotic ''betute tugak'' (stuffed frog), ''kamaru'' (mole crickets) cooked adobo, ''bulanglang'' (pork cooked in guava juice), ''[[lechon kawali]]'' and ''[[bringhe]]'' (a green sticky rice dish like paella) are a mainstay in Kapampangan feasts.

Native sweets and delicacies like pastillas, turonnes de casuy, buro, are the most sought after by Filipinos including a growing number of tourists who enjoy authentic Kapampangan cuisine.

==Boat culture==
There have been proposals to revitalize the [[karakoa]] shipbuilding tradition of the Kapampangan people in recent years. The karakoa was the warship of the Kapampangan from the classical eras (before 15th century) up to the 16th century. The production of the karakoa and its usage were stopped by the Spanish colonialists to establish the galleon ship-making tradition instead, as a sign of Spanish dominance over the Kapampangan.

==Government and politics==
Like other provinces in the Philippines, Pampanga is governed by a governor and vice governor who are elected to three-year terms. The governor is the executive head and leads the province's departments in executing the ordinances and improving public services. The vice governor heads a legislative council (Sangguniang Panlalawigan) consisting of board members from the districts.

===Provincial government===
{{wide image|PampangaProvincialCapitoljf876.JPG|1000px|{{center|Pampanga Provincial Capitol}}}}
Just as the national government, the provincial government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative and judiciary. The judicial branch is administered solely by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]. The LGUs have control of the executive and legislative branch.

The executive branch is composed of the governor for the province, mayors for the cities and municipalities, and the barangay captains for the barangays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dilg.gov.ph/pdf/LGC%20Book%203.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326164110/http://www.dilg.gov.ph/pdf/LGC%20Book%203.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-26 }}</ref> The provincial assembly for the provinces, Sangguniang Panlungsod (city assembly) for the cities, Sangguniang Bayan (town assembly) for the municipalities, Sangguniang Barangay (barangay council), and the [[Sangguniang Kabataan]] for the youth sector.

The seat of government is vested upon the governor and other elected officers who hold office at the Provincial Capitol building. The Sanguniang Panlalawigan is the center of legislation.

===Court system===
The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] recognizes Pampanga regional trial courts and metropolitan or municipal trial courts within the province and towns, that have an overall jurisdiction in the populace of the province and towns, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno8369.htm|title=PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES - CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|first=Joselito Guianan Chan, Managing Partner, Chan Robles and Associates Law|last=Firm|accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref>
