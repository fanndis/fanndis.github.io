The '''Royal Standards of Canada''' are a set of uniquely Canadian personal [[flag]]s approved by the [[Elizabeth II of Canada|Queen of Canada]] for use by members of the [[Monarchy of Canada#Canada's royal family and house|Canadian Royal Family]]. They are used to denote the presence of the bearer within any car, ship, airplane, building, or area, within Canada or when representing Canada abroad. There are six personal [[royal standard]]s, one each for the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]], the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]], the [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]], the [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Duke of York]], and the [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Earl of Wessex]], as well as one standard for use more generally to denote the presence of any member of the Royal Family who has not previously been provided with a specific personal standard. The flags are part of a larger collection of [[Canadian royal symbols]].<ref>{{Cite book| last=Franco| first=Guida| title=Canadian Almanac & Directory 2006| publisher=Micromedia ProQuest| year=2006| location=Toronto| page=3| isbn=978-1-895021-90-5}}</ref>

==Other members of the Royal Family==
There are currently five variants of the sovereign's royal standard, each approved by the Queen of Canada by [[letters patent]] for a specific member of [[Monarchy of Canada#Royal family and house|Canada's royal family]]: [[Prince Charles, Prince of Wales]]; [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]]; [[Princess Anne, Princess Royal]]; [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]]; and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]]. The sixth variant is used by any other member of the Canadian Royal Family who has not been presented by the Crown with a personal Canadian standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=2655|title=Members of the Royal Family [Royal Family]|first=The Office of the Secretary to the Governor|last=General|website=reg.gg.ca}}</ref>  All were created by the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]], the first two, other than the sovereign's, being the banners for the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge.

The [[Ermine_(heraldry)|ermine bordered]] Royal Standard was registered 15 January, 2015 for use by members of the Royal Family who do not have a personal standard for use in Canada.

All variants are in a 1:2 proportion. The Personal Standards consist of the escutcheon of the Royal Arms of Canada defaced with both a blue roundel surrounded by a wreath and a white [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points. The wreath on Prince Charles' banner is of gold maple leaves, the roundel depicts the [[Prince of Wales' feathers]], and the label is not charged, signifying the eldest son of the monarch. Prince William's flag has a wreath of gold maple leaves and [[scallop]] shells, the roundel bears a depiction of his [[Royal cypher|cypher]] (a ''W'' surmounted by a [[coronet]] of his rank), and the label is charged with a red shell, reminiscent of the [[Diana, Princess of Wales#Arms|coat of arms of his mother]], [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. The remainder of the banners have wreaths of gold maple leaves only. On the royal standard of the Princess Royal, the roundel bears Anne's cypher (an ''A'' surmounted by a coronet of her rank, a child of the monarch) and the label is charged with a red heart at centre and the other two with red crosses, taken from the Princess' coat of arms.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.facebook.com/#!/HeraldryHeraldique/posts/670267386325929| last=Canadian Heraldic Authority| title=The flag of The Princess Royal for use in Canada| accessdate=22 October 2013}}</ref> The roundel on the royal standard of the Duke of York bears Andrew's cypher (an ''A'' surmounted by a coronet of his rank, a child of the monarch) and the centre label is charged with a blue anchor, taken from the Prince's coat of arms. The Earl of Wessex's standard uses the cypher of Edward (an ''E'' surmounted by a coronet of his rank, a child of the monarch) on the roundel and has within the centre label a [[Tudor Rose]].

==Use and protocol==
[[File:EIIR-flag-parl.jpg|thumb|left|The Queen's standard flying from the [[Peace Tower]] on [[Parliament Hill]]]]

Prior to the adoption of the Canadian royal standards, [[Royal tours of Canada|members of the Royal Family who toured Canada]] used the royal standard they employed when in the United Kingdom; after 1931, each of those standards took on a dual role of representing a member of either the British or the Canadian Royal Family, depending on the context. Only during a 2009 tour by Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, did the Prince of Wales use the British standard for members of the Royal Family who are not entitled to a personal standard of their own, rather than the standard used by the Prince of Wales for England and Wales.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Queen's personal Canadian flag is employed only when the Queen is in [[Canada]] or is attending an event abroad as the Canadian [[head of state]]; for example, the flag was unfurled at [[Juno Beach]] in [[France]] when the Queen was present there for commemorations of the [[Normandy Landings]]. The flag must be broken immediately upon the sovereign's arrival and lowered directly after her departure from any building, ship, aircraft, or other space or vehicle.<ref name=DCH>{{cite web| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/o7-eng.cfm| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Ceremonial and Canadian Symbols Promotion > Personal flags and standards| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=25 November 2009| date=2013-12-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release| url=http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=1&pageId=26&id=4178| author=Office of the Prime Minister of Canada| title=PM unveils a new personal flag for use in Canada for His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge| date=29 June 2011| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> On land, as per [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] protocol, the Queen's standard must be flown from a [[flagpole]] bearing as a [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] head the crest of the Canadian royal arms.<ref>{{Citation| last=Department of National Defence| author-link=Department of National Defence (Canada)| title=The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces| page=4–1–6| place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| date=1 April 1999| url=http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf| id=A-AD-200-000/AG-000| accessdate=8 February 2012}}</ref> As the monarch is the [[Monarchy of Canada#Personification of the state|personification of the Canadian state]], her banner also takes precedence above all other flags in Canada, including the [[Flag of Canada|national flag]] and those of the other members of the [[Monarchy of Canada#Royal family and house|Canadian Royal Family]], and is never flown at [[Half-staff#Canada|half-mast]] when the sovereign dies, since there is [[The king is dead, long live the king!|always a sovereign on the Canadian throne]].<ref name=DCH/>

No other person may use the flag; the Queen's federal representative, the [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]], possesses a [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada|unique personal flag]], as does [[Flags of the Lieutenant-Governors of Canada|each of the monarch's provincial viceroys]]. Flags are kept at the Queen's Ottawa residence, [[Rideau Hall]], and supplied to [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] royal visit staff by the household staff prior to the Queen's arrival.<ref name=DCH/>

Protocol is sometimes, though rarely, officially broken. On 9 August 1902, the day of the coronation of King [[Edward VII]], the monarch's royal standard (then the same in Canada as in the United Kingdom) was raised on a temporary flag pole at His Majesty's Dockyard in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]. Similarly, for the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] on 2 June 1953, the sovereign's royal standard was broken atop the [[Peace Tower]] on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://gov.ns.ca/iga/qpflag.asp| last=Government of Nova Scotia| title=The Queen's Personal Canadian Flag| publisher=Queen's Printer for Nova Scotia| accessdate=29 February 2012}}</ref> Sixty years later, on 6 February 2012, the Queen's personal standard for Canada was unfurled at Rideau Hall and Parliament Hill, as well as at other [[Legislative Assemblies of Canadian provinces and territories|legislatures across the country]] to mark [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II#Canada|the monarch's diamond anniversary of her accession to the throne]];<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.chrisd.ca/blog/50254/manitoba-queen-elizabeth-ii-diamond-jubilee-celebrations/| title=Manitoba Celebrating Queen's Diamond Jubilee| date=6 February 2012| publisher=ChrisD| accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref> permission to do so was granted by the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edmonton.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20120206/diamond-jubilee-celebrations-120206/20120206/?hub=EdmontonHome |title=Canada kicks off festivities for Queen's jubilee |date=6 February 2012 |publisher=CTV |accessdate=6 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318190237/http://edmonton.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20120206/diamond-jubilee-celebrations-120206/20120206/?hub=EdmontonHome |archivedate=March 18, 2012 }}</ref>

==Coronation standard==

[[File:Coronation Standard of Canada.svg|thumb|right|Coronation Standard used in 1937 and 1953]]

During the coronation ceremony of the monarch at Westminster Abbey, the "standards" of various countries are carried by various officials in the procession inside the abbey. These flags are the country's coat of arms as a [[banner of arms]]. For Canada, similar standards based on the previous coat of arms were used thrice: at the coronations of [[Coronation of George V and Mary|King George V]], [[Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth|King George VI]] and [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1911, 1937, and 1953, respectively.{{fact|date=August 2015}} The banner of the coat of arms of the first four Canadian provinces was used in 1911<ref>{{Cite news|date=1911-05-15|title=CORONATION STANDARDS.|pages=5|work=Northern Star (Lismore, NSW : 1876 - 1954)|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article72278988|access-date=2020-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Alfred Pearse (c.1854-1933) - Coronation of George V: Standard bearers|url=https://www.rct.uk/collection/923166/coronation-of-george-v-standard-bearers|access-date=2020-08-18|website=www.rct.uk|language=en}}</ref>, with the banner of the 1921-1957 version of the arms used in 1937 and 1953<ref>{{Cite news|date=1953-05-23|title=Australian Standard For Coronation|pages=2|work=Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1931 - 1954)|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48278293|access-date=2020-08-18}}</ref>.
