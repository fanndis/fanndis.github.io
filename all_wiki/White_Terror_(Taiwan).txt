In [[Taiwan]], the '''White Terror''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|白色恐怖}}|p=báisè kǒngbù}}) was the suppression of political dissidents following the [[February 28 Incident]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Rubinstein  |first =  Murray A. |year = 2007 |title = Taiwan: A New History |publisher = M.

}}</ref> Taiwan's period of martial law had been the longest period of martial law in the world at the time it was lifted, but has since been surpassed by the [[Syria]]n 48-year period of martial law, which lasted from 1963 to 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Barker|first1=Anne|title=Syria to end 48 years of martial law|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-03-28/syria-to-end-48-years-of-martial-law/2639462|accessdate=30 September 2014|work=ABC/Wire|publisher=ABC News|date=28 March 2011}}</ref>

==Time period==
The term "White Terror" in its broadest meaning refers to the entire period from 1947 to 1987.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Disciplining Taiwan: The Kuomintang's Methods of Control during the White Terror Era (1947-1987) | first=Ketty |last= Chen| journal=Taiwan International Studies Quarterly |date=Winter 2008  | volume=4 | issue=4 | page=187|url= http://www.tisanet.org/quarterly/4-4-8.pdf}}</ref> Around 140,000 Taiwanese were imprisoned during this period, of whom from about 3,000 to 4,000 were executed for their real or perceived opposition to the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party) government led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]].<ref name=TaipeiTimes20050520 /> Most actual prosecutions, though, took place in 1950–1953. Most of those prosecuted were labeled by the Kuomintang as "{{ill|bandit spies|zh|匪諜}}", meaning spies for Chinese communists, and punished as such.
  
The KMT mostly imprisoned Taiwan's intellectual and social elite out of fear that they might resist KMT rule or sympathize with communism.<ref name=TaipeiTimes20050520/> For example, the [[Formosan League for Reemancipation]] was a [[Taiwanese independence]] group established in 1947 which the KMT believed to be under communist control, leading to its members being arrested in 1950. The [[World United Formosans for Independence]] was persecuted for similar reasons. However, other prosecutions did not have such clear reasoning; in 1968 [[Bo Yang]] was imprisoned for his choice of words in translating a [[Popeye]] comic strip. A large number of the White Terror's other victims were mainland Chinese, many of whom owed their evacuation to Taiwan to the KMT.{{Verify source|date=July 2019}} Often, after having come unaccompanied to Taiwan, these refugees to Taiwan were considered more disposable than local Taiwanese. Many of the mainland Chinese who survived the White Terror in Taiwan, like [[Bo Yang]] and [[Li Ao]], moved on to promote Taiwan's democratization and the reform of the Kuomintang. In 1969, future president [[Lee Teng-hui]] was detained and interrogated for more than a week by the [[Taiwan Garrison Command]], which demanded to know about his "communist activities" and told him "killing you at this moment is as easy as crushing an ant to death." Three years later he was invited to join the cabinet of [[Chiang Ching-kuo]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Tsai |first = Shih-shan Henry |year = 2005 |title = Lee Teng-Hui and Taiwan's Quest for Identity |url = https://archive.org/details/leetenghuitaiwan00tsai |url-access = limited |publisher = Palgrave Macmillan| location = New York|isbn = 9781403970565|pages=[https://archive.org/details/leetenghuitaiwan00tsai/page/n119 101]–103}}</ref>

Fear of discussing the White Terror and the February 28 Incident gradually decreased with the lifting of martial law after the [[1987 Lieyu Massacre]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Hau Pei-tsun|title=<8-year Diary of the Chief of the General Staff (1981-1989)>|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2WKCAAAAIAAJ|publisher=Commonwealth Publishing |date= 2000-01-01|ISBN=9576216389}}{{in lang|zh-tw}}</ref> culminating in the establishment of an official public memorial and an apology by [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Lee Teng-hui]] in 1995. In 2008, President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] addressed a memorial service for the White Terror in Taipei. Ma apologized to the victims and their family members on behalf of the government, and expressed the hope that Taiwan would never again experience a similar tragedy.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/2008/07/16/165677/President-Ma.htm |title=President Ma attends White Terror Memorial |newspaper=China Post |date=July 16, 2008 }}</ref>

==Legacy==
Since the lifting of martial law in 1987, the government has set up the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation, a civilian reparations fund supported by public donations for the victims and their families. Many descendants of victims remain unaware that their family members were victims, while many of the families of victims from Mainland China did not know the details of their relatives' mistreatment during the riot.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} 

===Film===

* [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]]'s ''[[A City of Sadness]]'', the first movie dealing with the [[February 28 incident]], won the [[Golden Lion]] at the 1989 [[Venice Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096908/awards|title=A City of Sadness|date=21 October 1989|accessdate=12 March 2017|via=IMDb}}</ref>
* The 2009 thriller ''[[Formosa Betrayed (film)|Formosa Betrayed]]'' also relates the incident as part of the motivation behind [[Taiwan independence]] activist characters.
* The 2019 horror film [[Detention (2019 film)|Detention]], an adaptation of the eponymous video game, deals with a group of students and teachers who are arrested for political reasons during White Terror.

===Literature===
[[Taiwanese-American]] [[Julie Wu]]'s novel ''The Third Son'' describes the event and its aftermath from the viewpoint of a Taiwanese boy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Winterton |first=Bradley |title=Book review: The Third Son |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2013/05/07/2003561643 |accessdate={{date|2014-11-14|mdy}} |newspaper=Taipei Times |date={{date|2014-05-07|mdy}} }}</ref>

In her 2013 novel, ''The 228 Legacy'', author Jennifer J. Chow brings to light the emotional ramifications for those who lived through the events yet suppressed their knowledge out of fear. It focuses on how there was such an impact that it permeated throughout multiple generations within the same family.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bloom |first=Dan |title=US author probes 'legacy' of the 228 Incident in novel |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/08/19/2003570059 |accessdate=7 May 2014 |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=Aug 19, 2013 }}</ref>

[[Shawna Yang Ryan]]'s novel ''Green Island''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/246332/green-island/|title=Green Island by Shawna Yang Ryan - PenguinRandomHouse.com|accessdate=12 March 2017}}</ref> tells the story of the incident as it affects three generations of a Taiwanese family.

[[Ken Liu]]'s ''The Paper Menagerie & Other Short Stories'' includes a short story titled ''The Literomancer'' which references the 228 incident from the perspective of a young American girl who had recently moved to Taiwan, and asks both her father, who works on an American military base, and a neighbor, and old man named Mr. Kan about the incident. It develops on these two different perspectives throughout the story, becoming progressively darker.

===Games===
In 2017, Taiwanese game developer [[Red Candle Games]] launched ''[[Detention (video game)|Detention]]'', a survival horror video game created and developed for [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. It is a 2D atmospheric horror side-scroller set in 1960s Taiwan under martial law following the [[February 28 incident|228 incident]]. The critically acclaimed game also incorporates religious elements based on Taiwanese culture and mythology. Rely On Horror gave the game a 9 out of 10, saying that "every facet of Detention moves in one harmonious lockstep towards an unavoidable tragedy, drowning out the world around you."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.relyonhorror.com/reviews/detentionreview/|title=Review: Detention - Rely on Horror|accessdate=12 March 2017}}</ref>
