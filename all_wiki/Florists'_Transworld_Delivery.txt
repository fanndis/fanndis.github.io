'''FTD LLC'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ftdcompanies.com/content.asp?tid=91|title=FTD Companies {{!}} Press Release - October 1, 2019|website=ftdcompanies.com|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref> (FTD), also known as '''Florists' Transworld Delivery''', is a [[Floral Wire Service|floral wire service]], [[retailer]] and [[wholesaler]] based in [[Downers Grove, Illinois|Downers Grove]], [[Illinois]], in the [[United States]]. 
FTD was founded as '''Florists' Telegraph Delivery''' in 1910, to help customers send flowers remotely on the same day by using [[florist]]s in the FTD network who are near the intended recipient. It was based in Detroit, Michigan and then moved to Southfield, Michigan prior to its move to Downers Grove.
It originated as a [[retailers' cooperative]] and began a process of [[demutualization]] in 1994.
It operates two main businesses: The Consumer Business sells flowers and gift items through its websites and The Floral Business sells computer services, software and even fresh [[cut flowers]] to FTD and [[Interflora]] affiliated florists.

'''Retail Florist Association''' (formerly '''Extra Touch Florist Association''' and '''FTD Association''') is a [[trade association]] that originated as the member education, advocacy and quality assurance arm of FTD, breaking formal ties with FTD in 2001.

FTD processes orders through the Mercury Network, its international telecommunications service.

==History==

On August 18, 1910, thirteen [[Americans|American]] florists led by John Valentine, a Denver lawyer and floral company owner{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} agreed to serve each other's out-of-town customers by exchanging orders via [[Telegraphy|telegraph]]. This group was called Florists' Telegraph Delivery. In 1914, the company adapted [[Mercury (mythology)|''Mercury'']] by sixteenth century Flemish sculptor [[Giambologna]] for its ''Mercury Man'' corporate logo, to emphasize the speed of delivery. In 1965, it began offering international order, and took the name of Florists' Transworld Delivery.<ref>{{Cite web

===Going public===

In 1994, FTD began a process of [[demutualization]], acquiring control of the business, and ownership of its assets.
On December 19, 1994, a precursor to the FTD Corporation, a private, for-profit company  [[Richard C. Perry|Perry Capital]], acquired FTD, which then divided FTD into two organizations: FTD Incorporated, a for profit corporation, and FTD Association, a non-profit [[trade association]].

FTD Incorporated retained FTD's businesses, including the Mercury Network and the clearinghouse, and controlled FTD Association's rules, regulations, and bylaws.  The FTD Association retained member education, advocacy and quality assurance.

In 2000, FTD Incorporated held an [[initial public offering]] of FTD.com on the [[NASDAQ]].  FTD Group was listed on the NYSE in 2005. The company is based in [[Downers Grove, Illinois|Downers Grove]], [[Illinois]].

In 2001, the FTD Association separated from FTD Incorporated, terminated all contracts, and, in exchange for $14&nbsp;million, renamed itself Extra Touch Floral Association, and later, Retail Florist Association.  It is based in [[Livonia, Michigan]].<ref>{{Cite web

It has been sued several times by the [[United States Department of Justice]] to ensure it does not engage in non-competitive behavior, namely prohibiting members from affiliating with competing flowers-by-wire services. FTD entered into consent decrees with the Department of Justice after 1956, 1969, and 1990 suits.<ref>{{Cite web

Florists' Transworld Delivery (FTD), sued its competitor [[ProFlowers]] for false advertising in August 2005. The suit focused on ProFlowers' claim to ship "direct from the fields" with "no middlemen". Stating that the lawsuit was "without merit", ProFlowers brought counterclaims against FTD. The lawsuit was settled a year later out of court.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}
