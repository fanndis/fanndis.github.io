During her [[The Fame Ball Tour|Fame Ball Tour]] performance at [[Palm Springs, California]], on April 11, 2009, Gaga explained to the crowd the true meaning behind the term "Poker Face" used in the song. She suggested that the song dealt with her personal experience with [[bisexuality]].

The video premiered on October 22, 2008. It is set by a pool, as well as in a mansion. It begins with Gaga emerging from the pool wearing a mirror masquerade mask and a black sleeveless latex bodysuit with a jagged shoulder pad, with two [[Great Dane]]s beside her. She throws the mask aside and the song begins with a facial shot of Gaga singing it.<ref name=video/> Gaga wears a metallic sticker on her left cheek in this shot. Featured in the video are scenes of Gaga in a mansion and dancing poolside with her dancers in a turquoise leotard.<ref name=video/> Gaga attends a wild party where every man and woman tries their luck on a [[strip poker]] game. The party gets wilder when all the party's guests strip down to their underwear, dance around, and share kisses with each other. The video also features several white mannequins on her swimming pool deck. During the musical interlude before the "I won't tell you that I love you" hook, Gaga is shown in her trademark "Pop Music Will Never Be Low Brow" sunglasses while sitting beside the pool. The video ends with the head shot of Gaga singing the Mum-mum-mum-ma hook.

Gaga explained in the nineteenth episode of her "Transmission Gagavision" series the main idea behind the music video for "Poker Face": "I knew I wanted it to be sexy, so I thought no pants, because that's sexy, [...]And I knew I wanted it to be futuristic, so I thought shoulder pads, because that's my thing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interscope.com/artist/player/default.aspx?mid=4556&aid=599|title=Transmission Gagavision: Episode 19|date=December 13, 2008|work=[[Interscope Records]]|accessdate=April 17, 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925112418/http://www.interscope.com/artist/player/default.aspx?mid=4556&aid=599|archivedate=September 25, 2012}}</ref> The music video premiered on [[MTV (UK and Ireland)|British MTV]] on February 17, 2009.

The performance started with Gaga sitting at a Plexiglass piano filled with bubbles and bathed in pink light. She started singing the second verse of "Poker Face" in a [[Bette Midler]] style accompanied by a violin player while wearing a shiny aluminum shoulder pad and platinum bleached blond wig. After the first chorus, the pace increased whence the original intro for the song started. Gaga got up from her seat and proceeded to perform the song in the middle of the stage. She wore a silvery leotard with a giant star on her shoulder and tassels. As the song progressed to the intermediate verse, the violinist played a hoe-down version of the music and Gaga danced around frantically over the stage. The performance ended with Gaga staring towards the audience while revealing an open zipper, patched over her left eye. The performance was described an "alien-disco performance art."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1608347/20090402/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Shows Her Flashiest 'Poker Face' On 'American Idol'|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|date=April 2, 2009|accessdate=April 6, 2009|publisher=[[MTV]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405061051/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1608347/20090402/lady_gaga.jhtml|archivedate=April 5, 2009}}</ref> Cortney Harding of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote, "[it was] Gaga's crowning TV moment ... show[ing] middle America that she was a bona fide pop star."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267810/lady-gaga-the-billboard-cover-story|title=Lady Gaga: The Billboard Cover Story|date=August 7, 2009|accessdate=September 7, 2009|last=Harding|first=Cortney|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309235202/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267810/lady-gaga-the-billboard-cover-story|archivedate=March 9, 2013}}</ref>
