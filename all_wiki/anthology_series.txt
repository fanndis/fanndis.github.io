An '''anthology series''' is a [[radio programming|radio]], [[television program|television]], or [[film series]] that presents a different story and a different set of characters in each [[episode]], [[Season (television)#Seasons.2Fseries|season]], segment or [[short film|short]].<ref>{{cite journal |date=23 October 2015|title=Anthology series changing television|journal=UWIRE Text|pages=1 |via=General OneFile}}</ref> These usually have a different cast in each episode, but several series in the past, such as ''[[Four Star Playhouse]]'', employed a permanent troupe of character actors who would appear in a different drama each week.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044263/fullcredits |title=Full Cast & Crew |website=IMDb |access-date=19 April 2019}}</ref> Some anthology series, such as ''[[Westinghouse Studio One|Studio One]]'', began on radio and then expanded to television.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.rodserling.com/PPBintro.htm |title=Patterns |last=Sterling |first=Rob |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |year=2015 |isbn=978-1505707465 |chapter=About Writing for Television}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The word comes from [[Ancient Greek]] ἀνθολογία (''anthología'', “flower-gathering”), from ἀνθολογέω (''anthologéō'', "I gather flowers"), from ἄνθος (''ánthos'', "flower") + λέγω (''légō'', "I gather, pick up, collect"), coined by [[Meleager of Gadara]] circa 60 BCE, originally as Στέφανος (στέφανος (''stéphanos'', "garland")) to describe a collection of poetry, later retitled anthology – see [[Greek Anthology]]. ''Anthologiai'' were collections of small Greek poems and epigrams, because in Greek culture the flower symbolized the finer sentiments that only poetry can express.

==Radio==
Many popular [[old-time radio]] programs were anthology series. On some series, such as ''[[Inner Sanctum Mysteries]]'', the only constant was the host, who introduced and concluded each dramatic presentation. One of the earliest such programs was ''[[The Collier Hour]]'', broadcast on the [[NBC]] [[Blue Network]] from 1927 to 1932.<ref name=":1">{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2e0RDAAAQBAJ&q=%22The+Collier+Hour,+the+first%22&pg=PA163 |last=Dunning |first=John |author-link=John Dunning (detective fiction author) |title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-19-507678-3 |pages=163–164 |edition=Revised |access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> As radio's first major dramatic anthology, it adapted stories and serials from ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' in a calculated move to increase subscriptions and compete with ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Airing on the Wednesday prior to each week's distribution of the magazine, the program soon moved to Sundays in order to avoid spoilers with dramatizations of stories simultaneously appearing in the magazine.<ref name=":1" />

==Television==
In the history of television, live anthology dramas were especially popular during the [[Golden Age of Television]] of the 1950s with series such as ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'' and ''[[The Philco Television Playhouse]].''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kraszewski|first=Jon|date=Fall 2006|title=Adapting Scripts in the 1950s: The Economic and Political Incentives for Television Anthology Writers|journal=Journal of Film and Video|volume=58|issue=3|pages=3–21|jstor=20688526}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Ron|date=2013|editor-last=Riggs|editor-first=Thomas|title=Philco Television Playhouse|journal=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture|edition=2nd|publisher=St. James Press|volume=4|pages=144–145}}</ref>

[[Dick Powell]] came up with an idea for an anthology series, ''[[Four Star Playhouse]]'', with a rotation of established stars every week, four stars in all. The stars would own the studio and the program, as [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Desi Arnaz]] had done successfully with [[Desilu]] studio. Powell had intended for the program to feature himself, [[Charles Boyer]], [[Joel McCrea]], and [[Rosalind Russell]]. When Russell and McCrea backed out, [[David Niven]] came on board as the third star. The fourth star was initially a guest star. [[CBS]] liked the idea, and ''Four Star Playhouse'' made its debut in fall of 1952.<ref name=":0" /> It ran on alternate weeks only during the first season, alternating with ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]''. It was successful enough to be renewed and became a weekly program from the second season until the end of its run in 1956. [[Ida Lupino]] was brought on board as the de facto fourth star, though unlike Powell, Boyer, and Niven, she owned no stock in the company.

American [[television network]]s would sometimes run summer anthology series which consisted of unsold [[television pilot]]s.<ref>[http://home.wlv.ac.uk/~in5379/film.htm#starlight Ray Bradbury on Film and TV: ''Starlight Summer Theater'' (1954)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006074209/http://home.wlv.ac.uk/~in5379/film.htm#starlight |date=October 6, 2008 }}</ref> Beginning in 1971, the long-run ''[[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece Theatre]]'' drama anthology series brought British productions to American television.

In 2011, ''[[American Horror Story]]'' debuted a new type of anthology format in the U.S. Each season, rather than each episode, is a standalone story. Several actors have appeared in the various seasons, but playing different roles—in an echo of the ''Four Star Playhouse'' format.<ref>{{Citation|title=American Horror Story|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1844624/|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref>

The success of ''American Horror Story'' has spawned other season-long anthologies such as ''[[American Crime Story]]'' and ''[[Feud (TV series)|Feud]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Malone|first=Michael|date=2 May 2016|title=Anthology format gets a 'true' rebirth: AMC is the latest of many nets modeling shows after True Detective and Fargo.|journal=Broadcasting & Cable|volume=146|issue=17|pages=24|via=Academic OneFile}}</ref>

== Film ==
Anthology film series are rare compared to their TV and radio counterparts. There have been several attempts within the horror genre to have a franchise with an anthology format, such as with the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' franchise]] where the third film, ''[[Halloween: Season of the Witch]]'', was meant to be the beginning of a series of anthology horror films, but due to negative reception that plan was shelved.
