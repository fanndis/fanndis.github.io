'''Luzon''' ({{IPA-tl|luˈzon}} or {{IPA-tl|luˈson|}}) is the largest and most populous [[List of islands in the Philippines|island]] in the [[Philippines]]. It is ranked [[List of islands by area|15th largest]] in the world by [[land area]]. Located in the northern portion of the [[archipelago]], it is the economic and political center of the nation, being home to the country's capital city, [[Manila]], as well as [[Quezon City]], the country's most populous city. With a population of 53 million {{As of|2015|lc=y}},{{PH census|2015|d}} it contains 52.5% of the country's total population and is the [[List of islands by population|fourth most populous island]] in the world.<ref name="ThePHArchipelago">{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90C4DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA16| page=16| title=The Philippine Archipelago|first=Yves |last=Boquet |publisher=Springer|year= 2017|isbn= 9783319519265}}</ref>

Luzon may also refer to one of the three primary [[Island groups of the Philippines|island groups in the country]]. As such, it includes the Luzon [[mainland]], the [[Batanes]] and [[Babuyan Islands|Babuyan]] groups of islands to the north, [[Polillo Islands]] to the east, and the outlying islands of [[Catanduanes]], [[Marinduque]] and [[Mindoro]], among others, to the south.<ref name="unique">{{cite book | last=Zaide | first=Sonia M. | title=The Philippines, a Unique Nation | page=50 }}</ref> The islands of [[Masbate]], [[Palawan (island)|Palawan]] and [[Romblon]] are also included, although these three are sometimes grouped with the [[Visayas]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Bangkajf.JPG|thumb|left|upright|''Bangkang pinawa'', an ancient Philippine [[mortar and pestle]].]]
The name ''Luzon'' is thought to derive from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word ''lusong'', a large wooden [[mortar and pestle|mortar]] used in dehusking rice.<ref>{{cite book|author=Keat Gin Ooi|title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&pg=PA798|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-770-2|page=798}}</ref><ref name=Roberts1>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|page=59|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/59/}}</ref> A 2008 PIDS research paper by Eulito Bautista and Evelyn Javier provides an image of a lusong, explaining:

{{bquote|Traditional milling was accomplished in the 1900s by pounding the palay with a wooden pestle in a stone or wooden mortar called lusong. The first pounding takes off the hull and further pounding removes the bran but also breaks most grains. Further winnowing with a bamboo tray (bilao) separates the hull from the rice grains. This traditional hand-pounding chore, although very laborious and resulted in a lot of broken rice, required two to three skilled men and women to work harmoniously and was actually a form of socializing among young folks in the villages.<ref name="EulitoandJavier2008">{{Cite journal|last1=Bautista|first1=Eulito U.|last2=Javier|first2=Evelyn F.|date=2008|title=Rice Production Practices: PIDS Research Paper Series 2008-02|url=http://dirp4.pids.gov.ph/ris/rps/pidsrp0802.pdf|journal=Philippine Institute of Development Studies Research Papers Series|publisher=Philippine Institute of Development Studies|pages=44}}</ref>}}

==History==
{{Further|History of Luzon|Tondo (historical polity)|Namayan|Rajahnate of Maynila}}

Luzon was originally inhabited by [[Negrito]]s before [[Austronesians]] from Taiwan scattered and displaced them. The Austronesian groups were divided into two types of nations; coastal lowland states or highland civilizations. Highland civilizations were based in the mountains and had built up plutocracies based on agriculture, such as the [[Igorot Society]] which is responsible for building many of the [[Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras|rice terraces]] in the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Mountains]], among the most notable being the [[Banaue Rice Terraces]]. Meanwhile, coastal states were split among [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] kingdoms, [[Muslim]] principalities, and [[Philippine mythology|ethnoreligious]] tribes, who had trading connections with [[Borneo]], [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], [[Indochina]], [[Bengal]], [[India]], [[Korea]], [[Ryukyu Islands|Okinawa]], [[Japan]] and [[China]], before the Spaniards established their rule. From just before the first millennium, the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] and [[Pangasinan people|Pangasinan]] peoples of south and central Luzon had established several major coastal [[polity|polities]], most notable among them those of [[Rajahnate of Maynila|Maynila]], [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] and [[Namayan]]. The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]], the first Philippine document written in 900AD, names places in and around [[Manila Bay]] as well as [[Medan]] in Indonesia.<ref>[http://www.mts.net/~pmorrow/lcieng.htm Laguna Copperplate Inscription – Article in English] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205031106/http://www.mts.net/~pmorrow/lcieng.htm |date=2008-02-05 }}.

Retrieved on 2010-12-19.</ref> These kingdoms were based on leases between village rulers (''[[Datu]]'') and landlords (''[[Lakan]]'') or [[Rajah]]s, to whom tributes and taxes were levied. These kingdoms were coastal [[Thalassocracy|thalassocracies]] based on trade with neighboring Asian political entities at that time.

There was also a Buddhist polity known as [[Ma-i]] or Maidh, described in Chinese and Bruneian records in the 10th century AD, although its location is still unknown and scholars are divided on whether it is in modern-day [[Bay, Laguna]] or [[Bulalacao]], [[Mindoro]].<ref>{{cite journal| last         = Go| first        = Bon Juan| title        = Ma'I in Chinese Records - Mindoro or Bai?

According to sources at the time, the trade in large native [[List of Japanese tea ceremony equipment#Shimamono|''Ruson-tsukuri'']] (literally ''Luzon-made'', Japanese:[[wikt:呂|呂]][[wikt:宋|宋]][[wikt:製|製]]) clay jars used for storing [[green tea]] and [[rice wine]] with Japan flourished in the 12th century, and local [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] and [[Pangasinan people|Pangasinan]] potters had marked each jar with [[Baybayin]] letters denoting the particular urn used and the kiln the jars were manufactured in.

During the 1300s, the Javanese-centered Hindu empire of [[Majapahit]] briefly ruled over Luzon as recorded in the epic poem [[Nagarakretagama]], which stated that they had colonies in the Philippines at Saludong ([[Kingdom of Manila|Manila]]) and Solot ([[Sultanate of Sulu|Sulu]]). Eventually, the kingdoms of Luzon regained independence from Majapahit after the Battle of Manila (1365) and Sulu also reestablished independence and in vengeance, [[Military history of the Philippines|assaulted the Majapahit province of Poni]] ([[Brunei]]) before a fleet from the capital drove them out.<ref>{{cite book |title=History for Brunei Darussalam: Sharing our Past |year=2009 |publisher=Curriculum Development Department, Ministry of Education |isbn=978-99917-2-372-3 |ref={{harvid|History for Brunei Darussalam|2009}}|page=44}}</ref>

The [[Yongle Emperor]] instituted a Chinese governor on Luzon during [[Zheng He]]'s [[Treasure voyages|voyages]] and appointed Ko Ch'a-lao to that position in 1405.{{sfn|Ho|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=EwnzBiM0LmAC&pg=PA33 33]}}{{sfn|Karnow|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VbwogbQ3l8UC&pg=PT84 84]}} China also had vassals among the leaders in the archipelago.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopædia Britannica, Volume 9 |others=Contributor: Walter Yust |year=1954 |publisher=EncyclopÆdia Britannica |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9KfnAAAAMAAJ&q=vassals |access-date=2019-06-21 |page=75}}</ref> China attained ascendancy in trade with the area in Yongle's reign.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uWzjAAAAMAAJ "Philippine Almanac & Handbook of Facts" 1977], p. 59.</ref>

Afterwards, some parts of Luzon were Islamized when the former Majapahit province of Poni broke free, converted to Islam, imported an Arab prince from Saudi Arabia, in the person of [[Sharif Ali]], and became the [[Bruneian Empire|Sultanate of Brunei]], a nation that then expanded its realms from Borneo to the Philippines and set up the [[Kingdom of Maynila]] as its puppet-state<ref>{{cite book|author=Frans Welman|title=Borneo Trilogy Brunei: Vol 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kb7OXcSH7ScC&pg=PA8|date=1 August 2013|publisher=Booksmango|isbn=978-616-222-235-1|pages=8–}}</ref> as well as incorporate the newly converted Sultanate of Sulu by a royal marriage.

In the 1500s, people from Luzon were called ''[[Luções]]'' and they established many overseas communities within the Indo-Pacific and were actively employed in trading, seafaring and military campaigns across Southeast Asia.

The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first European explorers who recorded it in their charts as ''Luçonia'' or ''Luçon'' and inhabitants were called ''[[Luçoes]]''.<ref>Pires, Tomé, A suma oriental de Tomé Pires e o livro de Francisco Rodriguez: Leitura e notas de Armando Cortesão [1512–1515], translated and edited by Armando Cortesao, Cambridge: Hakluyt Society, 1944.</ref> [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]], who visited Luzon in the early 19th century, wrote that Luzon was "discovered" in 1521.<ref name=Roberts1/> Many people from Luzon had active-employment in Portuguese Malacca. Lucoes such as the Luzon spice magnate [[Regimo de Raja]], based in Malacca, was highly influential and the Portuguese appointed him as Temenggong (Sea Lord) or a governor and chief general responsible for overseeing of maritime trade, at Malacca. As Temenggung, he was also the head of an armada which traded and protected commerce between the [[Indian Ocean]], the [[Strait of Malacca]], the [[South China Sea]],<ref>Antony, Robert J.

Pinto noted that there were a number of Luçoes in the Islamic fleets that went to battle with the Portuguese in the Philippines during the 16th century. The Sultan of Aceh gave one of them (Sapetu Diraja) the task of holding Aru (northeast Sumatra) in 1540. Pinto also says one was named leader of the Malays remaining in the Moluccas Islands after the Portuguese conquest in 1511.<ref name="Pinto">{{Cite journal

However, the Luções did not only fight on the side of the Muslims. Pinto says they were also apparently among the natives of the Philippines who fought the Muslims in 1538.<ref name="Pinto"/>

On [[Mainland Southeast Asia]], Lusung/Luçoes warriors aided the Burmese king in his invasion of Siam in 1547 AD.

The Spanish arrival in the 16th century saw the incorporation of the Lucoes people and the breaking up of their kingdoms and the establishment of the [[Spanish East Indies|''Las Islas Filipinas'']] with its capital [[Cebu]], which was moved to [[Manila]] following the defeat of the local [[Rajah Sulayman]] in 1570. Under Spain, Luzon also came to be known as the '''''Nueva Castilla''''' or the '''New Castile'''. In Spanish times, Luzon became the focal point for trade between the Americas and Asia. The [[Manila Galleons]] constructed in the [[Bicol region]], brought silver mined from [[Peru]] and [[Mexico]] to Manila, which was used to purchase Asian commercial goods like Chinese [[silk]], Indian [[gems]] and Indonesian [[spices]] which were exported to the Americas. Luzon then became a focal point for global migration. The walled city of [[Intramuros]] was initially founded by 1200 Spanish families.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38269/38269-h/38269-h.htm#pb139 |title = A History of the Philippines |last = Barrows |first = David |journal = Guttenburg Free Online E-books |year = 2014 |volume = 1 |page = 179 |quote = Within the walls, there were some six hundred houses of a private nature, most of them built of stone and tile, and an equal number outside in the suburbs, or “arrabales,” all occupied by Spaniards (“todos son vivienda y poblacion de los Españoles”).

It is a case of historical names repeating itself since the Royalist army in the [[War in the Vendée]] at France which attempted to restore the French Bourbons was primarily based on the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Luçon|Diocese of Luçon]].

After many years of Spanish occupation and resistance to reform, the [[Philippine Revolution]] against Spain erupted in Cavite and spread all throughout Luzon and the Philippines. Consequently, the [[First Philippine Republic]] was established in [[Malolos, Bulacan]]. In the meantime, [[Spain]] sold the Philippines to the [[United States]] and the First Philippine Republic resisted the new American colonizers in the [[Philippine–American War]] which the Republic lost due to its diplomatic isolation (No nation recognized the First Republic) as well as due to the numerical superiority of the American army. The Americans then set up the cool mountain city of [[Baguio City|Baguio]] as a summer retreat for its officials. The Americans also rebuilt the capital, Manila, and established American military bases in [[Olongapo]] and [[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarkab.org/history/index.htm |title=Clark Air Base History |publisher=Clarkab.org |access-date=2009-07-14}}</ref>

In [[Pacific War|World War II]], the Philippines were considered to be of great strategic importance because their capture by Japan would pose a significant threat to the U.S. As a result, 135,000 troops and 227 aircraft were stationed in the Philippines by October 1941. Luzon was captured by [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese forces]] in 1942 during their [[Philippines Campaign (1941–42)|campaign to capture the Philippines]]. [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]—who was in charge of the defense of the Philippines at the time—was ordered to Australia, and the remaining U.S. forces retreated to the [[Bataan Peninsula]].<ref name="2ww">{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWphilippines.htm |title=The Philippines |access-date=6 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222190510/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWphilippines.htm |archive-date=22 February 2009 }}</ref>

A few months after this, MacArthur expressed his belief that an attempt to recapture the Philippines was necessary. The U.S. Pacific Commander [[Admiral]] [[Chester Nimitz]] and [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Ernest King]] both opposed this idea, arguing that it must wait until victory was certain. MacArthur had to wait two years for his wish; it was 1944 before a [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|campaign]] to recapture the Philippines was launched. The island of [[Leyte]] was the first objective of the campaign, which was [[Battle of Leyte|captured]] by the end of December 1944. This was followed by the [[Battle of Mindoro|attack on Mindoro]] and later, Luzon.<ref name="2ww"/>

The end of the World War necessitated [[decolonization]] due to rising nationalist movements across the world's many empires. Subsequently, the Philippines gained independence from the United States. Luzon then arose to become the most developed island in the Philippines. However, the lingering poverty and inequality caused by the long dictatorship of US-supported dictator, [[Ferdinand Marcos]], gave rise to the Philippine diaspora and many people from Luzon have migrated elsewhere and had established large overseas communities; mainly in the [[United States]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. Eventually, the [[People Power Revolution]] led by [[Corazon Aquino]] and [[Jaime Sin|Cardinal Jaime Sin]], removed Marcos and his cronies from power and they fled to [[Hawaii]] where the US granted them asylum. The following administrations are subsequently managing the political and economic recovery of the Philippines with the particular aim of spreading development outside of Luzon and into the more isolated provinces of the [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]].

It is bordered on the west by the [[South China Sea]] (''Luzon Sea'' in Philippine territorial waters), on the east by the [[Philippine Sea]], and on the north by the [[Luzon Strait]] containing the [[Babuyan Islands|Babuyan]] Channel and [[Balintang Channel]]. The [[mainland]] is roughly rectangular in shape and has the long [[Bicol Peninsula]] protruding to the southeast.

Luzon is roughly divided into four sections; [[Northern Luzon|Northern]], [[Central Luzon|Central]] and [[Southern Luzon|Southern]] Luzon, and the [[National Capital Region]].

===Physical===
==== Northern Luzon ====
The northwestern portion of the island, which encompasses most of the [[Ilocos Region]], is characterized by a flat terrain extending east from the [[coast]]line toward the [[Cordillera Central, Luzon|Cordillera Central mountains]].

The Cordillera mountain range, which feature the island's north-central section, is covered in a mixture of [[Luzon tropical pine forests|tropical pine forests]] and [[Luzon rainforest|montane rainforests]], and is the site of the island's highest mountain, [[Mount Pulag]], rising at 2,922 metres. The range provides the upland headwaters of the [[Agno River]], which stretches from the slopes of [[Mount Data]], and meanders along the southern Cordillera mountains before reaching the plains of [[Pangasinan]].

The northeastern section of Luzon is generally mountainous, with the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]], the longest mountain range in the country, abruptly rising a few miles from the coastline. Located in between the Sierra Madre and the Cordillera Central mountain ranges is the large [[Cagayan Valley]]. This region, which is known for being the second largest producer of rice and the country's top corn-producer, serves as the [[Drainage basin|basin]] for the [[Cagayan River]], the longest in the Philippines.

Along the southern limits of the Cordillera Central lies the lesser-known [[Caraballo Mountains]]. These mountains form a link between the Cordillera Central and the Sierra Madre mountain ranges, separating the Cagayan Valley from the [[Central Luzon]] plains.<ref name=TriumphPhil>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Robert Ross|title=Triumph in the Philippines|date=1993|publisher=University Press of the Pacific|location=Honolulu, HI|isbn=1410224953|page=450|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-Triumph/USA-P-Triumph-24.html|access-date=25 December 2014|format=Transcribed and formatted by Jerry Holden for the HyperWar Foundation}}</ref>

==== Central Luzon ====
[[File:Arayat44jf.JPG|thumb|The [[Central Luzon]] plain with [[Mount Arayat]] in the background]]
The central section of Luzon is characterized by a flat terrain, known as the Central Luzon [[plain]], the largest in the island in terms of land area. The plain, approximately {{convert|11,000|km2}} in size, is the country's largest producer of rice, and is irrigated by two major rivers; the [[Cagayan River|Cagayan]] to the north, and the [[Pampanga River|Pampanga]] to the south. In the middle of the plain rises the solitary [[Mount Arayat]].

The western coasts of Central Luzon are typically flat extending east from the coastline to the [[Zambales Mountains]], the site of [[Mount Pinatubo]], made famous because of its enormous [[1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo|1991 eruption]]. These mountains extend to the sea in the north, forming the [[Lingayen Gulf]], and to the south, forming the [[Bataan Peninsula]]. The peninsula encloses the [[Manila Bay]], a natural [[harbor]] considered to be one of the best natural ports in East Asia, due to its size and strategic geographical location.

The [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountain range continues to stretch across the western section of Central Luzon, snaking southwards into the [[Bicol Peninsula]].

The northern section of Southern Luzon is dominated by the [[Laguna de Bay]] ([[Old Spanish]], "''Lake of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]] town''"), the largest [[lake]] in the country. The {{convert|949|km2|adj=on}} lake is drained into [[Manila Bay]] by the [[Pasig River]], one of the most important rivers in the country due to its historical significance and because it runs through the center of [[Metro Manila]].

Located {{convert|20|km}} southwest of Laguna de Bay is [[Taal Lake]], a [[Volcanic crater lake|crater lake]] containing the [[Taal Volcano]], the smallest in the country. The environs of the lake form the [[highland|upland]] [[Tagaytay Ridge]], which was once part of a massive prehistoric volcano that covered the southern portion of the province of [[Cavite]], [[Tagaytay City]] and the whole of [[Batangas]] province.

South of Laguna Lake are two [[Topographic prominence|solitary]] mountains, [[Mount Makiling]] in [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] province, and [[Mount Banahaw]], the highest in the region of [[Calabarzon]].

The southeastern portion of Luzon is dominated by the [[Bicol Peninsula]], a mountainous and narrow region extending approximately {{convert|150|km}} southeast from the [[Tayabas Isthmus]] in [[Quezon (province)|Quezon]] province to the [[San Bernardino Strait]] along the coasts of [[Sorsogon (province)|Sorsogon]]. The area is home to several [[volcano]]es, the most famous of which is the {{convert|2,460|m|adj=on}} high symmetrically shaped [[Mayon Volcano]] in [[Albay]] province. The [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] range has its southern limits at Quezon province. [[Topographic prominence|Ultra-prominent]] mountains dot the landscape, which include [[Mount Isarog]] and [[Mount Iriga]] in [[Camarines Sur]], and [[Mount Bulusan]] in [[Sorsogon]].

The [[peninsula]]'s coastline features several smaller peninsulas, [[List of gulfs|gulf]]s and [[bay]]s, which include [[Lamon Bay]], [[San Miguel Bay]], [[Lagonoy Gulf]], [[Ragay Gulf]], and [[Sorsogon Bay]].

{{wide image|Legazpi City at Night.jpg|1000px|The nearly perfectly shaped [[Mayon Volcano]] and the city of [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi]] in [[Albay]] province|alt=Panorama of city of Legazpi with Mayon Volcano in the background}}

==== Outlying islands ====
Several outlying islands near mainland Luzon are considered part of the [[Island groups of the Philippines|Luzon island group]].
The largest include [[Palawan (island)|Palawan]], [[Mindoro]], [[Masbate Island|Masbate]], [[Catanduanes]], [[Marinduque]], [[Romblon Island|Romblon]] and [[Polillo Island|Polillo]].

{{further|Island groups of the Philippines}}

===Administrative divisions===
The island is covered by 8 [[Regions of the Philippines|administrative regions]], 30 [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] and, {{As of|2014|lc=y}}, 68 [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]] (8 regions, 38 provinces and 71 cities if [[Island groups of the Philippines|associated islands]] are included). One of the regions, [[Mimaropa]], is geographically part of the [[Visayas]] according to the non-centric view. This is contested by imperial Manila through the Manila-centric view. Majority of scholars in the Philippines consider Mimaropa as part of the Visayas, in line with the non-centric view.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

===Tectonics===
{{Main|Philippine Mobile Belt}}
[[File:Lake Pinatubo in January, 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Pinatubo]] in [[Zambales]]]]
Luzon is part of the [[Philippine Mobile Belt]], a fast deforming plate boundary zone (Gervasio, 1967) hemmed in between two opposing subduction zones, the west-dipping [[Philippine Trench]]-[[East Luzon Trench]] subduction zone, and the east-dipping north–south trending [[Manila Trench]]-[[Negros (island)|Negros]] Trench-[[Cotabato Trench]].<ref>Hashimoto, M, ed., ''Accretion Tectonics in the Circum-Pacific Regions'', {{ISBN|90-277-1561-0}} p299</ref>  The [[Philippine Sea Plate]] subducts under eastern Luzon along the East Luzon Trench and the Philippine Trench, while the [[South China Sea]] basin, part of the [[Eurasian plate]], subducts under western Luzon along the Manila Trench.

The North-Southeastern trending braided left-lateral strike-slip [[Philippine Fault System]] traverses Luzon, from [[Quezon province]] and [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] to the northwestern part of the island. This fault system takes up part of the motion due to the subducting plates and produces large earthquakes. Southwest of Luzon is a collision zone where the Palawan micro-block collides with SW Luzon, producing a highly seismic zone near [[Mindoro]] island. Southwest Luzon is characterized by a highly volcanic zone, called the Macolod Corridor, a region of crustal thinning and spreading.

Using geologic and structural data, seven principal blocks were identified in Luzon in 1989: the Sierra Madre Oriental, Angat, [[Zambales]], [[Central Cordillera of Luzon]], Bicol, and [[Catanduanes Island]] blocks.<ref>Rangin and Pubellier in ''Tectonics of Circum-Pacific Continental Margins'' {{ISBN|90-6764-132-4}} p148 fig 4</ref>  Using seismic and geodetic data, Luzon was modeled by Galgana et al. (2007) as a series of six micro blocks or micro plates (separated by subduction zones and intra-arc faults), all translating and rotating in different directions, with maximum velocities ~100&nbsp;mm/yr NW with respect to Sundaland/Eurasia.

===Ethnic groups===
[[File:Ifugao headhunter.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[Igorot people|Ifugao]] warrior with some of his trophies, Cordillera Mountains, circa 1912]]

Seven major [[Filipinos|Philippine]] [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups predominate Luzon. [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]] dominate northern Luzon, while [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangans]] and [[Pangasinan people|Pangasinenses]], as well as [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]] and [[Sambal people|Sambals]], populate [[Central Luzon]]. [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]s dominate the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]], [[Calabarzon]] and the island provinces of [[Marinduque]] and [[Mindoro]], while [[Bicolano people|Bicolanos]] populate the southern [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] peninsula. [[Visayans]] mainly predominate in the island provinces of [[Masbate]], [[Palawan]] and [[Romblon]].

Other ethnic groups lesser in population include the [[Aeta]]s of [[Zambales]] and [[Bataan]], the [[Ibanag people|Ibanags]] of [[Cagayan province|Cagayan]] and [[Isabela province|Isabela]], along with smaller groups like the [[Gaddang people|Gaddang]] of [[Nueva Vizcaya]], and the [[Igorot|Igorot/Cordillerans]] of the [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordilleras]].

{{Further|Ethnic groups of the Philippines}}

Due to recent migrations, populations of [[Filipino Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Moro people|Moros]] have also been present in urban areas. [[Filipino mestizo|Mixed-race]] populations of [[Filipinos of Spanish descent|Spanish]], [[Filipinos of American descent|Americans]], [[Filipinos of Japanese descent|Japanese]], [[Koreans in the Philippines|Koreans]], [[Filipinos of Indian descent|Indians]],  and [[Arabs]] are also visible. The Chinese and their mixed-raced descendants are spread all across Luzon. According to old Spanish censuses, around 1/3rd of the population of Luzon are admixed with either Spanish or Latino descent (Mostly in Cavite and Manila)<ref>Jagor, Fëdor, et al. (1870). [http://www.authorama.com/former-philippines-b-8.html ''The Former Philippines thru Foreign Eyes'']</ref> Most Americans have settled in Central Luzon's highly urbanized cities of [[Angeles, Philippines|Angeles]] and [[Olongapo City|Olongapo]] due to the former presence of the U.S. air and naval bases in there, while a majority of the Koreans and Japanese have mainly settled in the major cities and towns.

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of the Philippines}}
[[File:Philippine languages per region.png|thumb|left|upright|Dominant languages per administrative region.]]
Almost all of the languages of Luzon belong to the [[Philippine languages|Philippine]] group of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. Major regional languages include: [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], [[Bicolano language|Bicolano]], [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]], and [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]].

[[Philippine English|English]] is spoken by many inhabitants. The use of [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] as an [[official language]] declined following the [[American occupation of the Philippines]]. Almost inexistent among the general populace, Spanish is still used by the elderly of some families of great tradition (Rizal, Liboro...).

{{Main|Religion in the Philippines}}

Like most of the Philippines, the major religion in Luzon is [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianity]], with [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Roman Catholicism]] being the major [[Christian denomination|denomination]]. Other major sects includes [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Protestantism in the Philippines|Protestantism]], the [[Philippine Independent Church]] (Aglipayans), the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and the [[Iglesia ni Cristo]].<ref>[https://www.census.gov.ph/old/data/pressrelease/2003/pr0323tx.html PHILIPPINES: ADDITIONAL THREE PERSONS PER MINUTE] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305074956/http://www.census.gov.ph/old/data/pressrelease/2003/pr0323tx.html |date=2016-03-05 }}, [https://www.census.gov.ph/ National Statistics Office] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004104825/http://census.gov.ph/ |date=2013-10-04 }}. Last revised: July 18, 2003. Retrieved November 27, 2006.</ref> Indigenous traditions and rituals, though rare, are also present.

There are also sizable communities of [[Hinduism in the Philippines|Hindu]]s, [[Buddhism in the Philippines|Buddhist]]s and [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim]]s in [[Metro Manila]] and in other, especially, urban areas due to the immigration of [[Moro people|Moros]] and [[Filipino Chinese|Chinese]] to the island.

==Economy==
The economy of the island is centered in [[Metro Manila]] with [[Makati]] serving as the main economic and financial hub. Major companies such as [[Ayala Corporation|Ayala]], [[Jollibee Foods Corporation]], [[SM Group]], and [[Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company|Metrobank]] are based in the business districts of [[Makati]], [[Ortigas Center]], and [[Bonifacio Global City]]. Industry is concentrated in and around the urban areas of Metro Manila while agriculture predominates in the other regions of the island producing crops such as rice, bananas, mangoes, coconuts, pineapple, and coffee.<ref>[https://www.census.gov.ph/data/sectordata/dataagri.html Index of Agriculture and Fishery Statistics].
