A person is guilty of '''obstructing government administration''' if the person intentionally interferes by force, [[violence]] or [[intimidation]] or by any physical act with a public servant performing or purporting to perform an official function. This goes for the obstruction of any police officer, constable, sheriff's deputy, conservation ranger, state trooper, detective, or any EMT or other authorized medical technician or firefighter with violence or force during the performance of their duties. Also it is a felony for any person to interfere with any government official such as any duly sworn law enforcement official such as any police officer, prison guard, corrections officer, conservation ranger, marshal, sheriff's deputy, jailer, or probation officer by the expelling or throwing of human or animal urine, feces, blood, vomitus, or seminal fluid on him or her while engaging in the performance of his or her official duties.
