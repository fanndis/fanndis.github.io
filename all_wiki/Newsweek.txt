'''''Newsweek''''' is an American weekly [[news magazine]] founded in 1933. ''Newsweek'' was a widely distributed newsweekly through the 20th century, with many notable editors-in-chief throughout the years. ''Newsweek'' was acquired by [[The Washington Post Company]] in 1961, under whose ownership it remained until 2010.  Between 2008 and 2012, ''Newsweek'' experienced financial difficulties, leading to the cessation of print publication and a transition to all-digital format at the end of 2012. The print edition then relaunched in March 2014 under different ownership.

Revenue declines prompted an August 2010 sale by The Washington Post Company to audio pioneer [[Sidney Harman]]—for a purchase price of one dollar and an assumption of the magazine's liabilities.<ref name="nytsale"/> Later that year, ''Newsweek'' merged with the news and opinion website ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', forming [[The Newsweek Daily Beast Company]]. ''Newsweek'' was jointly owned by the estate of Harman and the diversified American media and Internet company [[IAC (company)|IAC]].<ref name="merger">{{Cite web|title=''Daily Beast'', ''Newsweek'' to Wed!|work=The Daily Beast|author=Tina Brown|date=November 11, 2010|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-11/the-daily-beast-and-newsweek-to-wed/|accessdate=November 12, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112153155/http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-11/the-daily-beast-and-newsweek-to-wed/|archivedate=November 12, 2010}}</ref><ref name="merger2">{{Cite web|title=''The Daily Beast'' and ''Newsweek'' confirm merger|work=The Spy Report|date=November 12, 2010|url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/11/12/us-the-daily-beast-and-newsweek-confirm-merger/|accessdate=November 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116122621/http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/11/12/us-the-daily-beast-and-newsweek-confirm-merger/|archive-date=November 16, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2013, [[IBT Media]] announced it had acquired ''Newsweek'' from IAC; the acquisition included the ''Newsweek'' brand and its online publication, but did not include ''The Daily Beast''.<ref name="ibtpr"/> IBT Media rebranded itself as Newsweek Media Group in 2017 and rebranded back to IBT Media in 2018 after the spin-off.

===Founding and early years (1933–1961)===

''News-Week'' was launched in 1933 by [[Thomas J. C. Martyn]], a former foreign-news editor for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. He obtained financial backing from a group of U.S. stockholders "which included [[Ward Cheney]], of the Cheney silk family, [[John Hay Whitney]], and [[Paul Mellon]], son of [[Andrew W. Mellon]]". Paul Mellon's ownership in ''Newsweek'' apparently represented "the first attempt of the Mellon family to function journalistically on a national scale".<ref>''America's 60 Families'' by [[Ferdinand Lundberg]]</ref> The group of original owners invested around $2.5 million. Other large stockholders prior to 1946 were public utilities investment banker Stanley Childs and Wall Street corporate lawyer Wilton Lloyd-Smith.

Journalist [[Samuel T. Williamson]] served as the first editor-in-chief of ''Newsweek''. The first issue of the magazine was dated February 17, 1933. Seven [[photograph]]s from the week's news were printed on the first issue's cover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bztv.typepad.com/instanthistory/2007/02/newsweek_1_a_lo.html|title=Instant History: Review of First ''Newsweek'' with Cover Photo|work=BZTV|date=February 17, 1933|accessdate=December 25, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025034807/http://bztv.typepad.com/instanthistory/2007/02/newsweek_1_a_lo.html|archivedate=October 25, 2012}}</ref>

In 1937 ''News-Week'' merged with the weekly journal ''Today'', which had been founded in 1932 by future New York Governor and diplomat [[W. Averell Harriman]], and [[Vincent Astor]] of the prominent Astor family. As a result of the deal, Harriman and Astor provided $600,000 in venture capital funds and Vincent Astor became both the chairman of the board and its principal stockholder between 1937 and his death in 1959.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 1937 [[Malcolm Muir]] took over as president and editor-in-chief. He changed the name to ''Newsweek'', emphasized interpretive stories, introduced signed columns, and launched international editions. Over time the magazine developed a broad spectrum of material, from breaking stories and analysis to reviews and commentary.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The financial results for 2009 as reported by The Washington Post Company showed that advertising revenue for ''Newsweek'' was down 37% in 2009 and the magazine division reported an operating loss for 2009 of $29.3 million compared to a loss of $16 million in 2008.<ref name="bbc020810">[http://www.washpostco.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=62487&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1394732&highlight=Washington Post Financial Release] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017091241/http://www.washpostco.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=62487&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1394732&highlight=Washington |date=October 17, 2015 }} February 24, 2010</ref> During the first quarter of 2010, the magazine lost nearly $11 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Newsweek magazine is sold by Washington Post|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-10847466|date=August 2, 2010|accessdate=August 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803191418/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-10847466|archive-date=August 3, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

More room was made available in the front of the magazine for columnists, editors, and special guests. A new "News Gallery" section featured two-page spreads of photographs from the week with a brief article accompanying each one. The "NewsBeast" section featured short articles, a brief interview with a newsmaker, and several graphs and charts for quick reading in the style of ''The Daily Beast''. This is where the ''Newsweek'' staple "Conventional Wisdom" was located. Brown retained ''Newsweek''{{'s}} focus on in-depth, analytical features and original reporting on politics and world affairs, as well as a new focus on longer fashion and pop culture features. A larger culture section named "Omnivore" featured art, music, books, film, theater, food, travel, and television, including a weekly "Books" and "Want" section. The back page was reserved for a "My Favorite Mistake" column written by celebrity guest columnists about a mistake they made that helped shape who they are.<ref name="relaunch"/>

====Cessation of print format (2012)====

===Allegations of sexism===
In 1970, [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] represented sixty female employees of ''Newsweek'' who had filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that ''Newsweek'' had a policy of only allowing men to be reporters.<ref name="Newsweek"/> The women won, and ''Newsweek'' agreed to allow women to be reporters.<ref name=Newsweek/> The day the claim was filed, ''Newsweek'''s cover article was "Women in Revolt", covering the feminist movement; the article was written by [[Helen Dudar]], a freelancer, on the belief that there were no female writers at the magazine capable of handling the assignment.

=== Factual errors ===
Unlike most large American magazines, ''Newsweek'' has not used fact-checkers since 1996. In 1997, the magazine was forced to recall several hundred thousand copies of a special issue called ''Your Child'', which advised that infants as young as five months old could safely feed themselves [[zwieback]] toasts and chunks of raw carrot (to the contrary, both represent a choking hazard in children this young). The error was later attributed to a copy editor who was working on two stories at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poynter.org/news/newsweek-ditched-its-fact-checkers-1996-then-made-major-error|title=Newsweek ditched its fact-checkers in 1996, then made a major error|website=Poynter|language=en|access-date=September 9, 2018|date=August 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910014608/https://www.poynter.org/news/newsweek-ditched-its-fact-checkers-1996-then-made-major-error|archive-date=September 10, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the firings were announced, senior writer Matthew Cooper quit in protest. In a resignation letter that he posted on Twitter, Cooper denounced Newsweek Media Group both for the firings and for what he called a pattern of "reckless leadership".<ref name=":3" />

[[Fareed Zakaria]], a ''Newsweek'' columnist and editor of ''Newsweek International'', attended a secret meeting on November 29, 2001, with a dozen policy makers, Middle East experts and members of influential policy research organizations that produced a report for President [[George W. Bush]] and his cabinet outlining a strategy for dealing with Afghanistan and the Middle East in the aftermath of [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]]. The meeting was held at the request of [[Paul Wolfowitz|Paul D. Wolfowitz]], then the [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]]. The unusual presence of journalists, who also included [[Robert D. Kaplan]] of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', at such a strategy meeting was revealed in [[Bob Woodward]]'s 2006 book ''[[State of Denial: Bush at War, Part III]]''. Woodward reported in his book that, according to Kaplan, everyone at the meeting signed confidentiality agreements not to discuss what happened. Zakaria told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that he attended the meeting for several hours but did not recall being told that a report for the president would be produced.<ref name="NYT_Bosman">Julie Bosman.

The cover story of the January 15, 2015, issue, titled ''What Silicon Valley Thinks of Women'' proved controversial, due to both its illustration, described as "the cartoon of a faceless female in spiky red heels, having her dress lifted up by a [[Cursor (computing)|cursor]] arrow", and its content, described as "a 5,000-word article on the creepy, sexist culture of the tech industry".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burleigh|first=Nina|date=January 28, 2015|title=What Silicon Valley Thinks of Women|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/06/what-silicon-valley-thinks-women-302821.html|journal=Newsweek|accessdate=March 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321113800/http://www.newsweek.com/2015/02/06/what-silicon-valley-thinks-women-302821.html|archive-date=March 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="grove201501">{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/29/is-newsweek-s-red-heels-cover-image-sexist.html|title=Is ''Newsweek''{{'s}} 'Red Heels' Cover Image Sexist?|last=Grove|first=Lloyd|date=January 29, 2015|work=Daily Beast|accessdate=March 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326071432/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/29/is-newsweek-s-red-heels-cover-image-sexist.html|archive-date=March 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Among those offended by the cover were ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]]'' co-host [[Tamron Hall]], who commented "I think it's obscene and just despicable, honestly."

In January 1998, ''Newsweek'' reporter [[Michael Isikoff]] was the first reporter to investigate allegations of a sexual relationship between U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Monica Lewinsky]], but the editors [[Spike (journalism)|spiked]] the story.<ref name="BBC19980125">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/clinton_scandal/50031.stm|title=Scandalous scoop breaks online|date=January 25, 1998|work=BBC|accessdate=July 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728021921/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/clinton_scandal/50031.stm|archive-date=July 28, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The story soon surfaced online in the [[Drudge Report]].

In December 2019, journalist Tareq Haddad said he resigned from ''Newsweek'' when it refused to publish his story about documents published by [[WikiLeaks]] concerning the [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]]' report into the 2018 [[Douma chemical attack]]. Haddad said his information was inconvenient to the US government which had retaliated after the chemical attack. A Newsweek spokesperson responded that Haddad "pitched a conspiracy theory rather than an idea for objective reporting. Newsweek editors rejected the pitch."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dorman |first1=Sam |title=Newsweek reporter quits, claiming outlet 'suppressed' story on global chemical weapons watchdog |url=https://www.foxnews.com/media/newsweek-reporter-tareq-haddad-quits |accessdate=January 5, 2020 |publisher=Fox News |date=December 7, 2019}}</ref>

In August 2020, just after [[Kamala Harris]] was picked as running-mate by Joe Biden for the presidential election, ''Newsweek'' published an opinion piece by [[John C. Eastman]], a law professor and former Dean of Chapman University Law School. Eastman argued that Harris would not be eligible to become vice-president because her parents were not American citizens at the time of her birth. This idea was contradictory with American jurisprudence since at least 1898 (the [[United States v. Wong Kim Ark|Wong Kim Ark ruling]]), and the opinion piece was heavily criticized by law experts and readers.
