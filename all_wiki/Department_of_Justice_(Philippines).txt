The '''Department of Justice''' ({{lang-fil|Kagawaran ng Katarungan}}, abbreviated as '''DOJ''') is under the [[Executive departments of the Philippines|executive department]] of the [[Philippine government]] responsible for upholding the [[rule of law]] in the Philippines. It is the government's principal law agency, serving as its legal counsel and prosecution arm.<ref>{{cite web|title=Department of Justice – Vision, Mission and Mandate|url=http://www.doj.gov.ph/vision-mission-and-mandate.html|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}</ref> It has its headquarters at the DOJ Building in [[Padre Faura Street]], [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]], [[Manila]].

The department is led by the [[Secretary of Justice (Philippines)|Secretary of Justice]], nominated by the [[President of the Philippines]] and confirmed by the [[Commission on Appointments (Philippines)|Commission on Appointments]]. The Secretary is a member of the [[Cabinet of the Philippines|Cabinet]]. Duterte named [[Vitaliano Aguirre II]] as secretary<ref name="gma">{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/566799/news/nation/vitaliano-aguirre-is-duterte-s-secretary-of-justice |title=Vitaliano Aguirre is Duterte's secretary of justice |publisher=[[GMA News]] |date=May 18, 2016 |accessdate=June 26, 2016}}</ref> until his resignation and was replaced by [[Menardo Guevarra]].

==History==
The DOJ traces its beginnings at the Revolutionary Assembly in [[Naic, Cavite|Naic]], [[Cavite]] on April 17, 1897. The ''Department of Grace and Justice'' was tasked with the establishment of a regime of law in the Republic, with Severino de las Alas at the helm.<ref name="doj-history">{{cite web|title=History of the Department of Justice|url=http://www.doj.gov.ph/history-of-doj.html|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}</ref> The department, however, was not included in Pres. Aguinaldo's [[Biak-na-Bato Republic|Biak-na-Bato]] Cabinet, which was established in November 1897.

Shortly after the proclamation of independence on June 12, 1898, President [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] resurrected the department as the ''Department of Justice'' via a September 26, 1898 decree.<ref>{{cite web|title=Today in Philippine History, September 26, 1898, Araneta and Buencamino were appointed to the Aguinaldo cabinet|url=http://kahimyang.info/kauswagan/history_current_events/1282-today_in_philippine_history___september_26__1898___araneta_and_buencamino_were_appointed_to_the_aguinaldo_cabinet|work=The Kahimyang Project|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}</ref>  The department, however, disappeared again in Pres. Aguinaldo's Cabinet upon the proclamation of the [[First Philippine Republic|First Republic]] in 1899.

After the American occupation a year later, the military government established the ''Office of the Attorney of the Supreme Court''. On June 11, 1901, it was renamed the ''Office of the Attorney General'' and on September 1 of the same year, the office became the ''Department of Finance and Justice''.

In 1916, the department became a separate entity (once again the Department of Justice) by virtue of the [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Jones Law]], and was given administrative  supervision over all courts of first instance and other inferior courts.<ref name="doj-history" />

Under the Japanese occupation, the department became the ''Commission of Justice'', and later the ''Ministry of Justice'' upon the proclamation of the [[Second Philippine Republic]] in 1943. After the country's liberation from the Japanese forces near the end of [[World War II]], the restored [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth government]] re-activated the Department.

Soon,  the Supreme Court under the then 1973 Constitution took over the administrative supervision of all lower courts from the DOJ. The succeeding 1987 Constitution upheld it.

It became the Ministry of Justice once more in 1973 during [[Martial Law in the Philippines|Martial Law]], continuing in that form until 1987, when the return to a presidential form of government as mandated by the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1987 Constitution]] transformed all ministries back to departments.
Today, the DOJ continues to pursue its primary mission "To Uphold the Rule of Law" with its "Justice for All" motto. The Office of the Secretary (OSEC) is composed of the National Prosecution Service, the Legal Staff, the Administrative, Financial, Technical and Planning and Management Services and the Board of Pardons and Parole. The constituent and attached agencies include the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Bureau of Immigration (BI), Public Attomey’s Office (PAO), Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), Office of the Government Corporate Counsel (OGCC), Bureau of Corrections (BuCOR), Parole and Probation Administration (PPA), Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) and the Land Registration Authority (LRA).
