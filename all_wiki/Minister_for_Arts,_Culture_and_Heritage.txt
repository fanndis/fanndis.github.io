The '''Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage''' is a [[minister (government)|minister]] in the government of New Zealand with responsibility for arts, culture, heritage, and broadcasting, and is in charge of the [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]. The position was established in 1975 as Minister for the Arts.

The present Minister is [[Carmel Sepuloni]]<ref>https://dpmc.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2020-11/ministerial-list-2-nov-2020.pdf</ref>.

==History==
The [[Third National Government of New Zealand]] established a ministerial portfolio with responsibility for the arts at its election in 1975. This reflected a growing interest of the Government in the cultural sector.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.mch.govt.nz/about-ministry/overview/history-government-involvement-culture|title=History of Government involvement in culture|website=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> The name of the portfolio changed to "Minister for Arts and Culture" in 1987. During this period, the portfolio was serviced by the [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of Internal Affairs]].<ref name="history"/>

A separate portfolio, Minister responsible for the [[New Zealand Symphony Orchestra]], was established in 1987. This was held first by [[Jonathan Hunt (New Zealand politician)|Jonathan Hunt]] (24 August 1987 – 9 February 1990)<ref name="Wood">{{cite book|title=Ministers and Members in the New Zealand Parliament|editor=G.A. Wood|edition=2nd|publisher=University of Otago Press|location=Dunedin|pages=68–76}}</ref> and subsequently by [[Margaret Austin]] (also the Minister for Arts and Culture; 9 February 1990 – 2 November 1990)<ref name="Wood"/> before being subsumed back into the responsibilities of the Minister for Arts and Culture.

A standalone agency, the Ministry for Cultural Affairs, was established by the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|Fourth National Government]] in 1991, which necessitated the change of title to "Minister for Cultural Affairs." With the creation of the [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] in 1999, which brought together cultural and heritage responsibilities in the same agency, the portfolio title changed to match its department. The present name was adopted in November 1999 at the election of the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]].
