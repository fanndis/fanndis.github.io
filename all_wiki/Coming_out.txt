'''Coming out of the closet''', often shortened to '''coming out''', is a [[metaphor]] for [[LGBT]] people's [[self-disclosure]] of their [[sexual orientation]] or of their [[gender identity]].

Framed and debated as a [[privacy]] issue, coming out of the closet is described and experienced variously as a psychological process or journey;<ref name="Coming Out: A Journey">{{cite web |url=http://utahpridecenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=25&Itemid=44 |title=Coming Out: A Journey |publisher=Utahpridecenter.org |access-date=2009-06-24 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825202112/http://utahpridecenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=25&Itemid=44 |archive-date=2009-08-25 }}</ref> [[decision-making]] or [[Risk|risk-taking]]; a strategy or plan; a mass or public event; a [[speech act]] and a matter of [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]]; a [[rite of passage]]; [[liberty|liberation]] or [[emancipation]] from [[oppression]]; an [[wikt:ordeal|ordeal]];<ref>''Belfast Telegraph'': [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/gaa-star-donal-og-cusack-teammates-helped-me-through-ordeal-of-revealing-i-am-gay-14536491.html "GAA star Donal Og Cusack: Teammates helped me through ordeal of revealing I am gay," October 20, 2009], accessed January 16, 2012</ref> a means toward feeling [[gay pride]] instead of [[shame]] and [[social stigma]]; or even career suicide.<ref>Queerty: [http://www.queerty.com/rupert-everett-says-coming-out-killed-his-career-20090220/ Japhy Grant, "Rupert Everett Says Coming Out Killed His Career," February 20, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015003811/http://www.queerty.com/rupert-everett-says-coming-out-killed-his-career-20090220/ |date=October 15, 2010 }}, accessed January 16, 2012</ref> Author [[Steven Seidman]] writes that "it is the power of the closet to shape the core of an individual's life that has made homosexuality into a significant personal, social, and political drama in twentieth-century America".<ref>Seidman, Steven (2003).

''Coming out of the closet'' is the source of other [[gay slang]] expressions related to voluntary disclosure or lack thereof. LGBT people who have already revealed or no longer conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity are ''out'', i.e. openly LGBT. Oppositely, LGBT people who have yet to come out or have opted not to do so are labelled as [[Closeted|closeted or being in the closet]]. [[Outing]] is the deliberate or accidental disclosure of an LGBT person's sexual orientation or gender identity, without their consent. By extension, ''outing oneself'' is self-disclosure. ''Glass closet'' means the [[open secret]] of when public figures' being LGBT is considered a widely accepted fact even though they have not officially come out.<ref>''OUT'' magazine: [http://www.out.com/entertainment/2008/09/22/glass-closet Michael Musto, "The Glass Closet," September 22, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705232840/http://www.out.com/entertainment/2008/09/22/glass-closet |date=July 5, 2012 }}, accessed January 16, 2012</ref>

[[File:Karl Heinrich Ulrichs.jpg|thumb|19th-century gay rights advocate [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] introduced the idea of coming out as a means of emancipation.]]
In 1869, one hundred years before the [[Stonewall riots]], the German homosexual rights advocate [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] introduced the idea of self-disclosure as a means of [[emancipation]]. Claiming that invisibility was a major obstacle toward changing [[public opinion]], he urged homosexual people to reveal their same-sex attractions.{{cn|date=July 2020}} In an interview, [[Robert Beachy]] said "I think it is reasonable to describe [Ulrichs] as the first gay person to publicly out himself."<ref name="Stack-2020">{{cite web |last=Stack |first=Liam |title=Overlooked No More: Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, Pioneering Gay Activist |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/obituaries/karl-heinrich-ulrichs-overlooked.html |date=1 July 2020 }}</ref>

In his 1906 work, ''Das Sexualleben unserer Zeit in seinen Beziehungen zur modernen Kultur'' (''The Sexual Life of Our Time in its Relation to Modern Civilization''),<ref>Bloch, Ivan. ''Das Sexualleben unserer Zeit in seinen Beziehungen zur modernen Kultur'', 1906. English translation: ''The Sexual Life of Our Time in Its Relations to Modern Civilization'', 1910.</ref> [[Iwan Bloch]], a German-Jewish physician, entreated elderly homosexuals to self-disclose to their family members and acquaintances. In 1914, [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] revisited the topic in his major work ''The Homosexuality of Men and Women'', discussing the social and legal potentials of several thousand homosexual men and women of rank revealing their sexual orientation to the police in order to influence legislators and public opinion.<ref>Johansson&Percy, p.24</ref>

The first prominent American to reveal his homosexuality was the poet [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]]. In 1944, using his own name in the anarchist magazine ''Politics'', he wrote that homosexuals were an oppressed minority.<ref>[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15949 "Robert Duncan and Romantic Synthesis: A Few Notes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906020604/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15949 |date=2010-09-06 }}. This article also republished as "On Robert Duncan" at Modern American Poetry website</ref> The decidedly clandestine [[Mattachine Society]], founded by [[Harry Hay]] and other veterans of the [[Henry A. Wallace|Wallace for President]] campaign in Los Angeles in 1950, moved into the public eye after Hal Call took over the group in San Francisco in 1953, with many gays emerging from the closet.

In 1951, [[Donald Webster Cory]]<ref name=sagarin>{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html|title=Donald Webster Cory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151656/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html |archive-date=2009-06-06 |publisher= [[glbtq.com]]|website=glbtq.com|access-date=7 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html |title=Sagarin bio |publisher=Glbtq.com |date=1913-09-18 |access-date=2009-06-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151656/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html |archive-date=2009-06-06 }}</ref> published his landmark ''The Homosexual in America'', exclaiming, "Society has handed me a mask to wear...Everywhere I go, at all times and before all sections of society, I pretend." Cory was a pseudonym, but his frank and openly subjective descriptions served as a stimulus to the emerging homosexual self-awareness and the nascent [[homophile]] movement.

In the 1960s, [[Frank Kameny]] came to the forefront of the struggle. Having been fired from his job as an astronomer for the Army Map service in 1957 for homosexual behavior, Kameny refused to go quietly. He openly fought his dismissal, eventually appealing it all the way to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. As a vocal leader of the growing movement, Kameny argued for unapologetic public actions. The cornerstone of his conviction was that, "we must instill in the [[LGBT community|homosexual community]] a sense of worth to the individual homosexual", which could only be achieved through campaigns openly led by homosexuals themselves.
With the spread of [[consciousness raising]] (CR) in the late 1960s, coming out became a key strategy of the [[gay liberation]] movement to raise [[political consciousness]] to counter [[heterosexism]] and [[homophobia]]. At the same time and continuing into the 1980s, gay and lesbian [[social support]] discussion groups, some of which were called "coming-out groups", focused on sharing coming-out "stories" (experiences) with the goal of reducing isolation and increasing LGBT visibility and [[Gay pride|pride]].

== Sociolinguistic origin ==
The present-day expression "coming out" is understood to have originated in the early 20th century from an [[analogy]] that likens homosexuals' introduction into [[gay subculture]] to a [[débutante]]'s ''coming-out party.'' This is a celebration for a young [[upper-class]] woman who is making her début&nbsp;– her formal presentation to society&nbsp;– because she has reached adult age or has become eligible for marriage. As historian [[George Chauncey]] points out:
<blockquote>Gay people in the pre-war years [pre-WWI]... did not speak of coming out of what we call the gay closet but rather of coming out ''into'' what they called homosexual society or the gay world, a world neither so small, nor so isolated, nor... so hidden as closet implies.<ref>Chauncey, George (1994). ''Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890–1940''. New York: Basic Books, emphasis added.</ref></blockquote>
In fact, as Elizabeth Kennedy observes, "using the term 'closet' to refer to" previous times such as "the 1920s and 1930s might be [[anachronism|anachronistic]]".<ref>Kennedy, Elizabeth. "'But We Would Never Talk about It': The Structure of Lesbian Discretion in South Dakota, 1928–1933" in ''Inventing Lesbian Cultures in America'', ed. Ellen Lewin (1996). Boston: Beacon Press. p.25 and 214</ref>

An article on coming out<ref name="glbtq.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/coming_out_ssh.html|title=Coming Out, accessed on Aug 31, 2009|access-date=8 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014140942/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/coming_out_ssh.html|archive-date=14 October 2014}}</ref> in the online encyclopedia [[glbtq.com]] states that [[sexologist]] [[Evelyn Hooker]]'s observations introduced the use of "coming out" to the academic community in the 1950s. The article continues by echoing Chauncey's observation that a subsequent shift in [[connotation]] occurred later on. The pre-1950s focus was on ''entrance'' into "a new world of hope and communal solidarity" whereas the post-[[Stonewall Riots]] overtone was an ''exit'' from the oppression of the closet.<ref name="glbtq.com"/> This change in focus suggests that "coming out ''of the closet''" is a [[mixed metaphor]] that joins "coming out" with the [[Coming out#Closeted|closet]] metaphor: an evolution of "[[wikt:skeleton in the closet|skeleton in the closet]]" specifically referring to living a life of denial and secrecy by concealing one's [[sexual orientation]]. The closet metaphor, in turn, is extended to the forces and pressures of heterosexist society and its institutions.

== Identity issues ==
{{See also|Identity (social science)|Personal identity}}

When coming out is described as a gradual process or a journey,<ref name="Coming Out: A Journey"/> it is meant to include becoming aware of and acknowledging one's gender identity, gender expression, or non-hetero-normative sexual orientation or attraction. This preliminary stage, which involves soul-searching or a personal [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imfromdriftwood.com/im-from-new-york-ny-5/|title=Gay Epiphany|access-date=8 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014093757/http://imfromdriftwood.com/im-from-new-york-ny-5/|archive-date=14 October 2014}}</ref> is often called "coming out to oneself" and constitutes the start of [[self-acceptance]]. Many LGBT people say that this stage began for them during [[adolescence]] or [[childhood]], when they first became aware of their sexual orientation toward members of the same sex. Coming out has also been described as a process because of a recurring need or desire to come out in new situations in which LGBT people are assumed to be heterosexual or [[cisgender]], such as at a new job or with new acquaintances. A major frame of reference for those coming out has included using an inside/outside perspective, where some assume that the person can keep their identity or orientation a secret and separate from their outside appearance. This is not as simple as often thought, as Diana Fuss (1991) argues, "the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise the fact that most of us are both inside and outside at the same time".

=== LGBT identity development ===
{{Main|Sexual identity#Models of sexual identity development}}
Every coming out story is the person trying to come to terms with who they are and their sexual orientation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chirrey|first=Deborah|title=I Hereby Come Out: What Sort Of Speech Act Is Coming Out?|journal=Journal of Sociolinguistics|year=2003|volume=7|issue=1|pages=24–37|doi=10.1111/1467-9481.00209}}</ref> Several models have been created to describe coming out as a process for gay and lesbian identity development, e.g. Dank, 1971; Cass, 1984; Coleman, 1989; Troiden, 1989. Of these models, the most widely accepted is the [[Cass identity model]] established by Vivienne Cass.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~linemen/articles/genderidentity.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325110617/http://www.uvm.edu/~linemen/articles/genderidentity.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-25 }}</ref> This model outlines six discrete stages transited by individuals who successfully come out: identity confusion, identity comparison, identity tolerance, identity acceptance, identity pride, and identity synthesis. However, not every LGBT person follows such a model. For example, some LGBT youth become aware of and accept their same-sex desires or gender identity at puberty in a way similar to which heterosexual teens become aware of their sexuality, i.e. free of any notion of difference, stigma or shame in terms of the gender of the people to whom they are attracted. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Regardless of whether LGBT youth develop their identity based on a model, the typical age at which youth in the United States come out has been dropping.

Emerging research suggests that gay men from religious backgrounds are likely to come out online via Facebook and Blogs as it offers a protective interpersonal distance. This largely contradicts the growing movement in social media research indicating that online use, particularly Facebook, can lead to negative mental health outcomes such as increased levels of anxiety. While further research is needed to assess whether these results generalize to a larger sample, these recent findings open the door to the possibility that gay men's online experiences may differ from heterosexuals' in that it may be more likely to provide mental health benefits than consequences.<ref>Etengoff, C. & Daiute, C.

The internet can play a significant role in the coming out process for transgender people. Some come out in an [[online identity]] first, providing an opportunity to go through experiences virtually and safely before risking social sanctions in the real world.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Marciano |first=A. |year=2014 |title=Living the VirtuReal: Negotiating transgender identity in cyberspace |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=824–838 |doi=10.1111/jcc4.12081|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name="Stitt">{{Cite book|title=ACT For Gender Identity: The Comprehensive Guide |last=Stitt|first=Alex|date=2020|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1785927997|location=London|oclc=1089850112}}</ref> However, while many trans people find support online that they may not have in real life, others encounter bullying and harassment when coming out online.

This further shows the barriers that trans individuals can have when coming out.

Coming out as transgender can be more complex than coming out as a sexual minority. Visible changes that can occur as part of changing one's gender identity{{Snd}}such as wardrobe changes, gender reassignment surgery, and name changes{{Snd}}can make coming out to other people less of a choice. Further, things that accompany a change in gender can have financial, physical, medical, and legal implications. Additionally, transgender individuals can experience prejudice and rejection from sexual minorities and others in the LGBT community, in addition to the larger LGBT bias they can face from mainstream culture, which can feel isolating.<ref name="Stitt"/>

== Legal issues ==
{{Further|LGBT rights by country or territory}}

In areas of the world where homosexual acts are penalized or prohibited, gay men, lesbians, and bisexual people can suffer negative legal consequences for coming out. In particular, where homosexuality is a crime, coming out may constitute [[self-incrimination]]. These laws still exist in 76 countries worldwide, including Egypt, Iran, Singapore, and Afghanistan.

People who decide to come out as non-binary or transgender often face more varied and different issues from a legal standpoint. Worldwide, legally changing your documented gender or name based on your identity is often prohibited or extremely difficult.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/publications/license-be-yourself|title=The Best Ways to Achieve Trans Equality|website=www.opensocietyfoundations.org|access-date=2019-11-20}}</ref> A major negative effect of the inequality in regulations comes in the form of mental effects, as transgender people who have to legally announce a gender they do not identify with or their [[dead name]] can face uncomfortable situations and stress.

== Effects ==
In the early stages of the LGBT identity development process, people can feel confused and experience turmoil. In 1993, [[Michelangelo Signorile]] wrote ''[[Queer in America]]'', in which he explored the harm caused both to a closeted person and to society in general by being closeted.<ref>re-released in 2003 by University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|0-299-19374-8}}</ref>

Because LGBT people have historically been marginalized as [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]], coming out of the closet remains a challenge for most of the world's LGBT population and can lead to a [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] of heterosexist [[discrimination]] and [[Violence against LGBT people|homophobic violence]].

A number of studies have been done on the effect of people coming out to their parents. A 1989 report by Robinson et al. of parents of out gay and lesbian children in the United States found that 21% of fathers and 28% of mothers had suspected that their child was gay or lesbian, largely based on gender atypical behaviour during childhood.

Homelessness is a common effect among LGBT youth during the coming out process. LGBT youth are among the largest population of homeless youth; this has typically been caused by the self-identification and acknowledgment of being gay or identifying with the LGBT community.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Tierney|first1=William G.|last2=Ward|first2=James Dean|date=December 2017|title=Coming Out and Leaving Home: A Policy and Research Agenda for LGBT Homeless Students|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=46|issue=9|pages=498–507|doi=10.3102/0013189x17733964|s2cid=148753736|issn=0013-189X}}</ref> About 20% to 30% of homeless youth identify as LGBT.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Kyu|first1=Choi, Soon|last2=DM|first2=Wilson, Bianca|last3=Jama|first3=Shelton|last4=J|first4=Gates, Gary|date=2015-06-01|title=Serving Our Youth 2015: The Needs and Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Youth Experiencing Homelessness|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1pd9886n}}</ref> 55% of LGBQ and 67% of transgender youth are forced out of their homes by their parents or run away because of their sexual orientation or gender identity and expression.<ref name=":0" /> Homelessness among LGBT youth also impacts many areas of an individual's life, leading to higher rates of victimization, depression, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, risky sexual behavior, and participation in more illegal and dangerous activities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reck|first=Jen|date=2009-07-20|title=Homeless Gay and Transgender Youth of Color in San Francisco: "No One Likes Street Kids"—Even in the Castro|journal=Journal of LGBT Youth|volume=6|issue=2–3|pages=223–242|doi=10.1080/19361650903013519|s2cid=143765694|issn=1936-1653}}</ref> A 2016 study on homelessness pathways among Latino LGBT youth found that homelessness among LGBT individuals can also be attributed to structural issues like systems of care and sociocultural and economic factors.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Castellanos|first=H.

Jimmie Manning performed a study in 2015 on positive and negative behavior performed during the coming out conversation. During his study, he learned that almost all of his participants would only attribute negative behaviors with themselves during the coming out conversations and positive behaviors with the recipient of the conversation. Manning suggests further research into this to figure out a way for positive behaviors to be seen and performed equally by both the recipient and the individual coming out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Manning|first1=Jimmie|title=Positive and Negative Communicative Behaviors in Coming-out Conversations|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=2015|volume=62|issue=1|pages=61–97|doi=10.1080/00918369.2014.957127|pmid=25153806|s2cid=11388612}}</ref>

== In/out metaphors ==

=== Dichotomy ===
The closet narrative sets up an implicit dualism between being "in" or being "out" wherein those who are "in" are often stigmatized as living false, unhappy lives.<ref>Seidman, Meeks, and Traschen (1999)</ref> Likewise, philosopher and critical analyst [[Judith Butler]] (1991) states that the ''in/out'' metaphor creates a binary opposition which pretends that the closet is dark, marginal, and false and that being out in the "light of illumination" reveals a true (or essential) identity. Nonetheless, Butler is willing to appear at events as a lesbian and maintains that "it is possible to argue that...there remains a political imperative to use these necessary errors or [[category mistake]]s...to rally and represent an oppressed political constituency".

=== Criticisms ===
In addition Diana Fuss (1991) explains, "the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise the fact that most of us are both inside and outside at the same time". Further, "To be out, in common gay parlance, is precisely to be no longer out; to be out is to be finally outside of exteriority and all the exclusions and deprivations such outsiderhood imposes. Or, put another way, to be out is really to be in—inside the realm of the visible, the speakable, the culturally intelligible." In other words, coming out constructs the closet it supposedly destroys and the self it supposedly reveals, "the first appearance of the homosexual as a 'species' rather than a 'temporary aberration' also marks the moment of the homosexual's disappearance—into the closet".

Furthermore, Seidman, Meeks, and Traschen (1999) argue that "the closet" may be becoming an antiquated metaphor in the lives of modern-day Americans for two reasons.
# Homosexuality is becoming increasingly normalized and the shame and secrecy often associated with it appears to be in decline.
# The metaphor of the closet hinges upon the notion that [[stigma management]] is a way of life.  However, stigma management may actually be increasingly done situationally.

This day was the inspiration for holding [[LGBT History Month]] in the United States in October. The day was founded in 1988, by Robert Eichberg, his partner William Gamble, and [[Jean O'Leary]] to celebrate the [[Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] one year earlier, in which 500,000 people marched on [[Washington, DC]], United States, for gay and lesbian equality. In the United States, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] manages the event under the National Coming Out Project, offering resources to LGBT individuals, couples, parents, and children, as well as straight friends and relatives, to promote awareness of [[LGBT parenting|LGBT families]] living honest and open lives. [[Candace Gingrich]] became the spokesperson for the day in April 1995. Although still named "''National'' Coming Out Day", it is observed in Canada, Germany, The Netherlands, and Switzerland also on October 11, and in the [[United Kingdom]] on 12 October. To celebrate National Coming Out Day on October 11, 2002, Human Rights Campaign released an album bearing the same title as that year's theme: ''[[Being Out Rocks]]''. Participating artists include [[Kevin Aviance]], [[Janis Ian]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], and [[Rufus Wainwright]].

====Journalists====
In August 2019, a sportswriter and broadcaster contributing at ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[ESPN]]'' came out, informing that she is now Nicky Bandini and was previously writing under the name Paolo Bandini. The football journalist highlighted through a [[Twitter]] video and an accompanying article on ''The Guardian'' that it took her several years to come out as transgender publicly. Bandini also went through [[gender dysphoria]] for three-and-a-half decades before finally admitting it to the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/16/im-nicky-bandini-and-im-still-a-sports-writer|title=I'm Nicky Bandini – and I'm still a sports writer|access-date=16 August 2019|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

=== Depictions of coming out ===
{{see also|:Category:LGBT-related coming-of-age films}}

In 1996, the acclaimed British film ''[[Beautiful Thing (film)|Beautiful Thing]]'' had a positive take in its depiction of two teenage boys coming to terms with their sexual identity. In 1987, a two-part episode of the [[Quebec]] television series ''[[Avec un grand A]]'', "Lise, Pierre et Marcel", depicted a married closeted man who has to come out when his wife discovers that he has been having an affair with another man. In the [[Emmy Award]]-nominated episode "[[Gay Witch Hunt]]" of ''[[The Office (U.S.)|The Office]]'', Michael inadvertently outs Oscar to the whole office.

Author Rodger Streitmatter described [[Ellen DeGeneres]]'s coming out in the media as well as an episode of ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', "[[The Puppy Episode]]", as "rank[ing], hands down, as the single most public exit in gay history", changing media portrayals of [[lesbian]]s in Western culture.<ref>Streitmatter, Rodger (2009). From 'Perverts' to 'Fab Five': The Media's Changing Depiction of Gay Men and Lesbians, Routledge. {{ISBN|0-7890-3670-3}}; p. 104.</ref> In 1999, [[Russell T Davies]]'s [[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|''Queer as Folk'']], a popular TV series shown on Channel 4 (UK) debuted and focused primarily on the lives of young gay men; in particular on a 15-year-old going through the processes of revealing his sexuality to those around him. This storyline was also featured prominently in the U.S. version of ''Queer as Folk'', which debuted in 2000.

The television show ''[[The L Word]]'', which debuted in 2004, focuses on the lives of a group of lesbian and bisexual women, and the theme of coming out is prominently featured in the storylines of multiple characters.

''[[Coming Out Serie|Coming Out]]'', which debuted in 2013, is the first [[Quebec]] television program about being gay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info-culture.biz/2013/04/02/coming-out-premiere-serie-web-sur-lunivers-gai-quebecois/|title=Coming out – Première série web sur l'univers gai québécois|work=Info-Culture.biz|access-date=8 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014184911/http://info-culture.biz/2013/04/02/coming-out-premiere-serie-web-sur-lunivers-gai-quebecois/|archive-date=14 October 2014|date=2013-04-02}}</ref>

The third season of the Norwegian teen drama series ''[[Skam (TV series)|SKAM]]'' focused on a main character coming out and his relationship with another boy.

The film ''[[Love, Simon]]'', based on the book ''[[Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda]]'', debuted in 2018 and is the first major studio film about a gay teenager coming out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/love-simon-review|title=Love, Simon Is a Charming Gay Studio Movie That Makes Us Hungry for More|last=Lawson|first=Richard|work=HWD|access-date=2018-03-14|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329221724/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/love-simon-review|archive-date=2018-03-29}}</ref>

== Extended use in LGBT media, publishing and activism ==
"Out" is a common word or prefix used in the titles of LGBT-themed books, films, periodicals, organizations, and TV programs. Some high-profile examples are [[Out (magazine)|Out Magazine]], the defunct [[OutWeek|OutWeek Magazine]], and [[OutTV (Canada)|OutTV]].

== Non-LGBT applications ==
In political, casual, or even humorous contexts, "coming out" means by extension the self-disclosure of a person's secret behaviors, beliefs, affiliations, tastes, identities, and interests that may cause astonishment or bring [[shame]]. Some examples include: "coming out as an alcoholic",<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/nov/03/weekend7.weekend6 |title=The show must go on |newspaper=Guardian |date=2001-11-03 |access-date=2009-06-24 |location=London |first=Louis |last=Theroux |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224171957/http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/nov/03/weekend7.weekend6 |archive-date=2013-12-24 }}</ref> "[[Coming out (BDSM)|coming out as a BDSM participant]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clarissethorn.com/2009/02/16/coming-out-bdsm-upsides-and-downsides/|title=Coming out BDSM: upsides and downsides|work=Clarisse Thorn|access-date=8 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006104323/http://clarissethorn.com/2009/02/16/coming-out-bdsm-upsides-and-downsides/|archive-date=6 October 2014}}</ref> "coming out of the broom closet" (as a [[witchcraft|witch]]),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2090966/ |title=How do I tell my family I'm a Wiccan? |publisher=Slate.com |date=2003-12-04 |access-date=2009-06-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610151212/http://www.slate.com/id/2090966/ |archive-date=2009-06-10 }}</ref>  "coming out as a conservative",<ref>[http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040203-103504-2926r.htm Coming-out day for conservatives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206100727/http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040203-103504-2926r.htm |date=February 6, 2007 }}</ref> "coming out as disabled",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/15528|title=Coming out as disabled - Ekklesia|work=ekklesia.co.uk|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627142409/http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/15528|archive-date=2015-06-27|date=2011-10-10|access-date=2015-01-22}}</ref> "coming out as a liberal",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newhampshirelakesandmountains.com/pdf/BAY.2012.08.30.pdf |title=Layout 1 (Page A1) |access-date=2017-09-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102092533/http://www.newhampshirelakesandmountains.com/pdf/BAY.2012.08.30.pdf |archive-date=2014-11-02 }}</ref> "coming out as [[intersex]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/la-radio-host-who-came-out-intersex-and-why-no-one-gossiped180713|title=The LA radio host who came out as intersex and why no one gossiped|work=Gay Star News|access-date=8 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013081549/http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/la-radio-host-who-came-out-intersex-and-why-no-one-gossiped180713|archive-date=13 October 2014|date=2013-07-18}}</ref> "coming out as [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2multiples.com/compd/ |title=COMPD&nbsp;– Introduction |publisher=2multiples.com |access-date=2009-06-24 }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> "coming out as [[polyamory|polyamorous]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.nationalreview.com/article/380609/polyamorists-come-out-closet-celina-durgin|title=Polyamorists Come Out of the Closet - National Review Online|work=National Review Online|access-date=8 October 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006085106/http://m.nationalreview.com/article/380609/polyamorists-come-out-closet-celina-durgin|archive-date=6 October 2014|date=2014-06-18}}</ref> "coming out as a [[sex work]]er",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xojane.com/issues/coming-out-of-the-hooker-closet|title=What It's Like to Come Out of the Hooker Closet|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014095839/http://www.xojane.com/issues/coming-out-of-the-hooker-closet|archive-date=2014-10-14|access-date=2018-12-09}}</ref> and "coming out of the shadows" as an [[Illegal immigrant population of the United States|undocumented immigrant]] within the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Corrunker|first=Laura|date=2012-01-01|title="Coming Out of the Shadows": DREAM Act Activism in the Context of Global Anti-Deportation Activism|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480726|journal=Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies|volume=19|issue=1|pages=143–168|issn=1543-0367|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919195021/https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480726|archive-date=2016-09-19|doi=10.2979/indjglolegstu.19.1.143|s2cid=154084010}}</ref> The term is also used by members of online [[body integrity dysphoria]] communities to refer to the process of telling friends and families about their condition.
