'''Glasgow Govan''' was a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of the [[Scottish Parliament]] ([[Scottish Parliament Building|Holyrood]]). It elected one [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP)]] by the [[First past the post|plurality (first past the post)]] method of election.

For the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 election]], the constituency was abolished. The Govan electoral ward was divided between [[Glasgow Pollok (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Pollok]] and [[Glasgow Southside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Southside]].

== Electoral region ==
{{See also|Glasgow Scottish Parliament region}}
The region covers the [[Glasgow City Council|Glasgow City council area]] and a north-western portion of the [[South Lanarkshire|South Lanarkshire council area]].

== Constituency boundaries and council areas ==

The Glasgow Govan constituency was created at the same time as the Scottish Parliament, in [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|1999]], with the name and boundaries of an  existing [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster constituency]]. In [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], however, Scottish Westminster ([[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]]) constituencies were mostly replaced with new constituencies.

The Holyrood constituency covers a western portion of the Glasgow City council and small western portion of Renfrewshire Council.<ref>See [http://www.bcomm-scotland.gov.uk/ ''The 5th Periodical Report of the Boundary Commission for Scotland] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921124603/http://www.bcomm-scotland.gov.uk/ |date=September 21, 2007 }}''</ref>

Glasgow Govan is south of the Kelvin constituency, west of Shettleston and north of Cathcart and Pollok, which are all entirely within the city area.

== Boundary review ==
{{See also|Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions from 2011}}

Following the First Periodic review into constituencies of the Scottish Parliament for the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|2011 election]], the Boundary Commission for Scotland recommended the abolition of the Glasgow Govan constituency. The seat created is known as ''[[Glasgow Southside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Southside]]'' formed by the combination of Southside Central, and Pollokshields wards with the addition of the eastern half of the Govan division.

== Member of the Scottish Parliament ==

The First Minister, [[Nicola Sturgeon]], represented the constituency from the 2007 election. She was previously an MSP for the Glasgow regional list from 1999 to 2007, during which time she was Leader of the Opposition at Holyrood from 2004 to 2007.
