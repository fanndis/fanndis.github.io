The '''lieutenant governor of British Columbia''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɛ|f|ˈ|t|ɛ|n|ə|n|t}}) is the [[Viceroy|viceregal]] representative of the {{Canadian monarch, current}}, in the province of [[British Columbia]], Canada.  The office of [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]] is an office of [[the Crown]] and serves as a representative of the [[Monarchy in the Canadian provinces|monarchy in the province]], rather than the [[Governor General of Canada|governor general of Canada]]. The office was created in 1871 when the [[Colony of British Columbia (1866–1871)|Colony of British Columbia]] joined the [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]]. Since then the lieutenant governor has been the representative of the [[monarchy in British Columbia]]. Previously, between 1858 and 1863 under colonial administration  the title of lieutenant governor of British Columbia was given to [[Richard Clement Moody]] as commander of the [[Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment]]. This position coexisted with the office of governor of British Columbia served by [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] during that time.

The lieutenant governor of British Columbia is appointed in the same manner as the other provincial viceroys in Canada and is similarly tasked with carrying out most of the monarch's constitutional and ceremonial duties.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Victoria| author-link=Victoria of the United Kingdom| publication-date=29 March 1867| title=Constitution Act, 1867| series=V.58| publication-place=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ca_1867.html| accessdate=15 January 2009}}</ref> The present, and 30th, lieutenant governor of British Columbia is [[Janet Austin]], who has served in the role since 24 April 2018.

==Role and presence==
{{further|Lieutenant governor (Canada)}}
The lieutenant governor of British Columbia is vested with [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)#Constitutional role|a number of governmental duties]]. One such task unique to the lieutenant governor of British Columbia is authenticating with the Great Seal of British Columbia [[Notary|notarized]] documents to be used outside of the province. However, the issuance of a Certificate of Authentication only means the signature of the notary public matched the ones on file and not the authenticity or truthfulness of the texts themselves.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.legaltree.ca/node/691| title=The use of notarial seals by lawyers in British Columbia| publisher=Legal Tree Project Inc.| accessdate=28 June 2009}}</ref> Because Canada is not a signatory state to the [[Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents]], this procedure is simply called authentication instead of [[apostille]].

At these events, the lieutenant governor's presence is marked by the [[Flags of the Lieutenant Governors of Canada|lieutenant governor's standard]], consisting of a blue field bearing the escutcheon of the [[Coat of arms of British Columbia|Arms of {{ucfirst:{{Canadian monarch, current|genderp=~}}}} Majesty in Right of British Columbia]], surmounted by a crown and surrounded by ten gold maple leaves, symbolizing the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces of Canada]]. Within British Columbia, the lieutenant governor also follows only the sovereign in the [[Order of precedence in British Columbia|province's order of precedence]], preceding even other members of the [[Monarchy of Canada#Canadian Royal Family|Canadian Royal Family]] and the Queen's federal representative, the [[governor general of Canada]].

==History==
{{Further|List of lieutenant governors of British Columbia}}
[[File:Joseph Trutch.jpg|thumb|First lieutenant governor of the Province of British Columbia, Sir Joseph William Trutch KCMG, 1871-1876]]

The first British settlement in the area was the [[Colony of British Columbia (1858–66)]], of which the first lieutenant governor, from 1858 to 1863, was [[Richard Clement Moody]], who had previously served as the first [[governor of the Falkland Islands]]. Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of [[British Columbia]] – [[New Westminster]] – and established the [[Cariboo Road]] and [[Stanley Park]]. He named [[Burnaby Lake]] after his private secretary [[Robert Burnaby]] and named Port Coquitlam's {{convert|400|ft|m|adj=on}} "Mary Hill" after his wife Mary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalengineers.ca/MoodyPostScript.html|title=Col. Richard Clement Moody -- Postscript|accessdate=4 July 2016}}</ref> [[Port Moody]] is named after him.

This colony of British Columbia was amalgamated with the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]] to form the [[Colony of British Columbia (1866–71)]], which was succeeded by the present-day province of British Columbia following the [[Canadian Confederation]] of 1871, when the present office of the lieutenant governor of British Columbia came into being.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Victoria| author-link=Victoria of the United Kingdom| publication-date=16 May 1871| title=British Columbia Terms of Union| series=10| publication-place=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/bctu.html| accessdate=16 June 2009}}</ref>

Since 1871, 28 lieutenant governors have served the province, amongst whom were notable firsts, such as [[David Lam (real estate entrepreneur)|David Lam]]—the first [[Asian-Canadian]] lieutenant governor in Canada—and [[Iona Campagnolo]]—the first female lieutenant governor of British Columbia. The shortest mandate by a lieutenant governor of British Columbia was [[Edward Gawler Prior]], from 1919 to his death in 1920, while the longest was [[George Pearkes]], from October 1960 to July 1968.

In 1903, before [[political party|political parties]] were a part of [[Politics of British Columbia|British Columbia politics]], Lieutenant Governor [[Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière]] was the last lieutenant governor in Canada to dismiss from office an incumbent [[premier]], [[Edward Gawler Prior]]; Prior had been found to have given an important construction contract to his own hardware business,<ref>{{Cite book| contribution=Edward Gawler Prior| title=The Encyclopedia of British Columbia| editor-last=Francis| editor-first=Daniel| place=Vancouver| publisher=Harbour Publishing}}</ref> though he was later appointed as lieutenant governor himself. In 1952, the lieutenant governor was, without a clear majority in the Legislature following the [[1952 British Columbia general election|general election]], required to exercise his personal judgement in selecting his [[Premier of British Columbia|premier]]. Though the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) (now the [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|New Democratic Party]]) held one fewer seat than the [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit Party]] (SoCred), Lieutenant Governor [[Clarence Wallace]] was under pressure to call on the CCF leader to form the new Cabinet;<ref>{{cite book| last=Mitchell| first=David J.| author-link=David J.

Bennett]], which resulted in the start of a twenty-year dynasty for the latter.
