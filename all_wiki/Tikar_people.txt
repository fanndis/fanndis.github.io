The '''Tikar''' is a blanket term used for several [[ethnic groups in Cameroon]]. It has been used widely for different peoples and their culture.

There is a single ethnic group called the Tikar who live in on the Tikar Plain in [[Adamawa Region]]. They speak a [[Bantoid language]] called [[Tikar language|Tikar]]. Their population is approximately 25,000. The [[Bedzan people|Bedzan]] pygmies (who also live on the Tikar Plain) share their language. The main Tikar towns are [[Bankim]], [[Ngambè-Tikar|Ngambe Tikar]], and [[Magba]].

The Tikar have elements of [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] and [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] descent. Their folk belief states that during pregnancy the blood that the woman would normally release during [[menstruation]] forms parts of the fetus. This blood is said to form the skin, blood, flesh and most of the organs. The bones, brain, heart and teeth are believed to be formed from the father's [[sperm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/Rainforest/SML_files/Pricede/descent_1.html |title=descent/graphics - Page 1 |publisher=Lucy.ukc.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref> In the case of a son, the masculinity also comes from this. The Tikar are also noted as mask-makers.

Quite different from these Tikar are many groups in the northwestern part of the country, in the [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest Region]] near the [[Nigeria]]n border whose royal families trace links to the Tikar royal family. Examples are the [[Nso people|Nso']] and the Wimbum from the North West as well as the [[Bamum people|Bamoun]] (from [[West Region (Cameroon)|West Region]]) whose languages are different from Tikar. Although it is common to see statements such as the "Nso' are Tikar" or the Wimbum came from Tikari, that really should ''not'' be taken to be a statement about the culture, languages etc. of most of the people of that ethnicity.

On the 2006 PBS television program ''[[African American Lives]]'', the musician [[Quincy Jones]] had his [[DNA]] tested; the test showed him to be of Tikar descent. In the PBS television program ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', former [[Secretary of State of the United States of America|Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] learned she shared maternal heritage with the Tikar. Producer/Musician [[Flying Lotus]] is also descended from the Tikar.<ref>{{cite web|title=Video: Flying Lotus Learns About His African Roots|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/video-flying-lotus-learns-about-his-african-roots|website=Complex|accessdate=January 27, 2018|date=February 5, 2013}}</ref> However, there is no clarity about what sort of Tikar (as distinguished above) these test are identifying.
