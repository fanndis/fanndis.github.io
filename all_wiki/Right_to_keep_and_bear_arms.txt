==Background==

The [[Bill of Rights 1689]] allowed [[Protestantism|Protestant]] citizens of [[England]] to "have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law" and restricted the ability of the [[English Crown]] to have a [[standing army]] or to interfere with Protestants' right to bear arms "when Papists were both Armed and Imployed contrary to Law" and established that Parliament, not the Crown, could regulate the right to bear arms.<ref name="c21WillMarSess2">{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/WillandMarSess2/1/2/introduction |title=1688 c.2 1 Will. and Mar.

Sir [[William Blackstone]] wrote in the 18th century that the right to have arms was auxiliary to the "natural right of resistance and self-preservation" subject to suitability and allowance by law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp |title=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref> The term ''arms'', as used in the 1600s, refers to the process of equipping for war.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|title=arm (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=arm&allowed_in_frame=0|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=12 March 2015}}</ref> It is commonly used as a synonym for weapon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arm|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/arm|website=Thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=12 March 2015}}</ref>

Inclusion of this right in a written constitution is uncommon. In 1875, 17 percent of constitutions included a right to bear arms. Since the early twentieth century, "the proportion has been less than 9 percent and falling".<ref name=Ginsburg>{{cite news |last1=Ginsburg |first1=Tom |last2=Elkins |first2=Zachary |last3=Melton |first3=James |title=U.S. Gun Rights Are Truly American Exceptionalism |work=Bloomberg |date=7 March 2013 |accessdate=25 March 2016 |url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-03-07/u-s-gun-rights-truly-are-american-exceptionalism}}</ref> In an article titled "U.S. Gun Rights Truly Are American Exceptionalism," a historical survey and comparative analysis of constitutions dating back to 1789,<ref name=Ginsburg/> [[Tom Ginsburg]] and colleagues "identified only 15 constitutions (in nine countries) that had ever included an explicit right to bear arms.

Mexican constitution of 1857 first included right to be armed. In its first version, the right was defined in similar terms as it is in the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. A new Mexican constitution of 1917 relativized the right, stating that its utilization must be in line with local police regulations.

Another change was included in 1971 Constitution. Since then, Mexicans have the right to be armed only within their home and further utilization of this right is subject to [[Gun politics in Mexico|statutory authorization in Federal law]].

Generally, where modern constitutions refer to arms at all, the purpose is "to allow the government to regulate their use or to compel military service, not to provide a right to bear them".<ref name=Ginsburg/> Constitutions which historically guaranteed a right to bear arms are those of [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Liberia]], [[Mexico]], [[Nicaragua]] and the [[United States|United States of America]].<ref name="CCP">{{cite web|url=http://comparativeconstitutionsproject.org/wp-content/uploads/arms-1200w-e1379117382415.png?6c8912|title=Data Visualizations – Right to Bear Arms|last1=Ginsburg|first1=Tom|last2=Elkins|first2=Zachary|date=2016|publisher=CCP: Comparative Constitutions Project|last3=Melton|first3=James}}</ref> Nearly all of the Latin American examples were modeled on that of the United States.<ref name=Elkins/> At present, out of the world's nearly 200 constitutions, three still include a right to bear arms: Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States; of these three, only that of the United States does not include explicit restrictive conditions.

This ruling was overturned in 2008, as a result of the case of [[District of Columbia v. Heller]] and, two years later, [[McDonald v.

Historically, the [[Czech Crown lands|Czech lands]] were at the forefront of the spreading of civilian firearms ownership.<ref name="zrizeni" /> In the 1420s and 1430s, firearms became indispensable tools for the mostly peasant [[Hussite wars|Hussite armies]], whose amateur combatants, including women, fended off a series of invasions of professional crusader armies of well-armored warriors with cold weapons.<ref name="zrizeni" /> Throughout and after the Hussite wars, firearms design underwent fast development and their possession by civilians became a matter of course. First firearms regulation was enacted in 1517 as a part of general accord between the nobles and burghers and later in 1524 as a standalone Enactment on Firearms (''zřízení o ručnicích''). The 1517 law explicitly stated that "'''all people of all standing have the right to keep firearms at home'''" while at the same time enacting a universal carry ban.<ref name="zrizeni" /> The 1524 enactment set out a process of issuing of permits for carrying of firearms and detailed enforcement and punishment for carrying without such a permit.<ref name="zrizeni">{{cite web

Since its inception during the Hussite revolution, the right to keep firearms endured over five-hundred years until the Nazi gun ban during the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]] in the 20th century. Firearms possession later became subject to government permission during the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–89)|communist dictatorship]] with only those deemed loyal to the communist party being able to be armed. After [[Velvet revolution|return of liberty]], the Czech Republic instated shall issue permitting process, under which all residents can keep and bear arms subject to fulfillment of regulatory conditions.<ref name="zrizeni" />

Since 1953, it has been a criminal offence in the United Kingdom to carry a knife (with the exception of non-locking folding knives with a cutting edge of 3 inches (7.62 centimetres) or less) or any "[[offensive weapon]]" in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. The cutting edge of a knife is separate to the blade length.

Furthermore, the law does not allow an offensive weapon or ordinary item intended or adapted as an offensive weapon to be carried in public before the threat of violence arises. This would only be acceptable in the eyes of the law if the person armed themselves immediately preceding or during an attack (in a public place). This is known as a "[[weapon of opportunity]]" or "instantaneous arming".<ref name="cps.gov.uk"/>

The United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) has made comparisons between countries with different levels of gun ownership and investigated the correlation between gun ownership levels and gun homicides, and between gun ownership levels and gun suicides. A strong correlation is seen in both.

<blockquote>
During the 1989 and 1992 International Crime Surveys, data on gun ownership in eighteen countries have been collected on which WHO data on suicide and homicide committed with guns and other means are also available. The results presented in a previous paper based on the fourteen countries surveyed during the first ICS and on rank correlations (Spearman's rho), suggested that gun ownership may increase suicides and homicides using firearms, while it may not reduce suicides and homicides with other means. In the present analysis, four additional countries covered by the 1992 ICS only have been included, and Pearson's correlation coefficients r have been used. The results confirm those presented in the previous study.<ref>{{cite book |last=Killias |first=Martin |year=1993 |chapter=Gun Ownership, Suicide and Homicide: An International Perspective |editor1-first=Anna |editor1-last=Alvazzi del Frate |editor2-first=Ugljesa |editor2-last=Zvekic |editor3-first=Jan J.

UNICRI also investigated the relationship between gun ownership levels and other forms of homicide or suicide to determine whether high gun ownership added to or merely displaced other forms of homicide or suicide. They reported that "widespread gun ownership has not been found to reduce the likelihood of fatal events committed with other means. Thus, people do not turn to knives and other potentially lethal instruments less often when more guns are available, but more guns usually means more victims of suicide and homicide." Speculating on possible causes the researchers concluded that "all we know is that guns do not reduce fatal events due to other means, but that they go along with more shootings. Although we do not know why exactly this is so, we have a good reason to suspect guns to play a—fatal—role in this".<ref name="UNICRI">{{cite book |last=Killias |first=Martin |year=1993 |chapter=Gun Ownership, Suicide and Homicide: An International Perspective |editor1-first=Anna |editor1-last=Alvazzi del Frate |editor2-first=Ugljesa |editor2-last=Zvekic |editor3-first=Jan J.

The research reporter found that guns were the major cause of homicides in 3 of the 14 countries it studied; Northern Ireland, Italy, and the United States. Although the data seem to indicate that reducing the availability of one significant type of arms—firearms—leads to reductions both in gun crimes and gun suicides and in overall crimes and overall suicides, the author did caution that "reducing the number of guns in the hands of the private citizen may become a hopeless task beyond a certain point", citing the American example.<ref name="UNICRI"/>

In contrast to the 1993 study however, a more recent study by UNICRI researchers from 2001 examined the link between household gun ownership and overall homicide, overall suicide, as well as gun homicide and gun suicide rates amongst 21 countries. Significant correlations between household gun ownership and rates of gun suicides for both genders, and gun homicide rates involving female victims were found. There were no significant correlations detected for total homicide and suicide rates, as well as gun homicide rates involving male victims.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Killias |first1=M. |last2=van Kesteren |first2=J. |last3=Rindlisbacher |first3=M. |year=2001 |title=Guns, Violent Crime, and Suicide in 21 Countries |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Criminology]] |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=429–448 |url=https://pure.uvt.nl/portal/files/5263789/GunsKilliasvKesteren.pdf }}</ref>Public health critic and gun rights proponent [[Miguel Faria]] writing in [[Surgical Neurology International]] contends that to keep and bear arms have not only constitutional protection but also that firearms have beneficial aspects that have been ignored by the public health establishment in which he played a part; that guns are beneficial in personal self-defense, collective defense, as well as in protecting life and property.<ref name="Faria 1">{{cite journal |last1=Faria |first1=Miguel A. |title=America, guns, and freedom.
