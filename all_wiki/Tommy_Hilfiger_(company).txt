==History==

===Background and founding (1960s–1990s)===
[[Tommy Hilfiger]]’s career in fashion began in 1968, when he co-founded a clothing and record store named People’s Place in [[upstate New York]]. Using $150<ref name="thcorp_r6" /> he had saved from working at a petrol station as startup money,<ref name="thcorp_r6" /> he oversaw the expansion of the company into a chain<ref name="thcorp_s8" /> of ten stores. Despite meeting with initial success,<ref name="thcorp_r6" /> People's Place filed for bankruptcy in 1977.<ref name="thcorp_r6" /> In 1979, Hilfiger moved to [[New York City]] to pursue a career as a fashion designer,<ref name="TCBIO6" /> working on several different labels including [[Jordache]] Jeans.<ref name="thcorp_s8" /><ref name="thbiotwo_gbusinessofashion" />

In the early 1980s, he met [[Mohan Murjani]], an Indian textile magnate hoping to launch a line of men’s clothing. With Murjani’s backing<ref name="thcorp_s8" /> in 1985, Hilfiger debuted his first signature collection,<ref name="thbiotwo_fbiography.com" /> which featured modernized versions of [[button-down shirt]]s, [[chinos]], and other classic [[preppy]] styles. The casual and youthful attitude of these first designs would remain a trait of the company's later collections.<ref name="thcorp_n1" /> The new clothing line made its debut with a high-profile marketing campaign, which included a large billboard in [[Times Square]]<ref name="thbiotwo_fbiography.com" /> by advertiser [[George Lois]].<ref name="TCBIO20" />

The Tommy Hilfiger brand left Murjani International in 1989, with [[Silas Chou]] instead providing financial backing.<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank" /> That year, [[Lawrence Stroll]] and Joel Horowitz, both former executives of [[Ralph Lauren]], were hired as executives of the newly formed company Tommy Hilfiger, Inc., which had an initial focus on casual male [[sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]].<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank" />

===Growth of popularity and product lines (1990s)===

[[File:TommyHilfigerGlasses.JPG|thumb|left|Tommy Hilfiger designer glasses]]
The Tommy Hilfiger Corporation went [[initial public offering|public]] in 1992.<ref name="thcorp_s8"/> After licensing [[Pepe Jeans|Pepe Jeans USA]] in 1995, in 1996 Tommy Hilfiger Inc. began distributing women's clothing as well.<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank"/> By the end of the next year Hilfiger had opened his first store in [[Beverly Hills]], which was followed by a store in London in 1998.<ref name="thbiotwo_ijrank"/> The company launched its bed and bath line in 1998.<ref name="thcorp_s8"/>

Throughout the 1990s the company's marketing division worked in tandem with the [[popular music]] industry, and as early as 1993 Hilfiger was an official sponsor for [[Pete Townshend]]'s [[Psychoderelict]] tour. In the early 1990s a baggier, less tailored menswear look came into fashion, and Hilfiger gave his clothes a more relaxed fit.<ref name="thcorp_t11"/> As roomier styles with oversized logos became popular with hip-hop artists in the mid-to-late 1990s,<ref name="thcorp_u12"/> Hilfiger's style of clothing became both increasingly popular with the American "[[preppy]]" scene and as [[hip hop fashion]],<ref name="thbiotwo_fbiography.com"/> and when [[Snoop Dogg]] wore a Hilfiger [[sweatshirt]] during an appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the 1990s, it sold out of New York City stores the next day.<ref name="vibe282"/> Moreover, Hilfiger courted the new hip hop market, and rappers like [[Sean Combs|Puffy]] and [[Coolio]] walked during his runways shows.<ref name="vibe282"/> With collections often influenced by the fashion of music subcultures, The clothes are also marketed in connection with the music industry,<ref name="TCBIO15"/><ref name="TCBIO16"/> and American [[R&B]] icon [[Aaliyah]] became the much-publicized spokesperson for Tommy Hilfiger Corporation in 1997.<ref name="aaliyahspokes"/> The company would later sponsor [[Sheryl Crow]]'s "[[If It Makes You Happy]]" tour in 1997,<ref name="TCBIO18"/> [[Britney Spears]] 1999 [[...Baby One More Time Tour]],<ref name="tommyannounced"/><ref name="TCBIO17"/> and [[Lenny Kravitz]]'s 1999 Freedom tour.<ref name="TCBIO19"/>

===Overseas growth and Apax Partners acquisition (2000s)===
Women's intimate apparel was introduced in 2001.<ref name="thcorp_s8"/> After sales and net income faltered in 2001,<ref name="thcorp_s8"/> the company's sales in 2002 totaled $1.87 billion.<ref name="thcorp_s8"/> Overall between 2000 and 2009, sales slipped from around $1.9 billion<ref name="thcorp_v13"/> to $700 million.<ref name="thcorp_u12"/> During the same time period, however, Hilfiger’s European sales steadily rose to $1.13 billion. In 2003, Hilfiger executive Fred Gehring and Hilfiger decided to further invest in the brand's growing overseas audience by re-focusing on the brand’s original style, “classic American cool,” and designing the clothes out of [[New York City]].<ref name="thcorp_v13"/> Gehring also adapted the business model to suit European retail culture, pursuing partnerships with European department stores and with smaller boutiques, signing 4,500 of them in 15 countries.<ref name="thcorp_v13"/> Hilfiger also strove to retain the designer brand exclusivity of the Hilfiger label by signing a deal to distribute the best-selling Hilfiger lines at [[Macy's]] only.<ref name="thbiotwo_fbiography.com"/> 
[[File:TommyHilfigerFairviewMall.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tommy Hilfiger storefront inside a mall in 2014]]
Hilfiger has endorsed products such as [[True Star (perfume)|True Star]] is a [[perfume|fragrance]], which was released in 2004 with [[Beyoncé Knowles]] as poster girl.<ref name="truestarperfume"/> True Star would go on to win a [[FiFi Awards|FiFi Award]] for Best New Commercial Fragrance.<ref name="fifiawards2005"/> By 2004, the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation company had revenues of $1.8 approximately billion and 5,400 employees.<ref name="thbiotwo_gbusinessofashion"/> In 2006, Tommy Hilfiger sold Tommy Hilfiger Inc. for $1.6 billion,<ref name="thcorp_o2"/> or $16.80 a share, to [[Apax Partners]], a private investment company.<ref name="apaxfs"/> After the acquisition Gehring assumed control of the American headquarters of Tommy Hilfiger as well as Europe. Gehring and Hilfiger narrowed their focus in the United States to the profitable core sportswear line, and U.S. sales began to rise in 2010.<ref name="thcorp_u12"/>

===Phillips-Van Heusen acquisition and recent years (2010s-20s)===

In March 2010, [[Phillips-Van Heusen]] (PVH Corp.) bought the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation for $3 billion,<ref name="calvinklienovwner"/><ref name="NY Times News"/> in a deal that was nearly seven times what PVH had paid for [[Calvin Klein]] in 2003.<ref name="thcorp_y23"/> Fred Gehring, who launched Hilfiger’s European division in 1996, assumed the role of Hilfiger's CEO.<ref name="thcorp_y23"/> Global sales in retail for the brand in 2013 were US $6.4 billion,<ref name="thcorp_n1"/> and $6.7 billion in 2014.<ref name="thcorp_x19"/> Daniel Grieder was appointed CEO of Tommy Hilfiger Group in July 2014. Former CEO Gehring was made [[executive chairman]] of Tommy Hilfiger Group<ref name="thcorp_p3"/> and was appointed [[vice chairman]] of PVH.<ref name="thcorp_p3"/>

==Worker conditions==

In the late 1990s, Tommy Hilfiger and other large American textile companies such as Calvin Klein and Sears were [[Economy of the Northern Mariana Islands#Textile industry|defendants in a class-action lawsuit]] alleging that luxury clothes were being manufactured in [[sweatshop]] conditions in [[Saipan]]. After a group settlement that admitted no liability, in March 2000, Tommy Hilfiger volunteered to allow independent oversight of their manufacturing on the island.<ref name="globalexchange"/> In March 2012,<ref name="factorie">

In 2014, PVH was consulting about investing in [[Ethiopia]] in relation to Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, with labor rights among the key talking points.<ref name="thecoptwo_exploreind"/> In 2016, the India Committee of the Netherlands (ICN) reported that textile workers in [[Bangalore]] were working in conditions akin to slavery. Clothing companies [[H&M]], [[Inditex]], [[C&A]] and PVH publicly committed to "improving the lives of workers in Bengaluru" after the report, while PVH also announced it would independently investigate and establish new guidelines for its suppliers.<ref name="retirementnyt">

==Marketing and advertising==
In 1985, to help him launch his first collection, Hilfiger hired advertiser and graphic designer [[George Lois]]<ref name="TCBIO20"/> to make a billboard for the center of [[Times Square]] in New York City.<ref name="thbiotwo_fbiography.com"/> Instead of models, the ad featured the initials of three well-known fashion designers—“PE” ([[Perry Ellis]]), “RL” ([[Ralph Lauren]]), “CK” ([[Calvin Klein]]), and announced that “TH” (Tommy Hilfiger) was the next great menswear designer. The billboard created a stir in the fashion press and succeeded in creating awareness of the Hilfiger name.<ref name="thcorp_y23"/> In subsequent years Hilfiger and Lois collaborated again on other ads for the Hilfiger brand. One campaign, in 1990, compared Hilfiger’s American style with other “iconic American” classics, such as the 1955 [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]] and the 1940 [[Harley-Davidson]] bike.<ref name="thcorp_t11"/> Hilfiger courted the new hip hop market in the 1990s,<ref name="vibe282"/> and rappers like [[Sean Combs|Puffy]] and [[Coolio]] walked during its runways shows.<ref name="vibe282"/>

From 2002 to 2006, Tommy Hilfiger owned the naming rights to the [[Tommy Hilfiger at Jones Beach Theatre]] amphitheater on [[Long Island]],<ref name="promocompany"/> one of the more popular music venues in the United States.<ref name="thcorp_s8"/> Starting in 2010, in collaboration with New York advertising firm Laird & Partners, Tommy Hilfiger Corporation launched the advertising campaign “The Hilfigers.” The campaign features a fictional family of Hilfigers wearing the brand's clothing in fun preppy venues. The first campaign, for fall 2010, was a photoset of a college football tailgate, followed by photoshoots at a tennis court, a rustic holiday party, a camping trip, an [[Ivy League]] college, and the beaches of [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. The spring and summer collections of 2015 were displayed at a wedding in [[Sonoma, California]], followed by an American football stadium for fall and winter.<ref name="thcorp_z25"/>{{dead link|date=July 2020}}

The brand created the publicity tour "Prep World” in 2011, which featured specialty pop-up shops in Paris, New York, London, Stockholm, Los Angeles, Madrid, Milan, the German island [[Sylt]], and the [[Belgian]] town of [[Knokke]]. Hilfiger made personal appearances with author and preppy expert [[Lisa Birnbach]], as well as designing a special clothing collection to support the initiative.<ref name="thcorp_z26"/> The brand's 30th anniversary was in 2015, and the company celebrated the occasion with a fashion tour. Among other events, in [[Beijing]] in May 2015 the brand recreated their New York Fashion Week runway show internationally for the first time.<ref name="thcorp_z29"/> The couple [[Olivia Palermo]] and Johannes Huebl were also brought in as guest editors for the summer 2015 women's and men's collections.<ref name="thcorp_x19"/> For the fall of 2015, [[Rafael Nadal]] is the brand ambassador for Tommy Hilfiger underwear and Tommy Hilfiger Tailored collections.<ref name="thcorp_x19"/><ref name="thcorp_z27"/>

[[Zendaya]] is the new global women’s ambassador for the spring of 2019. She will also design a Tommy x Zendaya capsule collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/zendaya-tommy-hilfiger-collaboration|title=Tommy Hilfiger Taps Zendaya For Next Collaboration|publisher=Vogue|accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref>
