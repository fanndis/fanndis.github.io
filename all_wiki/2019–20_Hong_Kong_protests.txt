{{2019–20 Hong Kong protests sidebar}}
{{Chinese democracy movement}}

The ongoing '''2019–20 Hong Kong protests''', also known as '''Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement''', were triggered by the introduction of the [[2019 Hong Kong extradition bill|Fugitive Offenders amendment bill]] by the [[Hong Kong government]]. The now aborted bill would have allowed [[extradition]] to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong did not have extradition agreements, including [[mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]]. This led to concerns that Hong Kong residents and visitors would be exposed to the [[Law of the People's Republic of China|legal system of mainland China]], thereby undermining [[One country, two systems|Hong Kong's autonomy]] and infringing civil liberties. It set off a chain of protest actions that began with a sit-in at the government headquarters on 15 March 2019, a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9&nbsp;June 2019, followed by a gathering outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12&nbsp;June which [[612 Incident|escalated into violence]] that caught the world's attention.

On 16 June, just one day after the Hong Kong government suspended the bill, an even bigger protest took place to push for its complete withdrawal and in reaction to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12&nbsp;June. As the protests progressed, citizens laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into [[Police misconduct allegations during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all the arrested, a retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as "riots", and the resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] as [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|chief executive]] along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] in the territory. Police inaction when suspected [[Triad (organized crime)|triad]] members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21&nbsp;July and the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31&nbsp;August further escalated the protests.

Lam withdrew the bill on 4&nbsp;September, but refused to concede the other four demands. Exactly one month later, she invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance|emergency powers]] to implement an [[anti-mask law]], to counterproductive effect. Confrontations escalated and intensified – police brutality and misconduct allegations increased, while some protesters started using [[petrol bomb]]s and vandalising pro-Beijing establishments and symbols representing the government. Rifts within society widened and activists from both sides assaulted each other. The [[storming of the Legislative Council]] in July 2019, the deaths of [[Death of Chow Tsz-lok|Chow Tsz-lok]] and [[Death of Luo Changqing|Luo Changqing]], the shooting of an unarmed protester, and the sieges of two universities in November 2019 were landmark events.

After the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong conflict|conflict in the Chinese University]] and [[siege of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University|siege of the Polytechnic University]], the unprecedented landslide victory of the [[pro-democracy camp]] in the [[2019 Hong Kong local elections|District Council election]] in November and the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] in early 2020 brought a little respite. Tensions mounted again in May 2020 after Beijing's [[National People's Congress decision on Hong Kong national security legislation|decision to promulgate a national security bill]] for Hong Kong before September. This was seen by many as a threat to fundamental political freedoms and civil liberties ostensibly enshrined in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], and prompted the international community to re-evaluate their policies towards Hong Kong, which they deemed was no longer autonomous.

The approval ratings of the government and the police plunged to the lowest point since the [[handover of Hong Kong|1997 handover]]; the [[Central People's Government]] alleged that foreign powers were instigating the conflict, although the protests have been largely described as "leaderless". The United States passed the [[Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act]] on 27&nbsp;November 2019 to support the protest movement. The [[tactics and methods surrounding the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests|tactics and methods used]] have inspired other protests in 2019.

== Background ==
{{main|Causes of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests}}

===Direct cause===
The [[Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019]] was first proposed by the [[government of Hong Kong]] in February 2019 in response to the 2018 [[murder of Poon Hiu-wing]] by her boyfriend Chan Tong-kai in [[Taiwan]], where the two Hong Kong residents were visiting as tourists. As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the chief executive, to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name="scmp_3004067" />

The inclusion of [[mainland China]] in the amendment is of concern to Hong Kong society: Citizens, academics and the legal profession fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from the legal system administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] would erode the "[[one country, two systems]]" principle in practice since the 1997 handover; furthermore, Hong Kong citizens lack confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissent.<ref name="theconversation118753" /> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other mechanisms, such as an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name="scmp_3004067" /><ref name="scmp_3006463" />

===Underlying causes===
The 2019–20 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014 which begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name="bbc_48655474" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the chief executive of Hong Kong continues to be elected by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name="time_5661211" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the "high degree of autonomy" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the NPCSC saw fit to rule on the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|disqualification of six lawmakers]]; fears over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]] were sparked by the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]].<ref name="bbc_48607723" /><ref name="time_5661211" /> The general trend of the loss of freedoms in Hong Kong is marked by its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s [[Democracy Index]].<ref name="thestandard215668" /><ref name="jm3Nr" /> [[Xi Jinping]]'s accession to paramount leader of China in 2012 marked a more hardline authoritarian approach, most notably with the construction of [[Xinjiang re-education camps|concentration camps in Xinjiang]]. The spectre that Hong Kong may similarly be brought to heel became an important element in the protests.<ref name="caught fire" />

Anti-Mainland sentiment had begun to swell in the 2010s. The daily quota of 150 immigrants from China since 1997, and the massive flows of mainland visitors strained Hong Kong's public services and eroded local culture; mainlanders' arrogance drew the scorn of Hongkongers.<ref name="caught fire" /> The rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] during the tenure of [[CY Leung]] as chief executive was marked by the high-profile campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name="scmp_3021518" /> As fewer and fewer young people in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese nationals, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name="bbc_48607723" /> Scandals and corruption in China shook people's confidence of the country's political systems; the [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 and the Express Rail Link project connecting Hong Kong with mainland cities and the subsequent co-location agreement [[Anti-Hong Kong Express Rail Link movement|proved highly controversial]]. Citizens saw these policies as Beijing's decision to strengthen its hold over Hong Kong. By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name="economist_20190826_almostnobody" />

The polite Umbrella Revolution had provided inspiration and brought about a political awakening to some,<ref name="bbc_48655474" /><ref name="uRWPA" /> but its failure and the subsequent split within the pro-democratic bloc prompted a re-evaluation of strategy and tactics. In the years that followed, the general consensus emerged that peaceful and polite protests were ineffective in advancing democratic development, and became an example of what not to do in further protests. Media noted that protests in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than the optimism in 2014.<ref name="guardian_20190702_moodhardens" /><ref name="cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation" /> The aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill, solidifying around achieving the level of freedom and liberties promised.<ref name="time_20190815_summerunrest" />

Economic factors were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among Hongkongers.<ref name="economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing" /><ref name="aljazeera_190801151538867" /><ref name="cnbc_20190412_averageprice" /> With powerful business cartels, Hong Kong suffers from [[income disparity]]<ref name="disparity" /> – the second highest [[Gini coefficient]] in the world in 2017<ref name="1AkHH" /> – and a shortage of affordable or public housing for the city's population.<ref name="scmp_3020789" /><ref name="scmp_1618427" /> Youth, who have been pre-eminent in the protests, are frustrated by low [[social mobility]] and the lack of job opportunities;<ref name="disparity" /><ref name="W9YM6" /> salaries for university graduates in 2018 were lower than those of 30 years previously.<ref name="disparity" /> Many protesters in Hong Kong were young and educated: Many of them were under the age of 30, and had received tertiary education.<ref name="rFgV9" />

== Objectives ==
Initially the protesters only demanded the withdrawal of the extradition bill. Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters' objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan "Five demands, not one less"):<ref name="focustw_20190627_urgeg20" />
* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, its status of "pending resumption of second reading" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] meant that its reading could have been resumed quickly. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name="reuters_20191023_officiallykilled" />
* '''Retraction of the "riot" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as "riots", it later amended the description to say there were "some" rioters, an assertion protesters still contest. The crime of "rioting" carries a maximum penalty of 10&nbsp;years in prison.
* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider their lawbreaking acts to be mostly motivated by a politically righteous cause; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.
* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police against protesters and bystanders, arbitrary stop-and-search,<ref name="rfa_06112019114440" /> and officers' failure to observe Police General Orders pointed to a breakdown of accountability.<ref name="standnews_20190627" /> The absence of independence of the existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], is also an issue.<ref name="scmp_3030211" />
* '''Resignation of Carrie Lam and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the chief executive''':<ref name="nyt_20190708_moredemocracy" /> The chief executive is selected in a small-circle election, and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives of institutionalised interest groups, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.

==History==
===Early demonstrations===
{{Main|Timeline of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests (March–June 2019)}}

[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12&nbsp;June&nbsp;2019.]]
A sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosistō]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March 2019 was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name="now_340955" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name="hkfp_20190331_12000protest" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the Legislative Council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June 2019, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name="scmp_3011104" />

With the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June. While police estimated attendance at the march on [[Hong Kong Island]] at 270,000, the organisers claimed that 1.03&nbsp;million people had attended the rally.<ref name="time_5603754" /><ref name="reuters_20191220_hkrevolt" /> Carrie Lam insisted second reading and debate over the bill be resumed on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name="govhk_20190609_response" /> Protesters [[612 Incident|successfully stopped the LegCo from resuming second reading of the bill]] by surrounding the LegCo Complex. Riot police dispersed protesters using controversial methods such as kettling, firing tear gas, bean bag rounds and rubber bullets, and allegedly assaulted journalists in the process.<ref name="scmp_3014104" /> Police Commissioner [[Stephen Lo]] declared the clashes a "riot".<ref name="govhk_20190612_policeaction" /> Police were subsequently criticised for using excessive force, such as firing tear gas at protesters at an approved rally,<ref name="independent_8957471" /><ref name="amnesty_20190621_policereport" /> and for the lack of identification numbers on police officers' uniforms.<ref name="amnesty_20190621_policeviolence" /> Following the clashes, protesters began calling for an independent inquiry into police brutality; they also urged the government to retract the "riot" characterisation.

[[File:示威者於立法會會議廳展示標語, Jul 2019.jpg|left|thumb|Protesters briefly occupied the [[Legislative Council Complex]] on 1&nbsp;July&nbsp;2019.]]

The CHRF claimed a record turnout of 550,000 for their [[Hong Kong 1 July marches|annual march on 1&nbsp;July 2019]], while police estimated around 190,000 at the peak;<ref name="appledaily_59774211" /><ref name="hkfp_20190701_55000attend" /> an independent polling organisation estimated attendance at 260,000.<ref name="reuters_20190705_countingmarchers" /> The protest was largely peaceful. At night, partly angered by several more suicides since 15&nbsp;June 2019, some radical protesters [[Storming of the Legislative Council Complex|stormed into the Legislative Council]]; police took little action to stop them.<ref name="reuters_20190701_smashlegislature" /><ref name="cnn_20190701_newmanifesto" /><ref name="latimes_20190702_martyrnarrative" />

CHRF held another anti-extradition protest on 21&nbsp;July on Hong Kong Island. Instead of dispersing, protesters passed the police-mandated endpoint,<ref name="bbc_49061975" /> and headed for the [[Hong Kong Liaison Office|Liaison Office]] in [[Sai Ying Pun]], where they defaced the Chinese national emblem.<ref name="hkfp_20190722_condemndeface" /> While a standoff between the protesters and the police occurred on Hong Kong Island,<ref name="rthk_1469580" /> groups of white-clad individuals, suspected triad members, appeared and [[2019 Yuen Long attack|indiscriminately attacked people inside Yuen Long station]].<ref name="standardhk_131702" /> Police were absent during the attacks, and the local police stations were shuttered, leading to suspicion that the attack was coordinated with police. Pro-Beijing lawmaker [[Junius Ho]] was later seen greeting members of the group, which led to accusations that he approved of the attack.<ref name="standardhk_131702" /> The attack was often seen as the [[turning point]] for the movement, as it  crippled people's confidence in the police and turned a lot of citizens who were politically neutral or apathetic against the police.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Purbrick |first1=Martin |date=October 14, 2019 |title=A Report of the 2019 Hong Kong Protests|journal= [[Asian Affairs]]|volume= 50|issue=4 |pages= 465–487 |doi=10.1080/03068374.2019.1672397 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

On 27&nbsp;July, protesters marched in Yuen Long, despite opposition from rural groups and the police. The protest escalated into violent clashes inside Yuen Long station.<ref name="guardian_20190718_policethugs" /> The next day, protesters again defied the police ban and marched to [[Sai Wan]] and [[Causeway Bay]].<ref name="hkfp_20190729_49arrested" /> To support the arrestees charged with rioting, protesters rallied near the police stations in [[Kwai Chung]],<ref name="standardhk_210229" /> and [[Tin Shui Wai]], where protesters were attacked with fireworks launched from a moving vehicle.<ref name="hkfp_20190731_fireworkattack" /><ref name="coconutshk_20190731" />

===General strike and escalation===
{{Main|Timeline of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests (August 2019)}}

Protesters returned to Mong Kok on 3&nbsp;August 2019, though some marched to block the [[Cross-Harbour Tunnel]] toll plaza in [[Hung Hom]].<ref name="hkfp_20190803_teargas" />  A call for a [[general strike]] on 5&nbsp;August was answered by about 350,000 people according to the [[Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions|Confederation of Trade Unions]];<ref name="rthk_1472997" /> over 200 flights had to be cancelled.<ref name="scmp_3021412" /><ref name="qz_1681247" /><ref name="hkfp_20190802_generalstrike" /> Protests were held in seven districts in Hong Kong.

Various incidents involving alleged police brutality on 11&nbsp;August—police shot bean bag rounds that ruptured the eye of a female protester, the use of [[tear gas]] indoors, the deployment of undercover police as agents-provocateurs, and the firing of pepper ball rounds at protesters at a very close range—prompted protesters to stage a three-day sit-in at Hong Kong International Airport from 12 to 14&nbsp;August, forcing the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] to cancel numerous flights.<ref name="rthk_1474188" /><ref name="hp_20190813_airporthostage" /><ref name="usatoday_1996574001" /> On 13&nbsp;August, protesters at the airport cornered, tied up and assaulted two men they accused of being either undercover police or agents for the mainland, who were later identified as a tourist and a ''[[Global Times]]'' reporter.<ref name="rthk_1474483" /><ref name="reuters_20190813_reporterheld" /> A peaceful rally was held in [[Victoria Park (Hong Kong)|Victoria Park]] by the CHRF on 18&nbsp;August to denounce police brutality. The CHRF claimed attendance of at least 1.7&nbsp;million people.<ref name="scmp_3022772" /> The police put peak attendance in the Victoria Park football areas at 128,000.

[[File:Hong Kong Way 20190823 17.jpg|thumb|On 23&nbsp;August, an estimated 210,000 people participated in the "[[Hong Kong Way]]" campaign to draw attention to the movement's [[#Objectives|five demands]].

Starting from the [[Kwun Tong]] protest on 24&nbsp;August, protesters began to target railway operator [[MTR]] after it closed four stations ahead of the legal, authorised protest.<ref name="hkfp_20190922_mtrprotestors" /> During the protests of 25&nbsp;August in [[Tsuen Wan]] and [[Kwai Tsing District]]s, hardline protesters threw bricks and [[Molotov cocktail|gasoline bombs]] toward the police who in turn responded with volleys of tear gas; police [[water cannon]] trucks were deployed for the first time.<ref name="wp_20190826_warningshot" /> During the protest, one officer fired an upward [[warning shot]], marking the first use of a live round since the demonstrations broke out in June.<ref name="wp_20190826_warningshot" /><ref name="bbc_20190830_gunshot" />

Ignoring a police ban, thousands of protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong Island on 31&nbsp;August following the arrests of high-profile pro-democracy activists and lawmakers the previous day.<ref name="scmp_3025020" /><ref name="nyt_20190831_protestsresume" /><ref name="wp_20190831_defiancearrests" /> At night, the Special Tactical Squad [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|stormed Prince Edward station]], where they beat and pepper-sprayed the commuters inside.<ref name="amnesty_20190901_policeprotest" /> Protesters rallied outside the Mong Kok police station in the following weeks to condemn police brutality and demanded the MTR Corporation release the CCTV footage of that night as rumours began to circulate on the internet that the police's operation had caused death, which they denied.<ref name="scmp_3025582" /><ref name="guardian_20190910_denyclaims" />

===Decision to withdraw the extradition bill===
{{main|Timeline of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests (September 2019)}}

On 4&nbsp;September, Carrie Lam announced the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill once Legco reconvened in October and the introduction of additional measures to calm the situation. However, protests continued to insist on all five demands being met.<ref name="hkfp_20190904_toolittle" /> During the month, protesters organised various flash mob rallies to sing the protest anthem "[[Glory to Hong Kong]]".<ref name="reuters_20190910_anthembooed" /><ref name="reuters_20190909_humanchain" /> They continued their attempts to disrupt the airport's operations,<ref name="hkfp_20190907_interceptprotest" /> and held pop-up mall protests, which targeted shops and corporations perceived to be pro-Beijing.<ref name="cnn_20190922_chaosspread" />

A mass protest on 15&nbsp;September descended into chaos in North Point as a group of locals, which allegedly included a sizeable number of [[Fujian gang|people of Fujianese origin]], physically assaulted protesters.<ref name="hkfp_20190916_bloodynight" /> Carrie Lam held the first public meeting in [[Queen Elizabeth Stadium]] in Wan Chai with 150 members of the public. Protesters demanding to talk to her surrounded the venue and trapped her inside for four hours.<ref name="reuters_20190926_opendialogue" /> On 29 September, there was an anti-[[Chinese Communist Party]] rally in defiance of a police ban. Solidarity protests were held on the same day in over 40 cities around the world.<ref name="hkfp_20190930_antitotalitarianism" />

===National Day and invocation of emergency law===
{{main|Timeline of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests (October 2019)}}
[[File:2019-10-01 Demonstration Hong Kong 11.jpg|thumb|left|Hong Kong protesters threw eggs at the portrait of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] and [[paramount leader]] of China [[Xi Jinping]] on 1&nbsp;October&nbsp;2019 during the 70th [[National Day of the People's Republic of China]].]]
On 1&nbsp;October 2019, mass protests and violent conflict occurred between the protesters and police in various districts of Hong Kong during the [[70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China|70th&nbsp;anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China]]. This resulted in the first use of live rounds by police. One 18-year-old student protester was shot in the chest by police in [[Tsuen Wan]] while trying to hit a policeman with a rod.<ref name="abc_11565024" /><ref name="scmp_3031325" /><ref name="aljazeera_191002005617929" /> The police fired around 1,400 tear gas canisters and made 269 arrests on one day, setting a record for both since the protests began in June.<ref name="hkfp_20191002_singledayrecord" />

[[File:P1111040 (48870971291).jpg|thumb|right|Protesters setting up a makeshift roadblock ignited with fire in [[Causeway Bay]] on 6&nbsp;October 2019 in a march protesting against the invocation of the emergency law.]]
Carrie Lam invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] to impose a [[anti-mask law|law to ban wearing face masks in public gatherings]], attempting to curb the ongoing protests on 4&nbsp;October.<ref name="bbc_49931598" /> The law's enactment was followed by continued demonstrations in various districts of Hong Kong, blocking major thoroughfares, vandalising shops perceived to be pro-Beijing and paralysing the MTR system.<ref name="vox_20898568" /><ref name="reuters_20191004_banemergency" /><ref name="hkfp_20191004_14yoshot" /> Protests and citywide flash mob rallies persisted throughout the month.<ref name="standardhk_135533" /><ref name="scmp_3035804" />

Secretary for Security John Lee officially withdrew the extradition bill on 23&nbsp;October,<ref name="hkfp_20191023_officiallywithdrawn" /> but this has failed to stop the protesters who believed that the government was inadequate in responding to their demands.

===Intensification and sieges of the universities===
{{main|Timeline of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests (November 2019)}}

[[Doxing]] uncovered the details of a police officer's wedding in Tseung Kwan O which were leaked.<ref name="scmp_3037001" /> Protesters intending to crash the event set up roadblocks around [[Sheung Tak Estate]] and clashed with the police late at night on 3&nbsp;November 2019. Alex Chow Tsz-lok, a 22-year-old student at the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] (HKUST), was later found unconscious on the second floor of the estate's car park. He died on 8&nbsp;November following two unsuccessful brain surgeries.<ref name="mingpao_1572893617823" /><ref name="scmp_3036833" /> After his death, protesters engaged in flash mob rallies against the police and attended vigils in various districts of Hong Kong. They blamed the police for his death, though the police denied any involvement.<ref name="nyt_20191107_studentdies" />

[[File:CUHK Protester face with smoke 20191112.jpg|thumb|left|The police confronted the protesters at the entrance of the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] on 12&nbsp;November&nbsp;2019.]]

In response to Chow's death, protesters planned a city-wide strike starting on 11&nbsp;November. They disrupted transport in the morning in various districts of Hong Kong.<ref name="hkfp_20191111_liverounds" /> That morning, a policeman fired live rounds in [[Sai Wan Ho]], wounding an unarmed 21-year-old.<ref name="reuters_20191111_openfire" /> In the afternoon, police also fired tear gas in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], Hong Kong's [[Central Business District]], during a lunchtime protest, causing businesses to close early.<ref name="yahoo_123212403" /> On 14&nbsp;November, an elderly man died from a head injury which he had sustained the previous day during a confrontation between protesters and government supporters in [[Sheung Shui]].<ref name="cnn_20191114_elderlydies" /><ref name="today-emh" />

For the first time, during a standoff on 11&nbsp;November, police shot numerous rounds of tear gas, sponge grenades and rubber bullets into the campuses of universities, while protesters threw bricks and petrol bombs in response.<ref name="scmp_3037262" /> Student protesters from the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] (CUHK) [[2019 Chinese University of Hong Kong conflict|confronted the police]] for two consecutive days.<ref name="hkfp_20191112_cuhkbattleground" /> After the conflict, protesters briefly occupied several universities, which became their strongholds as they crafted various improvised offensive weapons inside.<ref name="scmp_3037990" /><ref name="npr_779399836" /> A major conflict between protesters and police took place in Hung Hom on 17&nbsp;November after protesters took control of the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]] (PolyU) and blockaded the Cross-Harbour Tunnel. Thus began the [[siege of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University|siege of PolyU]] by police which ended with them storming onto the campus and arresting several protesters and volunteer medics in the early morning of 18&nbsp;November.<ref name="rthk_1492855" /><ref name="smh_p53bgw" /> Various escape attempts were thwarted by police.<ref name="bbc_50455727" />

With PolyU under complete lockdown by police, and students inside running short of supplies, protesters outside the campus attempted to penetrate police cordons to break through to those trapped inside but were repelled by tear gas and [[Pepper-spray projectile|pepper balls]].<ref name="asiatimes_20191118_siegecrisis" /> Police action in [[Yau Ma Tei]] resulted in a stampede which was denied by police but confirmed by firefighters.<ref name="rthk_1493235" /> Hygiene on campus quickly deteriorated, and the protesters inside reported being mentally and physically weak.<ref name="scmp_3039102" /> More than 1,100 people were arrested in and around PolyU over the course of the siege.<ref name="scmp_3039868" /><ref name="hkfp_20191129_liftsiege" /> The siege was ended on 29&nbsp;November.<ref name="scmp_3039681" />

The [[2019 Hong Kong local elections|24&nbsp;November 2019 District Council election]], considered a referendum on the government and the protests, attracted a record high [[voter turnout]].<ref name="reuters_20191215_councilelections" /> The results saw the pro-democracy camp win by a landslide, with the pro-Beijing camp suffering their greatest electoral defeat in Hong Kong's history.<ref name="guardian_20191124_landslidevictory" /><ref name="nyt_20191124_backerswin" /> The unprecedented electoral success of the pro-democracy voters, the mass arrests during the PolyU siege, and faster response by police contributed to a decrease in the intensity and frequency of the protests in December 2019 and January 2020.<ref name="20200123hongkongfpA" />

Protesters returned to the streets on 1&nbsp;December in Tsim Sha Tsui to reiterate their five demands, but the police fired volleys of tear gas into the crowd and revoked the Letter of No Objection one hour after the march began,<ref name="scmp_3040135" /> after alleging that protesters were throwing [[smoke bombs]].<ref name="turnout" /> In an 8&nbsp;December mass march held to maintain pressure on the government, more than 800,000 protesters came to the streets, according to the organiser CHRF. Meanwhile, police reported the peak turnout at 183,000. The CHRF-organised march was its first permitted by police in nearly four months.<ref name="cnn_20191208_protesterspressure" />
[[File:DSCF8925 (49311981367).jpg|thumb|right|Protesters flood the streets during the New Year's march.]]
The rest of December saw the return of pop-up mall protests, with clashes occurring in several major shopping centres around the city. These pop-up protests continued during the Christmas season.<ref name="reuters_20191224_xmasprotest" /><ref name="facebook_10886856774782522" /> On 1&nbsp;January 2020, a protest was held by the CHRF in support of the protesters' demands.<ref name="rthk_1500493" /> Organisers claimed over 1,030,000 people participated in the protest, while police said peak attendance was 60,000.<ref name="rthk_1500561" /> Police cut the march short and responded with tear gas after protesters vandalised [[HSBC Building (Hong Kong)|HSBC's headquarters]] and several HSBC branches in retaliation for the [[HSBC|bank]] and the police seizing over HK$70&nbsp;million (US$9&nbsp;million) in donations for the protests from [[Spark Alliance]] in December.<ref name="scmp_3043325" /><ref name="scmp3046718" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://time.com/5757324/hong-kong-new-years-day-protests/|title=As Hong Kong's Leader Pledges to 'Listen Humbly,' Protesters Return to the Streets|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=1 January 2020|access-date=29 November 2020}}</ref> An HSBC branch had already been vandalized by protesters on 24 December for the same reason.<ref name="rthk_1499509"/>

The outbreak of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] in mainland China caused the number of large-scale rallies to dwindle further because of fears that they might facilitate the spread of the virus. Despite this, the pro-democratic movement's tactics were repurposed to pressure the government to take stronger actions to safeguard Hong Kong's [[public health]] in the face of the [[2020 coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong|coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong]].<ref name="vox21124157" /> Protesters demanded all mainland travellers be banned from entering Hong Kong. From 3&nbsp;to 7&nbsp;February 2020, hospital staff launched a labour strike with the same goal.<ref name="bbc51349154" /><ref name="scmp3049512" /> The strike was partially successful as Lam, despite rejecting a full border closure, only left three of the 14 crossing points with mainland China open.<ref name="wp_20200204" />

People responded negatively to the government's attempt to set up quarantine and clinical centres in neighbourhoods close to residents and marched to express their discontent or blocked roads to thwart the government's plans across the territory.<ref name="theatlantic605662" /><ref name="wsj_11580475635" /> Between late January and early February, [[improvised explosive devices]] were found in several locations, and petrol bombs were thrown at four police stations and a patrol car, in a wave of action over the government's failure to close the city's border and supply protective gear.<ref name="scmp3049080" />

As the coronavirus crisis escalated in February and March 2020, the scale of the protests dwindled further.<ref name="20200315theguardian" /><ref name="20200225hongkongfp" /> Police have used coronavirus laws banning groups of more than four, for example, to disperse protesters.<ref name="UAWgq" /><ref name="EMbMa" /> On 18 April, police arrested 15 pro-democracy activists including [[Jimmy Lai]], [[Martin Lee]] and [[Margaret Ng]] for their activities in 2019, drawing international condemnation.<ref name="F0e4K" /> On 15 May, a 21-year-old young man surnamed Sin was sentenced to four years in prison for his participation in the [[612 Incident|12 June protest]], becoming the first person to be jailed for the charge of [[rioting]] since the protest movement started.<ref name="lTsEE" />

===Implementation of the national security law===

[[File:Tear Gas in CWB Hennessy Road View 20200524.png|thumb|left|Tear gas was used for the first time in two months on 24 May as thousands of protesters marched against both the [[National Anthem Bill]] and the national security law]]
<!--
In October 2019, the pro-democratic bloc in the LegCo launched a filibuster campaign led by vice-chairman [[Dennis Kwok]], who presided over the LegCo meetings, to stall the House Committee election procedures and thereby the second reading of the [[National Anthem Bill]], a bill that was considered to be "evil" by the democrats.<ref name="scmp3081494" /><ref name="qJuBc" /> A [[Hong Kong Watch]] article opined that the filibustering was the only strategy available to the democrats, because of their marginalisation in the LegCo despite them representing the majority of the population.<ref name="20200508hongkongwatch" /> The directors of the Chinese [[Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office]] (HKMAO) and the [[Hong Kong Liaison Office|Liaison Office]] threatened to disqualify Kwok. Their actions were controversial as Article 22 of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] states that no department of the [[Central People's Government]] can interfere in Hong Kong's affairs. The two directors claimed that the two departments were exempted, and this was agreed by Lam's administration despite saying otherwise in the past.<ref name="scmp3081816" /> Pro-Beijing lawmaker [[Starry Lee]] was re-elected House Committee chairwoman on 18 May after security guards removed most pro-democracy members due to a violent scuffle before the vote was called.<ref name="Fzgg5" />
-->
On 21 May 2020, state media announced that the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) would begin [[National People's Congress Decision on Hong Kong national security legislation|drafting]] [[Hong Kong national security law|a new law]] that covers "secession, foreign interference, terrorism and subversion against the central government", to be added into the Annex III of the Hong Kong Basic Law. This meant that the law would come into effect through [[promulgation]], bypassing local legislation.<ref name="20200521hongkongfp" /> Observers considered this as China's boldest step yet to bring Hong Kong under its control, and accused it of depreciating the "one country, two systems" principle in violation of the terms of the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]]. They expected that it would have far-reaching effects on the city's freedom of expression and future economic success.<ref name="20200521nytimes" /><ref name="aljazeera2005220322" /> The UK, along with Australia, Canada, and the US also issued a joint statement expressing their deep concern regarding the National Security Law on 28 May.<ref name="ADQPF" /> Despite international pressure, the NPCSC passed the national security legislation on 28 May.<ref name="bbc52829176" /><ref name="aJvjP" />

[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190812 170957 (48520377932).jpg|thumb|The national security law banned anyone from shouting or displaying the slogan "[[Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times]]" ({{Lang-zh|link=no|t=光復香港，時代革命}}), which has achieved mainstream adoption since July 2019.<ref name="slogan explainer" /><ref name="PZmlS" />]]
The draft sparked increased protests: the mass march on 24 May in Causeway Bay was the largest protest since the beginning of the pandemic, as civilians responded to online calls to march against both the National Anthem Bill and the proposed national security law.<ref name="20200524cnbc" /> For the first time in two months, the police deployed tear gas in an attempt to disperse the protesters.<ref name="20200524bloomberg" /> On 27 May at least 396 people were arrested during a day-long protest across Hong Kong over the national anthem bill's reading on the same day and the anti-sedition law; most of the arrested were taken into custody even before any protest actions had begun.<ref name="scmp3087451" />

On 30 June, the NPCSC passed the national security law unanimously, without informing the public and the local officials of the content of the law.<ref name="cPPxk" /> The law creates a [[chilling effect]] in the city. [[Demosistō]], which had been involved in lobbying for other nations' support, and several [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independent]] groups announced that they had decided to disband and cease all operations, fearing that they would be the targets of the new law.<ref name="aXz4I" /> Thousands of protesters showed up on July 1 to protest against the newly implemented law. On that day, the police arrested at least ten people for breaching national security as they deemed that individuals who displayed or possessed flags, placards and phone stickers with protest slogans or other [[protest art]] have already committed the crime of "subverting the country".<ref name="B75MR" />

Following the implementation of the national security law, the international community reassessed their policies towards China.

The [[2019 Yuen Long attack]] occurred following a mass protest organised by the CHRF on 21&nbsp;July.

Amidst frustration that police had failed to prosecute pro-government violent counter-protesters and being increasingly distrustful of police because of this,<ref name="nyt_20191007_ownjustice" /> hard-core protesters began to carry out [[Vigilantism|vigilante attacks]]—described by protesters as "settling matters privately" —targeting individuals perceived to be foes.<ref name="nyt_20191007_ownjustice" /><ref name="telegraph_20191008_vigilanteviolence" /> Pro-Beijing actress [[Celine Ma]],<ref name="malaymail_1798017_celinema" /> plainclothed officers,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3046726/hong-kong-protests-tear-gas-fired-arrests-rally-universal|title=Hong Kong protests: two plain-clothes police officers beaten up, tear gas fired and rally organiser arrested as mayhem breaks out in Central|first=Phila|last=Siu|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=January 19, 2020|access-date=October 7, 2020}}</ref> and a taxi driver who drove into a crowd of protesters in [[Sham Shui Po]] on 8&nbsp;October, were attacked.<ref name="scmp_3033050" /> A middle-aged man was doused with flammable liquid and set on fire by a protester after he had an altercation with protesters at [[Ma On Shan station]] on 11&nbsp;November.<ref name="fr24_20191113_manonfire" /><ref name="hkfp_20191111_manonfire" /> On 14&nbsp;November, an elderly man died from head injuries sustained earlier during a violent confrontation between two groups of protesters and pro-government Sheung Shui residents.<ref name="ch-lc" />

==Deaths==
=== By suicide ===

[[File:Hong Kong protests suicides mourning area.jpg|thumb|Mourning area for Marco Leung and Lo, located near [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]], which was later destroyed by a pro-government group.]]
Several suicide cases were linked to the protests. The first suicide took place on 15&nbsp;June 2019, when 35-year-old Marco Leung Ling-kit climbed the elevated podium on the rooftop of [[Pacific Place (Hong Kong)|Pacific Place]] in Admiralty, and hung banners on the scaffolding with several anti-extradition slogans.<ref name="time_5607742" /><ref name="straitstimes_20190616_fatalfall" /> He wore a yellow raincoat with the words "Carrie Lam is killing Hong Kong" in Chinese written on the back.<ref name="time_5607742" /> After a five-hour standoff, during which police officers and Democratic Party legislator [[Roy Kwong]] attempted to talk him down, Leung fell to his death, missing an inflatable cushion set up by firefighters.<ref name="hkfp_20190615_manjump" /><ref name="time_5607742" /><ref name="straitstimes_20190616_fatalfall" /> His anti-extradition slogans later became the foundations for the "five demands" of the protests.<ref name="slogan explainer" /> A ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article dated 22 October 2019 reported that "protesters have tracked at least nine cases of suicides that appear to be linked directly to the demonstrations" since June.<ref name="guardian_20191022_mentalhealth" /> In five of these cases, the victims left a [[suicide note]] referring to the protests, and three were attributed to events following the extradition bill.<ref name="straitstimes_20190616_fatalfall" /><ref name="appledaily_60010806" /><ref name="oncc_20190629" /><ref name="shanghaiist_20190701_thirdsuicide" />

Several deaths, most notably, that of [[death of Chan Yin-lam|Chan Yin-lam]], a 15-year-old girl whom the police suspected had committed suicide, were the subject of a [[conspiracy theory]] given the unusual circumstances surrounding her death. Chan's naked corpse was found floating in the sea near Yau Tong on 22 September 2019, despite her having been an avid swimmer.<ref name="GeMyK" /> Protesters alleged that the police murdered them for participating in the protests and covered-up the deaths.<ref name="eji_20191028_fakenews" /><ref name="bloomberg_20191111_fakenews" /><ref name="trust vacuum" /> The police, in response, denied those allegations, and were supported in this by a March 2020 report by the [[United States Department of State]].<ref name="PWGgh" />

==Tactics and methods==
{{main|Tactics and methods surrounding the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests}}

[[File:IMGP1850 (49151831526).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Winnie-the-Pooh|Winnie the Pooh]] toy used to symbolise [[Xi Jinping]] with the [[Art of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests#Flags and symbols|Chinazi]] flag stuck on it, used in the 1&nbsp;December 2019 protests]]

The protests have been described as being largely "leaderless".<ref name="bloomberg_20190823_onlineworld" /> No group or political party has claimed leadership over the movement, though civic groups and prominent politicians have played a supportive role, such as applying for Letters of No Objection from the police or mediating conflicts between protesters and police officers.<ref name="latimes_20190614_withoutleaders" /> Protesters commonly used [[LIHKG]], an online forum similar to [[Reddit]], as well as [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]], an [[Comparison of instant messaging clients#Messengers with client-to-client encryption|optionally end-to-end encrypted messaging service]] to communicate and brainstorm ideas for protests and to make collective decisions.<ref name="bloomberg_20190823_onlineworld" /> Unlike previous protests, those of 2019 spread over 20 different neighbourhoods, so the entire territory witnessed them.<ref name="cna_11783460" /> Protesters and their supporters remained anonymous to avoid prosecutions or future potential retaliation from the authorities, employers who had a different political orientation, and corporations which kowtowed to political pressure.<ref name="theverge20926585" />

For the most part there are two groups of protesters, namely the "peaceful, rational and non-violent" protesters and the "fighters" group.<ref name="guardian_20190818_fightresist" /> Nonetheless, despite differences in methods, both groups have refrained from denouncing or criticising the other and provided tacit support. The principle was the "Do Not Split"— [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]—which was aimed to promote mutual respect for different views within the same protest movement. This was a response to the failure of the Umbrella Revolution which fell apart partly due to internal conflicts within the pro-democratic bloc.<ref name="nyt_20190628_selfregulate" /><ref name="caught fire" />

===Moderate group===
{{further|Art of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests}}

The moderate group participated in different capacities. The peaceful group held mass rallies, flash mobs, and engaged in other forms of protest such as [[hunger strike]]s,<ref name="ucan_85612" /> forming [[human chain (politics)|human chains]],<ref name="bbc_49452986" /> launching petitions,<ref name="hkfp_20190530_hundredspetitions" /> labour strikes,<ref name="reuters_20190902_latenight" /> and class boycotts.<ref name="guardian_20190902_studentboycott" /><ref name="straitstimes_20190903_studentboycott" /> [[Lennon Wall (Hong Kong)|Lennon Walls]] were set up in various neighbourhoods to spread messages of support and display protest art.<ref name="scmp3019352" /><ref name="hkfp_20190709_lennonwall" /> Protesters had set up pop-up stores that sold cheap protest gadgets,<ref name="reuters_20191011_hardwarestore" /> provided undercover clinics for young activists,<ref name="20191027hongkongfp" /> and [[crowdfund]]ed to help people in need of medical or legal assistance.<ref name="scmp_3017548" />

To raise awareness of their cause and to keep citizens informed, artists supporting the protest created [[protest art]] and [[derivative work]]s, many of which mock the police and the government.<ref name="hkfp_20190725_postersevolution" /> Twitter and Reddit were used to deliver information about the protests to raise awareness to users abroad,<ref name="qz_1698002" /><ref name="medium_519ab2861783" /> while platforms like Facebook and [[Instagram]] were employed to circulate images of police brutality.<ref name="DJl34" /> Protesters held "civil press conferences" to counter press conferences by police and the government.<ref name="hkfp_20190806_maskedpressconf" /> [[AirDrop]] was used to broadcast anti-extradition bill information to the public and mainland tourists.<ref name="ft_20190702_mobiliselessons" /> A protest anthem, "[[Glory to Hong Kong]]", was composed, its lyrics crowdsourced on the LIHKG online forum, and sung by flash mobs in shopping centres.<ref name="latimes_20190913_protestanthem" /> The [[Lady Liberty Hong Kong]] statue was also crowdfunded by citizens to commemorate the protests.<ref name="reuters_20191013_metroshoptargeted" />

Protesters have attempted to gain international support. Activists organised and coordinated numerous rallies to this end.<ref name="scmp_3016149" /><ref name="time5622571" /> [[Joshua Wong]], [[Denise Ho]] and several other democrats provided testimonies during the US congressional hearing for the [[Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act]].<ref name="hkfp_20190917_congressionalhearing" /> To increase the political pressure on China, they also advocated for the suspension of the [[United States–Hong Kong Policy Act]], which grants Hong Kong's special status as the city is considered as a separate entity from mainland China for matters concerning trade export and economics control after the 1997 handover.<ref name="ogANT" /> Advertisements on the protestors' cause were financed by crowdfunding and placed in major international newspapers in July 2019, ahead of the G20 summit in Osaka;<ref name="hkfp_20190628_g20appeal" /> two further advertising campaigns followed until 12 August 2019.<ref name="scmp_3022498" /> At events, protesters waved the [[national flag]]s of other countries, such as the [[Flag of the United States of America|United States]] and the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], calling for their support.<ref name="hkfp_20190713_colonialflag" />

Efforts were made to transform the protests into a long-lasting movement. Protesters have advocated a "[[Yellow Economic Circle]]".<ref name="scmp_3023313" /> Supporters of the protesters labelled different establishments based on their political stance and chose to patronise only in businesses which are sympathetic to the movement, while boycotting businesses supporting or owned by mainland Chinese interests.<ref name="scmp_3035914" /><ref name="AutoSM-6" /> Flash mob rallies were held in the central business districts as office workers used their lunch break to march on the street.<ref name="scmp3036866" /> The protests prompted various professions to set up labour unions that compete with pro-Beijing lobbies to pressure the government further.<ref name="theatlantic606136" /> Newly elected District Council members put forward motions to condemn the police and used their power to assist the detained protesters.<ref name="theatlantic605275" /> Pro-democratic lawmakers also put forward a motion to impeach Lam, though it was rejected by the pro-Beijing lawmakers in December 2019.<ref name="20191205hongkongfp" />

===Radical group===
[[File:Hong Kong protests - Kwong Tong March 20190824 - P1066327.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters adopted the [[black bloc]] method and wore helmets and [[respirators]] to protect themselves. Yellow [[hard hat]]s became a symbol for the protest movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1675393/hardhats-are-the-new-symbol-of-hong-kongs-protests/|title=Hardhats have replaced umbrellas as the symbol of Hong Kong's protests|first=Mary|last=Hui|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|date=July 26, 2019|access-date=August 6, 2020}}</ref>]]
[[File:Sheung Yuet Road lamppost after protesters destroy 20190824.jpg|thumb|A "smart" lamppost was destroyed by protesters on 24&nbsp;August&nbsp;2019, due to beliefs that it could be used for [[surveillance]].<ref name="scmp_3024428" />]]
Radical protesters adopted the "be water" strategy, inspired by [[Bruce Lee]]'s philosophy, often moving in a fluid and agile fashion to confound and confuse the police.<ref name="hkfp_20190621_convergehq" /><ref name="ft_20190902_waterrevolution" /> They often retreated when police arrived, only to re-emerge elsewhere.<ref name="independent_9045311" /> In addition, protesters adopted [[black bloc]] tactics to protect their identities. Frontliners' "full gear" consisted of umbrellas, face masks, [[hard hat]]s and [[respirator]]s to shield themselves from projectiles and teargas.<ref name="hkfp_20190809_toolkitevolved" /> Furthermore, protesters used [[laser pointer]]s to distract police officers and interfere with the operation of their cameras.<ref name="hkfp_20190809_toolkitevolved" /> At protest scenes, protesters used hand gestures for nonverbal communication, and supplies were delivered via human chains.<ref name="newstatesman_20190801_bewater" /> Different protesters adopted different roles. Some were "[[Lookout|scouts]]" who shared real-time updates whenever they spotted the police,<ref name="scmp114284" /><ref name="20190823theguardian" /> while others were "firefighters" who extinguished tear gas with kitchenware and traffic cones.<ref name="tear gas creativity" /> A [[HKmap.live|mobile app]] was developed to allow crowdsourcing the location of police.<ref name="scmp_3032001" />

Starting in August 2019, radical protesters escalated the controversial use of violence and intimidation. They dug up paving bricks and threw them at police; others used petrol bombs, corrosive liquid and other projectiles against police. Petrol bombs were also hurled by protesters at police stations and vehicles.<ref name="bbc_50115629" /><ref name="rthk_1481829" /><ref name="hkfp_20191004_14yoshot" /> As a result of clashes, there were multiple reports of police injuries and the assault of officers throughout the protests.<ref name="bbc_20190830_gunshot" /><ref name="ap_20190824_36arrested" /> One officer was slashed in the neck with a [[box cutter]],<ref name="standardhk_135533" /> and a media liaison officer was shot in the leg with an arrow during the PolyU siege.<ref name="cnn_20191117_undersiege" /> The police also accused the protesters of intending to "kill or harm" police officers after a remote-controlled explosive device detonated on 13&nbsp;October near a police vehicle.<ref name="wp_20191019_homemadebomb" /> Protesters also directed violence towards undercover officers suspected to be agent-provocateurs.<ref name="hk01_364980" /><ref>{{cite news |title='Undercover officer' beaten in Tseung Kwan O |url=https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1485947-20191013.htm |access-date=4 September 2020 |date=13 October 2019}}</ref> Several individuals were arrested for illegal possession of firearms or making homemade explosives.<ref name="scmp_3043251" />

Unlike other civil unrests, little random smashing and looting were observed, as protesters vandalised targets they believed embodied injustice.<ref name="guardian_20191006_violencespiralled" /> Corporations that protesters accused of being pro-Beijing, mainland Chinese companies, and shops engaging in [[Parallel trading in Hong Kong|parallel trading]], were also vandalised, subject to arson or spray-painted.<ref name="reuters_20191002_protestcrosshairs" /><ref name="standardhk_135017" /><ref name="scmp_3022287" /><ref name="scmp_3018473" /> Protesters also directed violence at symbols of the government by vandalising government and pro-Beijing lawmakers' offices,<ref name="scmp_3030889" /><ref name="hkfp_20190722_juniustrashed" /> and defacing symbols representing China.<ref name="hkfp_20190722_hurtfeelings" /><ref name="telegraph_20191008_vigilanteviolence" /> The [[MTR Corporation]] became a target of vandalism after protesters had accused the railway operator of kowtowing to pressure by Chinese media,<ref name="hkfp_20190922_mtrprotestors" /> Protestors also demanded the release of CCTV footage from the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|2019 Prince Edward station incident]] amid fears that police may have beaten someone to death.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hong Kong lawmaker and protesters demand CCTV footage of police storming MTR station |url=https://hongkongfp.com/2019/09/06/hong-kong-lawmaker-protesters-demand-cctv-footage-police-storming-mtr-station/ |access-date=3 September 2020 |date=6 September 2019}}</ref> Protesters also disrupted traffic by setting up roadblocks,<ref name="scmp_3019845" /><ref name="hkfp_20190803_teargas" /> damaging [[traffic light]]s,<ref name="rthk_1487395" /> deflating the tires of buses,<ref name="scmp_3037434" /> and throwing objects onto railway tracks.<ref name="scmp3037270" /> Protesters occasionally intimidated and assaulted mainlanders.<ref name="scmp_3031708" />

Some radical protesters promoted the idea of "mutual destruction" or "phoenixism", these terms being translations of the Cantonese [[lam chau (doctrine)|''lam chau'']]. They theorised that sanctions against the ruling [[Chinese Communist Party]] and the loss of Hong Kong's international finance centre and special trade status (caused by China's interference of the one-country, two systems principle) would destabilise mainland China's economy, and therefore, undermine the rule of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and give Hong Kong a chance to be "reborn" in the future.<ref name="izCH8" /><ref name="unity between groups" /> They believed that further government crackdown would ultimately speed up the process of ''lam chau'', ultimately hurting the regime.<ref>{{cite web|date=2020-05-28|title=Analysis: With a new law for Hong Kong, Beijing makes clear sovereignty is its bottom line|url=https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-05-28/china-makes-clear-sovereignty-is-bottom-line-hong-kong-national-security-law|access-date=2020-07-04|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

==Online confrontations==

=== Doxing and cyberbullying ===
[[Doxing]] and [[cyberbullying]] were tactics used by both supporters and opponents of the protests. Some protesters used these tactics on police officers and their families and uploaded their personal information online.<ref name="nyt_20190726_facialrecognition" /> By early July 2019, an estimated 1,000 officers' personal details had been reportedly leaked online, and nine individuals had been arrested. Affected officers, their friends and families were subject to death threats and intimidation.<ref name="rthk_1466464" /> By early June 2020, the number of officers doxed on social media was estimated at 1,752.<ref name="scmp_3044684" /> Some protesters who found their personal information and photos circulating on pro-Beijing pages on Facebook and other social media platforms after they had been stopped and searched by police, suspected the leaked photos were taken during the stop-and-searches. In a response, police said they had procedures to ensure that their members complied with privacy laws.<ref name="standnews_20191029_policephoto" /> HK Leaks, an anonymous website based in Russia, and promoted by groups linked to the [[Communist Party of China]], doxed about 200 people seen as being supportive of the protests. An ''Apple Daily'' reporter who was doxed by the website was targeted with sexual harassment via "hundreds of threatening calls".<ref name="hkfp_20191101_activistsdox" /> University student leaders also received [[death threat]]s.<ref name="r71bI" /> Protest leaders have been attacked after being doxed.<ref>{{cite news |title=Someone Is Doxing Hong Kong Protesters And Journalists — And China Wants Them To Keep Going |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/rosalindadams/hong-kong-doxing-protesters-china-encourage |access-date=4 September 2020 |date=20 September 2019}}</ref> According to the [[Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data]], as of 30&nbsp;August 2019, the proportion of doxing cases involving police officers comprised 59% of all reported and discovered cases. The remaining 41% of doxing cases involved other people such as protesters, those holding different political views, citizens and their family members.<ref name="hk01_369923" /> No arrests have been made for doxing protesters.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hong Kong Policeman Who Fired His Gun Now Faces Death Threats |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-01/hong-kong-policeman-who-fired-his-gun-now-faces-death-threats |access-date=4 September 2020 |date=1 November 2019}}</ref>

On 25&nbsp;October 2019, Hong Kong Police obtained a court [[injunction]] prohibiting anyone from sharing any personal information about police officers or their families.<ref name="hkfp_20191025_personalinfo" /> The ban was criticised for the possibility of producing a chilling effect on free speech; it was also criticised for having an excessively broad scope.<ref name="hkfp_20191103_injunctiondoxxing" /><ref name="nyt_20191027_hotelbrawl" /> [[Cheng Lai-king]], the chairwoman of the [[Central and Western District Council]], was arrested for [[sedition]] after she shared a Facebook post which contains the personal information of a policeman who allegedly blinded the eye of an Indonesian journalist. The arrest was controversial as the sedition law was established during the colonial era and was rarely used.<ref name="KvaE8" />

=== Spread of misinformation and propaganda ===
Both sides of the protests spread unverified rumours, misinformation and [[disinformation]], which caused heightened reactions and polarisation among the public. This included tactics such as using selective cuts of news footage and creating false narratives.<ref name="bloomberg_20191111_fakenews" /><ref name="japantimes_20191112_fakenews" /><ref name="swissinfo_45380788" /><ref name="hkfp_20191121_fakenews" /> Following the Prince Edward station incident, pro-democracy protesters laid down white flowers outside the station's exit to mourn the "deceased" for weeks after rumours circulated on the internet alleging that the police had beaten people to death during the operation.<ref name="atlantic_601804" /> The police, fire service, hospital authority and the government all denied the accusation.<ref name="rthk_1479347" /> Rumours that female protesters were offering "free sex" to their male counterparts were repeated by a senior government member.<ref name="hkfp_20190910_sexfalseclaim" /> Another rumour was that the [[CIA]] was involved in instigating the protests after photographs of Caucasian men taking part in the protests were shared online.<ref name="cnn_20190811_misinformationwar" /> Pro-Beijing camp also claimed pro-democracy lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting was responsible for bringing protestors to Yuen Long causing the attack to occur, despite the fact that Lam himself was a victim of the attack and arrived after the attack began.<ref>{{cite news |title=Democrat says pro-Beijing protesters are 'repeating a lie' that he was behind Yuen Long mob attack |url=https://hongkongfp.com/2020/01/13/democrat-says-pro-beijing-protesters-repeating-lie-behind-yuen-long-mob-attack/|first=Kris|last=Cheng|work=[[Hong Kong Free Press]] |access-date=3 September 2020 |date=13 January 2020}}</ref> The police blamed fake news for causing public's distrust towards law enforcement,<ref name="wvv0G" /> though the police itself were also accused by several media outlets and prosecutors of lying to the public.<ref name="rthk_1478378" /><ref name="hkfp_20191104_presscon" />

On 19 August 2019, both Twitter and Facebook announced that they had discovered what they described as large-scale disinformation campaigns operating on their social networks.<ref name="twitterpr_20190819_chinacampaign" /><ref name="fbpr_20190819_chinacib" /> Facebook found posts which included images that were altered or taken out of context, often with captions intended to vilify and discredit the protesters.<ref name="latimes_20190809_fbttdisinformation" /> According to investigations by Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, some attacks were coordinated, state-backed operations that were believed to have been carried out by agents of the Chinese government.<ref name="verge_20812621" /> A report by the [[Australian Strategic Policy Institute|ASPI]] found that the purported disinformation campaign promoted three main narratives: condemnation of the protesters, support for the Hong Kong Police, and "conspiracy theories about Western involvement in the protests."<ref name="aspi_20190903_prelimanalysis" /> Google, Facebook, and Twitter banned these accounts. In a Facebook post, the Hong Kong edition of state-run ''[[China Daily]]'' suggested the protesters would launch a terrorist attack on 11&nbsp;September 2019, producing as sole evidence a screenshot which it claimed to be from a group chat message on Telegram.<ref name="scmp_3026563" />

===Cyberattacks===
On 13 June 2019, allegations of organised cyberattacks were made against the Chinese government. [[Pavel Durov]], the founder of Telegram, suggested that the Chinese government may be behind the DDoS attacks on Telegram. On Twitter, Durov called the attack a "state actor-sized DDoS" because the attacks were mainly from IP addresses located in China. Additionally, Durov further tweeted that some of the DDoS attacks coincided with the [[12 June 2019 Hong Kong protest|protest on 12&nbsp;June 2019]].<ref name="verge_18677282" /> Anonymous LIHKG moderators also suggested that the DDoS attack they experienced on 31&nbsp;August 2019 were "unprecedented" and that they have "reasons to believe that there is a power, or even a national level power behind... such attacks." The forum identified two Chinese websites as being among those involved in the attack, including [[Baidu Tieba]].<ref name="qz_1700210" />

According to polls conducted by the [[Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute]], net approval of the Hong Kong Police Force fell to 22 per cent in mid-2019, due to its handling of the protests.<ref name="coconuts" /> At the end of July, 60 per cent of respondents in public surveys were dissatisfied with police handling of incidents since June 2019.<ref name="inquirer124403" /> Nearly 70 per cent of Hong Kong citizens believe the police have acted unprofessionally by making indiscriminate arrests and losing self-control.<ref name="ejinsight20191106" /> Their role and actions have raised questions about their accountability, the manner in which they wielded their physical force, and their crowd control methods. There have also been allegations of lack of consistency of law enforcement whether through deliberate inaction or poor organisation.

===Inappropriate use of force===
Hong Kong police were accused of using excessive and disproportionate force and not following both international safety guidelines and internal protocols while using their weapons.<ref name="WPost Police misconduct" /><ref name="amnesty_20190621_policeviolence" /> According to [[Amnesty International]], police aimed horizontally while firing, targeting protestors' heads and torsos.<ref name="amnesty_20190621_policeviolence" /><ref name="hkfp_20191112_cuhkbattleground" /> Police use of bean bag rounds and [[rubber bullets]] allegedly ruptured the eyes of several protesters and the eye of an Indonesian journalist.<ref name="scmp_3014356" /><ref name="hk01_363222" /><ref name="guardian_20191003_journalistblinded" /> Police were found to have been using tear gas as an offensive weapon,<ref name="nyt_20190818_1800teargas" /> firing it indoors inside a railway station,<ref name="nyt_20190818_1800teargas" /> using expired tear gas, which could release toxic gases upon combustion,<ref name="hkfp_20190809_coughedblood" /> and firing canisters from high-rise buildings.<ref name="d6g2J" /> Between June and November 2019, approximately 10,000 volleys of gas had been fired.<ref name="rthk_1494810" /> Chemical residues were found on different public facilities in various neighbourhoods.<ref name="rthk_1479994" /><ref name="eji_20190820" />{{efn|The government refused to disclose the chemical composition of the gas, citing "operational concerns".<ref name="standardhk_137363" />}} The use of tear gas sparked public health concerns after a reporter was diagnosed with [[chloracne]] in November 2019,<ref name="hkfp_20191114_diagnosedclorance" /> though both the environment department and the health department disputed these claims.<ref name="uQuUt" />

Some police officers wore face masks,<ref name="standardhk_136124" /> did not wear uniforms with identification numbers or failed to display their warrant cards,<ref name="hkfp_20190621_displayid" /><ref name="scmp_3017775" /> making it difficult for citizens to file complaints. The government explained that there was not enough space on their uniforms to accommodate their identification numbers. The government later introduced "call signs" to replace warrant cards, but it was found that officers shared call signs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1499780-20191227.htm|title=Multiple officers wear same 'unique' call signs|work=[[RTHK]]|date=December 27, 2019|access-date=October 7, 2020}}</ref> Police officers subsequently violated their uniform guidelines by plastering their uniform with various decorations, which led to doubts about the previous statements on limited space on the uniforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hongkongfp.com/2020/06/29/hong-kong-officers-wearing-unofficial-uniform-adornments-understandable-and-help-boost-morale-say-police/|title=Hong Kong officers wearing unofficial uniform adornments 'understandable' and help 'boost morale,' say police|first=Kelly|last=Ho|work=[[Hong Kong Free Press]]|date=June 29, 2020|access-date=October 7, 2020}}</ref> The court ruled in November 2020 that the police had breached the [[Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance]] by hiding or not displaying their identification number.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/yp/discover/news/hong-kong/article/3110749/judge-rules-against-police-who-did-not-show|title=Judge rules against police who did not show identification during Hong Kong protests|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=November 20, 2020|accessdate=November 25, 2020}}</ref>

The police has also repeatedly interfered with the justice process.  It has been suspected of [[tampering with evidence]],<ref name="scmp_3022592" /><ref name="hkfp_20190808_leaderfreed" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Man arrested for 831 Prince Edward police raid fled Hong Kong after charges multiply |url=https://hk.appledaily.com/us/20200831/M2H7ITOLYJHU3KVJSEBG5Y3TVU/ |access-date=3 September 2020 |date=31 August 2020}}</ref> giving false testimony before court,<ref>{{cite news |title=Officers told lie after lie in assault case |url=https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1543300-20200812.htm |access-date=3 September 2020 |date=12 August 2020}}</ref> and coercing false confessions from arrestees.<ref>{{cite news |title=Court acquits Hong Kong man accused of pushing policeman during protests |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3092224/court-acquits-hong-kong-man-accused-pushing-policeman |access-date=3 September 2020 |date=7 July 2020}}</ref> The deployment of [[undercover officer]]s who were suspected of committing arson and vandalism also generated controversy, and the ability of police officers to identify the differences between ordinary protesters and undercover officers was questioned.<ref name="trust vacuum" /><ref name="rthk_1478096" />  A police officer was arrested in April 2020 for perverting the course of justice after he allegedly instructed a teen to throw petrol bombs at a police station he works at.{{efn|The teen was arrested before any petrol bomb was thrown.}}<ref name="38WUY" />

Some uniformed officers used foul language to harass and humiliate protesters and journalists<ref name="qz_1647631" /> and provoked protesters.<ref name="appledaily_59799355" /> The slur "cockroach"—whose dehumanising qualities have been recognised in the social sciences and psychology—was used frequently by frontline officers to insult protesters; some officers sought to counter this development,<ref>{{cite news |title=Can the term 'cockroach' actually be a compliment for Hong Kong protesters?

===Lack of accountability===
Police modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence "officers will be accountable for their own actions" ahead of the 1&nbsp;October 2019 confrontation. Police sources of the ''Washington Post'' have said that a culture of impunity pervades the police force, such that riot police often disregarded their training or became dishonest in official reports to justify excessive force.<ref name="WPost Police misconduct" /> Some frontline officers reportedly believed that they were entitled to punish the "rioters": contravening rules that minimum force should be used. Police officers who felt that their actions were not justified were marginalised.<ref name="vfU9q" /> Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them.<ref name="WPost Police misconduct" /> Lam's administration also denied police wrongdoings and backed the police multiple times.<ref name="Lam on brutality" /> As of December 2019, no officer had been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name="WPost Police misconduct" /> When the District Councils were passing motions to condemn police violence, police commissioner [[Chris Tang]] and other civil servants walked out in protest.<ref name="tWqcv" />

The [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) launched investigations into alleged incidents of police misconduct during the protests. Protesters demanded an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and it lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements, and hand out penalties.<ref name="hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog" /><ref name="eji_20190822" /><ref name="hkfp_20190904_toolittle" /> Despite calls from both local<ref name="wj4BQ" /> and international [[opinion leader]]s, [[Carrie Lam]] and both police commissioners [[Stephen Lo]] and [[Chris Tang]] rejected the formation of an independent committee.<ref name="MdhRA" /> Lam insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task,<ref name="scmp_3025948" /> while Tang called the formation of such a committee an "injustice" and a "tool for inciting hatred" against the force.<ref name="WPost Police misconduct" />

On 8&nbsp;November 2019, a five-member expert panel headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the "powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name="hkstandard_136821" /> After negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through, the five panel members quit on 11 December 2019.<ref name="rthk_1497054" /> The IPCC report on police behaviour during the protests released in May 2020 concluded that police has mostly followed the guidelines though there was room for improvement.<ref name="KJAHl" /> While government officials called the report "comprehensive", democrats and human rights organisations were unanimous in declaring it a whitewash of police misdeeds.<ref name="XuWwH" /> One of the expert panel members, [[Clifford Stott]], said in June 2020 that the police had misjudged the dynamics of the protests and had used disproportionate force at almost all protests, thus creating more disorder than it prevented.<ref name="3Wl5W" /> A report co-authored by Stott, published in November 2020, saw the "absence of any credible system of accountability for the police" as one major reason for why the protests became more radical.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hongkongfp.com/2020/11/19/hong-kong-police-played-pivotal-role-in-radicalising-protests-in-build-up-to-poly-u-seige-policing-expert-report-says/|title=Hong Kong police played pivotal role in radicalising protests in build-up to Poly-U siege, policing expert report says|first=Rhoda|last=Kwan|work=[[Hong Kong Free Press]]|date=19 November 2020|access-date=1 December 2020}}</ref>

==Local media coverage==

The protests received significant press attention. Nathan Ruser from [[Australian Strategic Policy Institute|ASPI]] identified the protests as the most live-streamed social unrest in history. According to a poll conducted by CUHK, live feeds have replaced traditional media, social media and Telegram as the main way for citizens of Hong Kong to access protest-related information. Ruser suggested that unlike other protests, the widespread use of livestreaming technology in the Hong Kong protests meant that there was "almost parity  when it comes to what [one] can learn remotely researching it to actually being there".<ref name="QYgwj" />

Many of Hong Kong's media outlets are owned by local tycoons who have significant business ties in the mainland, so many of them adopt [[self-censorship]] at some level and have mostly maintained a conservative editorial line in their coverage of the protests. The management of some firms have forced journalists to change their headline to sound less sympathetic to the protest movement.<ref name="DW Censorship" /> A report by ''[[BBC]]'' suggested that the management of local terrestrial broadcaster [[Television Broadcasts Limited]] (TVB) had forced employees to include more voices supporting the government and highlight the aggressive actions of the protesters, without including segments focusing on the responses from the protesters or the democrats.<ref name="7Gvoz" /> Journalists from ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', which was acquired by the Chinese [[Alibaba Group]] in 2016, had their news pieces significantly altered by senior editors to include a pro-government viewpoint before they were published.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/08/scmp-hong-kong-china-media/614719/|title=A Newsroom at the Edge of Autocracy|first=Timothy|last=McLaughlin|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=August 1, 2020|access-date=August 3, 2020}}</ref> TVB and local news outlet [[HK01]] were accused of pro-government bias, and protesters have physically assaulted their news crews and damaged their equipment and vehicles.<ref name="hkfp_20191101_refuseinjunction" /><ref name="scmp_3037033" /> Protesters also placed political pressure on various corporations, urging them to stop placing advertisements on TVB.<ref name="Hj3m9" />

On the other hand, [[Radio Television Hong Kong]] (RTHK), a public broadcasting service, faced criticisms of bias in favour of the protest movement. Its critics have surrounded the headquarters of RTHK and assaulted its reporters.<ref name="bauxc" /> RTHK also faced political pressure from the police directly: police commissioner Chris Tang filed complaints to RTHK against the satirical TV show ''[[Headliner (TV programme)|Headliner]]'' and opinion program ''Pentaprism'' for "insulting the police" and "spreading hate speech" respectively.{{efn|''Headliner'' had a segment that poked fun at the police.

Police raided the headquarters of pro-democratic newspaper ''Apple Daily'' and searched its editorial and reporters' areas on 10 August 2020. During the operation, reporters from several major news outlets were rejected from entering cordoned-off areas where a scheduled press briefing was held.

[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]

Official statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name="bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed" /> Retail sales declined and consumer spending decreased.<ref name="scmp_3017580" /> Some restaurants saw their customers cancel bookings, and certain banks and shops were forced to close their doors. Some supply chains were disrupted because of the protests. Lower consumer spending caused several luxury brands to delay shop openings, while other brands quit.<ref name="scmp3038400" /> Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name="scmp_3014240" /> Stock of protest supplies ran low in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name="asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks" />

The protests also affected property owners: Fearing the instability, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. Demand for property also declined, as overall property transactions dropped by 24 per cent when compared with the Umbrella Revolution; Property developers were forced to slash prices.<ref name="scmp_3024412" /> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name="scmp_3037982" /> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8 per cent from 9&nbsp;June 2019 to late August 2019. As investment sentiment waned, companies awaiting listing on the stock market put their [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) on hold, there being only one in August 2019 – the lowest since 2012. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the "one country, two systems" principle; the outlook on the territory was similarly downgraded from "stable" to "negative".<ref name="scmp_3026109" />

Tourism was also affected: the number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong in August 2019 declined by 40 per cent compared to a year earlier,<ref name="reuters_20190909_40%plunge" /> while the [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]] holiday saw a decline of 31.9 per cent.<ref name="cnn_20191010_holidaydip" />{{Better source needed|date=October 2020}} Unemployment increased from 0.1 per cent to 3.2 per cent from September to November 2019, with the tourist and the catering sectors, seeing rises to 5.2 per cent and 6.2 per cent respectively during the same period, being the hardest hit.<ref name="20191217reuters" /> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing services.<ref name="scmp_3038102" /> During the airport protests on 12 and 13&nbsp;August 2019, the Airport Authority cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name="cna_11842026" /> Various countries issued travel warnings to their citizens concerning Hong Kong, and many mainland Chinese tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns.<ref name="bbc_49276259" />

[[File:西營盤山城和你宵 20200118.jpg|thumb|District Councilors collaborated with shops supporting the [[Yellow Economic Circle]] to organise a [[Lunar New Year Fair]] in Sai Ying Pun on 18 January.<ref name="20200121hongkongfp" />]]

The economy in Hong Kong became increasingly politicised. Some corporations bowed to pressure and fired employees who expressed their support for the protests.<ref name="theatlantic596869" /><ref name="20190828theguardian" /> Several international corporations and businesses including the [[National Basketball Association]] and [[Activision Blizzard]] decided to appease China during the protests and faced intense criticisms.<ref name="vox20910039" /> ''[[The Diplomat]]'' called the Yellow Economic Circle "one of the most radical, progressive, and innovative forms of long-term struggle" during the protests.<ref name="20191213thediplomat" /> Corporations perceived to be pro-Beijing faced boycotts, and some were vandalised.<ref name="20191108asiatimes" /> Meanwhile, "yellow" shops allied with protesters enjoyed a flurry of patrons even during the coronavirus crisis.<ref name="20200501reuters" />

===Governance===
[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] was criticised for its performance during the protests – her perceived arrogance and obstinacy,<ref name="standardhk_129761" /><ref name="disparity" /> and her reluctance to engage in dialogue with protesters. Her extended absences, stonewalling performance at press conferences,<ref name="ft_20190830_policefurious" /> were all believed to have enabled the protesters to escalate events.<ref name="hkfp_20190707_missingleader" />{{efn|At a press conference on 5&nbsp;August 2019, Lam explained her absence from the public eye in the preceding two weeks. She was concerned about the risk to organisers over the possible disruption by protestors of public events and press conferences.<ref name="scmp_3021459" />}} According to public opinion polls, Lam's approval rating plunged to 22.3 in October 2019, the lowest among all chief executives. Her performance and those of [[Secretary for Security]] John Lee and [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Teresa Cheng (politician)|Teresa Cheng]] were called "disastrous".<ref name="hkfp_20191009_ratingplunges" /> On 2 September, [[Reuters]] received a leaked audio recording in which Carrie Lam admitted that she had "very limited" room to manoeuvre between the Central People's Government and Hong Kong, and that she would quit, if she had a choice.<ref name="6Fl0Z" /> However, the next day she told the media that she had never contemplated discussing her resignation with the Beijing authorities.<ref name="GBMEX" /> Lam's behaviour on this and later occasions strengthened the perception among a broad part of the protesters and their supporters that she was not able to make any crucial decision without instructions from the Beijing government, effectively serving as its [[puppet]].<ref name="TJMFp" /> Distrust toward the government and the lack of police accountability also led to the temporary prevalence of [[conspiracy theories]].<ref name="trust vacuum" />

Both sides claimed that [[rule of law]] in Hong Kong was undermined during the protests. While the government, the police and government supporters criticised the protesters for breaking the law and using violence to "extort" the government to accept the demands, the protesters and their sympathizers felt that lack of police oversight, selective law enforcement, selective prosecution, police brutality, and the government's blanket denial of all police wrongdoings all harmed rule of law and expressed their disappointment that the law cannot help them achieve justice.<ref name="ii2kU" /> The judiciary was also scrutinised after judge [[Kwok Wai-kin]] expressed sympathy to a stabber who attacked three people in September 2019 near a Lennon Wall. He was later removed from handling all protest-related cases.<ref name="0IF50" />

The government's extended absence and its lack of a political solution in the early stage of the protests catapulted the police into the front line, and heavy-handed policing became a substitute for solving a political crisis.<ref name="2ZQE2" /> The police force was initially "lost and confused" and was discontent with the government for not offering enough support.<ref name="reuters_20190717_underpressure" /> Subsequently, Lam's blanket denial of allegations of police brutality led to accusations that Lam and her administration endorsed police violence.<ref name="Lam on brutality" /> Throughout the protests, the establishment waited for demonstrators' aggression to increase so they could justify greater militarisation of the police and dismiss the protesters as "insurgents" and thereby also dismiss their demands.<ref name="diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric" /> [[Ma Ngok]], a political scientist, remarked that the failures of the government meant that it "has lost the trust of a whole generation" and predicted that youths would remain angry at both the government and the police for years to come.<ref name="guardian_20190811_lacktrust" />

The reputation of the police took a serious drubbing following the heavy-handed treatment of protesters.<ref name="hkfp_20190625_policeconfusion" /><ref name="standardhk_132961" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Hong Kong's ranking in global law and order index plunges from fifth place to 82nd on the heels of last year's unrest |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3107646/hong-kongs-ranking-global-law-and-order-index-plunges |accessdate=30 October 2020}}</ref> In October 2019, a survey conducted by CUHK revealed that more than 50 per cent of respondents were deeply dissatisfied with the police's performance.<ref name="independent_9158061" /> According to some reports, their aggressive behaviours and tactics have caused them to become a symbol that represents hostility and suppression. Their actions against protesters resulted in a breakdown of citizens' trust of the police.<ref name="aljazeera_191101070008742" /><ref name="atlantic_597205" /><ref name="hkfp_20180628_lostgoodwill" /> Citizens were also concerned over the ability of the police to regulate and control their members and feared their abuse of power.<ref name="hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons" /> The suspected acts of police brutality led some politically neutral or political apathetic citizens to become more sympathetic towards the young protesters.<ref name="wsj_11567458226" /> Fearing Hong Kong was changing into a [[police state]], some citizens actively considered emigration.<ref name="cnn_20191008_hkleave" /> The lack of any prosecutions against officers, and the absence of independent police oversight, sparked fears that the police could not be held accountable for their actions and that they were immune to any legal consequences.<ref name="WPost Police misconduct" />

Affected by the controversies surrounding the police force's handling of the protests, between June 2019 to February 2020, 446 police officers quit (which was 40 per cent higher than the figure in 2018), and the force only managed to recruit 760 officers (40 per cent lower than the previous year), falling well short of the police force's expectations.<ref name="police rep" /> The police cancelled foot patrols because of fears officers may be attacked,<ref name="scmp_3025140" /> and issued extendable batons to off-duty officers.<ref name="hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons" /> Police officers also reported being "physically and mentally" tired, as they faced the risks of being doxed, cyberbullied, and distanced by their family members.<ref name="cnn_20190815_policeside" /> Police relations with journalists,<ref name="scmp_3017673" /> social workers,<ref name="hkfp_20191102_socialworkers" /><ref>{{cite news |title=Social worker jailed one year for obstructing police |url=https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1532621-20200617.htm#:~:text=A%20social%20worker%20has%20been,in%20Yuen%20Long%20last%20July |accessdate=29 October 2020}}</ref> medical professionals<ref name="hkfp_20190828_doctorsstand" /> and members from other disciplined forces<ref name="hkfp_20191111_civilservicerifts" /> became strained.

===Society===
The protests deepened the rift between the "yellow" (pro-democracy) and "blue" (pro-government) camps created since the Umbrella Revolution. People who opposed the protests argued that protesters were spreading "chaos and fear" across the city, causing damage to the economy and thus harming people not involved in the protests. On the other hand, protesters justified their actions by what they saw as the greater good of protecting the territory's freedoms against the encroachment of mainland China.<ref name="cnn_20191026_hadenough" /> Anti-mainland sentiments swelled during this period.<ref name="20191030reuters" /> Family relationships were strained, as children argued with their parents over their attending protests, either because they felt that the protests reflected outdated values, or they disagreed with their parent's political stance or the manner of the protests.<ref name="aljazeera_19092111251102" />

[[File:190717 Silver-hair elderly rally.jpg|thumb|Elderly marching on 17&nbsp;July to support young people's anti-extradition bill protests]]
As the protests continued to escalate, citizens showed an increasing tolerance towards confrontational and violent actions.<ref name="inmediahk_1067950" /> Pollsters found that among 8,000 respondents, 90% of them believed that the use of these tactics was understandable because of the government's refusal to respond to the demands.<ref name="hkfp_20190920_supportradical" /> The protest movement enabled the citizens of Hong Kong to become better equipped to challenge the government when its policies were perceived to be controversial, such as those during the Wuhan coronavirus crisis.<ref name="vox21124157" /><ref>{{cite web |title=How Hong Kong Did It |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/05/how-hong-kong-beating-coronavirus/611524/ |accessdate=29 October 2020}}</ref> Unity among the protesters was seen across a wide spectrum of age groups and professions.{{efn|Middle-aged and elderly volunteers attempting to separate the police and the young protesters in the frontline and providing various forms of assistance.<ref name="guardian_20190913_volunteersprotect" /> Various professions organised rallies to stand in solidarity with protesters.

This was evidenced by the adoption of "Glory to Hong Kong" as a protest anthem.<ref name="caught fire" />

A study conducted by the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the protests were having negative impacts on the [[mental health]] of Hong Kong residents with one third of adults, around 2&nbsp;million adults of a total population of 7.4&nbsp;million, reporting symptoms of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) during the protests, up from 5 per cent in March 2015.<ref name="lJEc5" /> This was a six times increase from four years earlier with levels of depression and PTSD comparable to a war zone.<ref name="6REnX" /><ref name="v38tL" /> A survey, on social media, of more than 1,000 people by the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] found that 38 per cent were troubled by depression-related problems.<ref name="I7fGD" /> Symptoms of PTSD were found not only to afflict protesters, but also those watching events unfold on the news, living in affected areas, or working in jobs that are related to the movement (nurses, doctors, reporters, police, and street cleaners).<ref name="z3x84" /> Suspected PTSD in 2019 was found to have a prevalence of 12.8 per cent in the population.

Carrie Lam continued to push for the second reading of the bill despite a mass anti-extradition bill protest, saying that the government was "duty-bound" to amend the law.<ref name="scmp_3011931" /><ref name="hkfp_20190604_noreason" /> She had previously rejected meeting the protesters, believing that such meeting would have "no purpose".<ref name="Lam Responds">{{cite web|url=https://hongkongfp.com/2020/09/04/from-defensive-to-apologies-to-doubling-down-how-carrie-lams-response-to-hong-kongs-protest-movement-evolved-over-a-year/|title=From defensive, to apologies, to doubling down: How Carrie Lam's response to Hong Kong's protest movement evolved over a year|first=Kelly|last=Ho|work=[[Hong Kong Free Press]]|date=September 4, 2020|access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref> Following the 12&nbsp;June conflict, both Police Commissioner Stephen Lo and Lam characterised the conflict as a "riot". The police later backed down on the claim, saying that among the protesters, only five of them rioted. Protesters demanded that the government fully retract the riot characterisation.<ref name="hkfp_20190618_backdown" /> Lam's analogy as Hong Kong people's mother attracted criticisms after the violent crackdown on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name="standardhk_129667" /><ref name="Lam Responds" />

Lam announced the suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June 2019,<ref name="scmp_3014669" /> and officially apologised to the public on 18&nbsp;June two days after another massive march.<ref name="hkfp_20190618_sincereapologies" /> In early July, Lam reiterated that the bill "had passed away" and reaffirmed that all efforts to amend the law had ceased, though her use of language was thought to be ambiguous.<ref name="guardian_20190709_deadbill" /> During July and August 2019, the government insisted that it would not make any concessions and that the IPCC would suffice to investigate police misconduct. She also refused to declare the withdrawal of the bill, and ignored calls for her to resign.<ref name="scmp_3017795" /><ref name="coconutshk_20190709" /> On 4&nbsp;September 2019, Lam announced that she would formally withdraw the extradition bill, as well as introduce measures such as adding new members to the IPCC, engage in dialogue at the community level, and invite academics to join an "independent review committee" – with no investigative powers – to evaluate Hong Kong's deep-rooted problems. However, protesters and democrats saw the withdrawal as coming too late,<ref name="hkfp_20190904_toolittle" /> and insisted that all of their five core demands be answered.<ref name="hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn" /> One day prior to the first dialogue session of Lam on 26&nbsp;September 2019, a Chinese envoy termed the demands "political blackmail", leading to doubts on the leeway Lam had in the sessions.<ref name="guardian_20190926_dialoguesession" />

After condemning the protesters who had stormed the legislature on 1&nbsp;July for their "use of extreme violence",<ref name="hkfp_20190702_condemnsoccupation" /> and those who had defaced the national emblem during the 21&nbsp;July protest,<ref name="coconutshk_20190722" /> Lam suggested in early August 2019 that the protests had deviated from their original purpose and that their goal now was to challenge China's sovereignty and damage "one country, two systems".<ref name="scmp_3021459" /> She suggested that radical protesters were dragging Hong Kong to a "path of no return"<ref name="scmp_3021459" /> and that they had "no stake in society", and therefore, government meetings need not to include them.<ref name="scmp_3022180" /><ref name="Lam Responds" /> On 5&nbsp;October 2019, after what Lam referred to as "extreme violence" had taken place, an emergency law from the colonial era was enacted to ban face masks in Hong Kong—without declaring a [[state of emergency]]—which sparked criticism from various human rights organisations.<ref name="reuters_20191005_defyban" />{{efn|The democrats filed a [[judicial review]] to challenge Lam's decision,<ref name="hkfp_20191005_challengeban" /> and the [[High Court of Hong Kong|High Court]] ruled that the mask ban was unconstitutional.<ref name="rthk_1492951" /> In April 2020, after the government had filed an appeal, the court ruled that the ban is only unconstitutional during legal demonstrations, and ruled that the police cannot physically remove the face masks worn by violators.<ref name="scmp3079197" />}} Starting from October, Lam regularly referred to the protesters as "rioters" and dismissed the protesters, despite them amassing mass support, throughout late 2019.<ref name="Lam Responds" /> She also allied with the police, and claimed that ending violence and restoring order, rather than responding to political demands, was what people wanted in Hong Kong.<ref name="Lam Responds" />

To cope with the ongoing protests, on 15&nbsp;November 2019, the police had appointed no more than 100 [[Correctional Services Department]] (CSD) officers as special constables to assist them.<ref name="scmp_3038039" /> In May 2020, the authorities announced they would recruit more personnel from the other five [[Hong Kong Disciplined Services|disciplinary services]] and bring the total number of special constables to 700.<ref name="scmp3086557" /> Several protesters who were detained at a correctional facility in [[Pik Uk]] reported that they had been tortured and physically abused by guards. They reported that the guards beat their hands and feet, slapped their face, then forced them to slap themselves after they were taken to a room without security camera during their time in detention.<ref name="rthk20200505" />

According to [[Reuters]], the government contacted eight [[public relation]]s firms to improve the image of the government in late September 2019, but six of them declined to participate for fear that partnering with the HKSAR government may tarnish their reputation.<ref name="20200912reuters" /> On 30 July 2020, the Hong Kong government made ineligible a dozen pro-democracy candidates from running in Legislative Council elections which had been scheduled for 6 September; the elections were later [[Postponement of the 2020 Hong Kong legislative election|postponed]] by a year, for which the government cited a new [[COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong|surge in COVID-19 cases]] as reason.

The pro-Beijing camp supported the government in promoting the bill, though [[flip-flop (politics)|U-turned]] when the government withdrew the bill.<ref name="eji_20190620" /> They condemned the use of violence by protesters, including breaking into the LegCo Complex and using petrol bombs and unidentified liquids against the police,<ref name="rthk_1466047" /><ref name="standardhk_211229_violentactions" /> and used the term "rubbish youths" ({{zh|links=no|c=廢青}}) to refer to high school- and university-age participants.<ref name="scmp_1866535" /> They maintained their support for the Hong Kong Police Force and held various counter-demonstrations to support them,<ref name="rthk_1468821" /><ref name="rthk_1468634" /><ref name="inmediahk_1065744" /> and criticised the government for not taking enough actions to "halt the violence".<ref name="jWuw5" /> Members of the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]], [[Ip Kwok-him]] and [[Regina Ip]] alleged that there was a "mastermind" behind the protests but could not provide substantial evidence to support their claim.<ref name="eji_20190809" />

Many lawmakers from the pan-democratic camp, such as Ted Hui and Roy Kwong, assisted the protesters in various scenarios.<ref name="time_5628021" /> Responding to the escalation of the mid-August protests at the airport, the convenor of the pro-democratic caucas, [[Claudia Mo]], while disagreeing with some protesters' actions, asserted that her group of lawmakers would not split with the protesters.<ref name="rfa_20190814_airportreopens" /><ref name="hk01_363679_protestersaware" /><ref name="standnews_20190715_roadblock" /> Pro-democrats also condemned the arrests of and the violence directed at the protests' organisers, lawmakers and election candidates.<ref name="independent_9183101" /> Former government executives, including [[Anson Chan]], the former [[Chief Secretary for Administration]], issued several open letters to Carrie Lam, urging her to respond to the five core demands raised by protesters.<ref name="hkfp_20190724_secondappeal" />

In August, 17 members from the [[Real Estate Developers Association of Hong Kong]] and the [[Chinese General Chamber of Commerce]] released statements condemning the escalating protests because of the instability they had brought to the city's economy and business community, as well as the negative effects on society as a whole.<ref name="standardhk_210500" /> [[Annie Wu (businesswoman)|Annie Wu]], the daughter of Maxim's founder and also a member of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]], condemned the protesters at the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] and suggested that Hong Kong should give up the "lost" protesters.<ref name="thestandard213241" /><ref name="5Lh0c" /> On 30&nbsp;October, [[Abraham Shek]], a lawmaker representing the [[Real Estate and Construction (constituency)|Real Estate and Construction constituency]], supported the formation of an independent commission and said that the problem could not be resolved by addressing the severe housing shortage.<ref name="hkfp_20191030_independentprobe" /> Tycoon [[Li Ka-shing]] took out a two-page advertisement in newspapers, urging people to "stop anger and violence in the name of love", and quoting a Chinese poem: "The melon of Huangtai cannot bear the picking again".<ref name="scmp_3023037" />

Despite the government, the pro-Beijing camp and state media invoking the notion of a "[[silent majority]]" who opposed the protests, and urging citizens to cut ties with the "violent protesters", citizens generally favoured the pro-democratic camp and supported the protest movement.<ref name="20191126newstatesman" /> The 2019 Hong Kong District Council election, the first poll since the beginning of the protests, had been billed as a "referendum" on the government.<ref name="nbc_1090206" /> More than 2.94&nbsp;million votes were cast for a turnout rate of 71.2%, up from 1.45&nbsp;million and 47% from the previous election.<ref name="aljazeera_191124051609941" /> This was the highest turnout in Hong Kong's history, both in absolute numbers and in turnout rates.<ref name="euronews_20191124_electionpolls" /> The [[Results breakdown of the 2019 Hong Kong local elections|results]] were a resounding [[landslide victory]] for the pro-democracy bloc, as they saw their seat share increased from 30% to almost 88%, with a jump in vote share from 40% to 57%.<ref name="euronews_20191124_electionpolls" /> Among those who were also legislators, the overwhelming majority of the losing candidates were from the pro-Beijing bloc.<ref name="rthk_1494247" />

===Mainland China reactions===
{{further|National People's Congress decision on Hong Kong national security legislation}}

The Chinese government expressed their opposition to the protests, while taking measures against the protests and their supporters. The protests were depicted by the government and media as separatist riots.<ref name="reuters_20190610_foreignforces" /> Beijing accused the movement of displaying "characteristics of [[colour revolution]]s" and "signs of terrorism".<ref name="scmp_3021877" /><ref name="eji_20190813_beijing" /> The Beijing government and state-run media accused foreign forces of interfering with domestic affairs and supporting the protesters.<ref name="hkfp_20190910_joushuagerman" /> These allegations were rejected by Hong Kong pro-democrats,<ref name="hkfp_20190808_colourrevolution" /> and [[CNN]] noted that China had a record of blaming foreign forces for causing domestic unrest.<ref name="cnn_20190731_usblamed" /> On 22&nbsp;October 2019, following protests and violence in [[2019 Catalan protests|Catalonia]] and [[2019 Chilean protests|Chile]], the Chinese government accused Western media of hypocrisy for not providing similar coverage and support to those protests.<ref name="cnn_20191021_chilespain" /><ref name="cna_12025908" /> Chinese diplomats and ambassadors in more than 70 countries broadcast Beijing's position on the protests to shape international opinion.<ref name="scmp3026465" /> General Secretary Xi Jinping and [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Li Keqiang]] have repeatedly backed [[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] and the police.<ref name="sau2J" />

Chinese state media outlets largely ignored the protests until 17&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name="hkfp_20190716_chinapropaganda" /> The protests were mostly [[Internet censorship in China|censored from Mainland Chinese]] social media, such as [[Sina Weibo]], though state-owned media and Chinese social media users later condemned the protesters.<ref name="ft_20190610_newscensored" /> State-run media pressured various companies, including railway operator MTR Corporation and airline [[Cathay Pacific]] to take a hardline approach against employees who took part in the protests. Cathay Pacific saw its top managers "reshuffled" and began firing pro-democratic employees after the [[Civil Aviation Administration of China]] threatened to block Cathay's access to Chinese airspace,<ref name="scmp_3022284" /> while the MTR began to close stations and end its service early after being criticised for transporting protesters.<ref name="scmp_3027064" /><ref name="cnbc_20191008" /><ref name="hollywood_1245783" /> Chinese media also attempted to appeal to the "silent majority"<ref name="20190805straitstimes" /> and blame the protests on [[Education in Hong Kong|Hong Kong's education system]].<ref name="20190924telegraph" /> It also hailed police officers as "heroes",<ref name="scmp3021987" /> and demanded the government take more "forceful" actions and the court to hand out heavy punishments,<ref name="scmp3031814" /><ref name="scmp3020454" />

Foreign envoys reported the deployment in late August of a sizeable number of [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) troops to Hong Kong, well beyond the usual rotation and possibly doubling the number of PLA troops than before the start of the protests. Drills by the [[People's Armed Police]] were observed across the border in Shenzhen in August.<ref name="reuters_20190930_doublestroop" /> On 6&nbsp;October 2019, the PLA issued its first warning to the protesters, who were shining laser lights on the exterior of the PLA garrison in [[Kowloon Tong]].<ref name="reuters_20191006_laserbarracks" /> On 16 November, soldiers appeared publicly in the streets for the first time during the protests, in plain clothes and unarmed, to clear roadblocks and other debris left during protests alongside local residents, firefighters, and police officers before marching back to the Kowloon Tong barracks. The government insisted the soldiers were volunteers, and that it had made no request for assistance.<ref name="scmp_3038049" /> The act was criticised by pro-democrats who deemed it a violation of the Basic Law.<ref name="rthk_1492648" /> The Chinese government required goods mailed from mainland China to Hong Kong to be investigated while goods which were believed to relate to the protests were blocked.<ref name="scmp_3033312" /><ref name="reuters_20191018_blackclothing" /> Chinese authorities also detained several individuals in mainland China after they voiced their support for the protesters.<ref name="CLfbQ" />

China further tightened its control in Hong Kong in 2020: on 4&nbsp;January, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] dismissed [[Wang Zhimin]] from the role of director of the Hong Kong Liaison Office and appointed [[Luo Huining]] as his successor. The decision was widely linked to the poor performance of pro-government candidates at the District Council elections in November, and Wang's perceived poor judgment of how the protests evolved.<ref name="scmp_3044684" /><ref name="nyt_20190104_replacement" /> [[Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office]] director [[Zhang Xiaoming]] was demoted and replaced by [[Xia Baolong]] in February 2020.<ref name="9KjjJ" /> The new directors triggered the [[Hong Kong Basic Law#Controversy|Basic Law Article 22 controversy]] in April when they claimed that the two offices were not covered by Article&nbsp;22.<ref name="nC4Je" /> In May, China announced that the NPCSC, China's [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber-stamp]] legislative body, would directly draft a national security law for Hong Kong and skip the local legislation procedures.<ref name="l2hYc" /> Political analysts believed that Beijing's action would mark the end of the "[[one country, two systems]]" principle and Hong Kong's autonomy as promised in the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]].<ref name="Z19zk" /><ref name="eDi1P" /> On 28 May 2020, the NPC approved the controversial national security laws for Hong Kong. The legislation allows the government's national security agencies to operate in Hong Kong.<ref name="ODHRD" /> On 30 June 2020, China implemented "Hong Kong national security law". Its 66 articles target crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, and includes serious penalties between 10 years of prison to life [[imprisonment]].<ref name="i6D2y" />

Some protesters fled to Taiwan to avoid prosecution.<ref name="rthk-exiled" /> The Hong Kong protests were considered a contributing factor in the landslide victory of [[Tsai Ing-wen]] during the [[2020 Taiwanese presidential election]]. Tsai, who had repeatedly shown a supportive attitude toward the Hong Kong protesters, used the slogan "today Hong Kong, tomorrow Taiwan" during her presidential campaign, referring to the city's unrest as evidence of the threats posed by the "one country, two systems" principle to Taiwan's autonomy and democracy.<ref name="ft-taiwan-election" /> Christina Lai from [[Academia Sinica]] concurred that the situation in Hong Kong created a sense of "urgency" for Taiwanese voters, as China's hardline reaction implied that they would use the same strategy to undermine Taiwan's autonomy in the future. Tsai's rejection of the principle enabled her to gain support from young voters.<ref name="ML47Z" />

In the United States, the House of Representatives and [[United States Senate|Senate]] both unanimously passed the [[Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act]] in light of the extradition bill and protests.<ref name="reuters_20191114_quickpassage" /><ref name="bloomberg_20191119_senatebill" /><ref name="wsj_11574205044" /><ref name="reuters_20191119_senatebill" /> President [[Donald Trump]] signed the bill on 27&nbsp;November, alongside a companion bill restricting US exports of crowd control devices to the Hong Kong police forces.<ref name="cnbc_20191127_trumpbill" /> Various US politicians have expressed disapproval of corporate decisions related to the protests.<ref name="bi_20191008_nbaoffense" /><ref name="hill_464748" /><ref name="vox_20808691" /><ref name="time_5653973" /> On 29 May 2020, Trump ordered the removal of the special status enjoyed by Hong Kong due to Beijing's new national security law for the territory, after Pompeo declared that the city was no longer autonomous from China and should therefore, be treated as any one of Chinese cities.<ref name="YV3hH" />

[[Dominic Raab]], the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] of the United Kingdom, urged China to uphold the promises it made in the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], which was a legally binding international treaty.<ref name="1t0E6" /> The UK had already stopped selling crowd control equipment to the HKPF.<ref name="BWB8i" /> Former UK consulate employee [[Simon Cheng]] was granted asylum in the UK in June 2020. He was previously detained by Chinese authorities who reportedly tortured him to force a confession that the UK was involved in instigating the protests, though Chinese authorities stated that he was detained for "soliciting prostitutes".<ref name="4Zo55" /> On 3 June 2020, Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] announced that if China were to continue pursuing the national security law, he would open a path to British citizenship for Hong Kong residents who were eligible for a [[British National (Overseas)]] passport (BNO).<ref name="603Zg" /> After the passing of the law on 30 June 2020, the UK confirmed these Hong Kong residents are able to come to the United Kingdom with a five-year limited leave to remain.<ref name="HMaXR" /> Following those five years they will be able to apply for [[indefinite leave to remain|indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom]] and, after a further 12 months with settled status, they will be able to apply for [[British nationality law|British citizenship]].<ref name="fZJkH" />

[[United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Michelle Bachelet]] demanded the Hong Kong government conduct an investigation into police use of force against the protesters;<ref>{{cite news |title=China accuses UN human rights chief of inflaming Hong Kong unrest |url=https://www.dw.com/en/china-accuses-un-human-rights-chief-of-inflaming-hong-kong-unrest/a-51486730 |access-date=29 November 2020}}</ref> she previously said that she was "troubled and alarmed" by the escalating violence used by the protesters.<ref name="hkfp_20191006_unchief" /> Amnesty International praised the protesters for their dedication despite facing "abusive policing tactics" which include the "wanton use of tear gas, arbitrary arrests, physical assaults and abuses in detention".<ref name="scmp3048110" /> [[Kenneth Roth]], the head of [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW), was denied entry to Hong Kong at Hong Kong International Airport on 12&nbsp;January 2020. Hong Kong officials insisted that the decision to bar Roth from entry had been made in Hong Kong, not in mainland China.<ref name="hkfp_20200114_hrwdeniedentry" /> In June 2020, on the first anniversary of mass protests in Hong Kong, a statement released by HRW said that the governments of both China and Hong Kong should respect fundamental rights of people.<ref name="wnInG" />

Norwegian lawmaker [[Guri Melby]],<ref name="EKfkc" /> and US members of Congress [[Marco Rubio]] and [[Jim McGovern (American politician)|James McGovern]] announced their intention to nominate the Hong Kong protesters for the Nobel Peace Prize in October 2019 and February 2020 respectively.<ref name="20200205bloomberg" />
