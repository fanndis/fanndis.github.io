Rajiv Gandhi was campaigning for the upcoming elections along with G.K.moopanar in southern states of India. On 21 May, after campaigning in Visakhapatnam, his next stop was Sriperumbudur, [[Tamil Nadu]]. About two hours after arriving in [[Madras]] (now Chennai), Rajiv Gandhi was driven by motorcade in a white [[Hindustan Ambassador|Ambassador car]] to [[Sriperumbudur]], stopping along the way at a few other election campaigning venues.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/22/world/assassination-india-rajiv-gandhi-assassinated-bombing-campaign-stop-india-puts.html?scp=2&sq=rajiv%20gandhi%20crossette&st=cse "Assassination in India; Rajiv Gandhi is assassinated in bombing at campaign stop"], by Barbara Crossette, ''The New York Times'', 22 May 1991.

Along the way, he was [[garland]]ed by many well-wishers, Congress party workers and school children. The assassin, Dhanu (Thenmozhi Rajaratnam), approached and greeted him.

==Security lapses==
The Supreme Court held that the decision to eliminate Gandhi was precipitated by his interview to ''Sunday'' magazine (21–28 August 1990), where he stated that he would send the IPKF to disarm the LTTE if he returned to power. Gandhi also defended the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka accord in the same interview. The LTTE decision to kill him was perhaps aimed at preventing him from coming to power again. Thereafter, the Justice J S Verma Commission was formed to look 
into the security lapses that contributed to the killing.

The final report, submitted in June 1992, concluded that the security arrangements for the former PM were adequate but that the local Congress party leaders disrupted and broke these arrangements.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patel|first=Tejas|title=Rajiv assassination mystery unsolved|url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/showcolumns.aspx?id=COLEN20070012787|work=Article|publisher=NDTV.com|access-date=21 May 2011}}</ref>

The [[P. V. Narasimha Rao|Narasimha Rao]] government initially rejected Verma's findings but later accepted it under pressure. However, no action was taken on the recommendations of the commission.

Despite no action, the findings raised vital questions that have previously been consistently raised by political analysts. Sources have indicated that Gandhi was repeatedly informed that there was a threat to his life and that he should not travel to Tamil Nadu. In fact, the then governor of Tamil Nadu Bhism Narayan Singh, broke official protocol and twice warned Gandhi about the threat to his life if he visited the state.

Dr Subramanian Swamy said in his book, ''Sri Lanka in Crisis: India's Options (2007)'', that an LTTE delegation had met Rajiv Gandhi on 5 March 1991. Another delegation met him around 14 March 1991 in New Delhi.

Journalist Ram Bahadur Rai wrote that:
<blockquote>The message conveyed to Rajiv Gandhi by both these delegations was that there was no threat to his life and that he can travel to Tamil Nadu without fearing for his life. I did a series of articles after his assassination that pointed out how, after these meetings, Rajiv became complacent about his security and broke security rules in more than 40 rallies.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patel|first=Tejas|title=Rajiv assassination mystery unsolved|url=http://www.asiantribune.com/node/5839|work=Article|publisher=Asian Tribune|access-date=21 May 2011}}</ref></blockquote>

==Funeral==
[[File:Rajiv Gandhi Memorial path.jpg|left|240px|thumb|Known as the "Path of Light", this was the path that Gandhi took before being assassinated]]
Following his assassination, Rajiv Gandhi's mutilated body was airlifted to [[New Delhi]]. From the [[Indira Gandhi International Airport|Palam airport]], his body was sent to the [[All India Institute of Medical Sciences]] in [[New Delhi]] for an autopsy, reconstruction and embalming.<ref name="rajivgandhifuneral">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SAZVQqntxY0C&q=rajiv+gandhi+body+reconstructed&pg=PA70 |title=Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi&nbsp;— Shashi Ahluwalia, Meenakshi Ahluwalia |isbn=9788170993155 |access-date=2013-01-19|last1=Ahluwalia |first1=Meenakshi |date=January 1991 }}</ref>

A [[state funeral]] was held for Rajiv Gandhi on 24 May 1991. His funeral was broadcast live nationally and internationally, and was attended by dignitaries from over 60 countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publishyourarticles.net/knowledge-hub/essay/assassination-of-rajiv-gandhi-and-its-aftermath-essay.html |title=Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi and its aftermath |publisher=Knowledge Hub |date=1991-05-21 |access-date=2013-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430204658/http://www.publishyourarticles.net/knowledge-hub/essay/assassination-of-rajiv-gandhi-and-its-aftermath-essay.html |archive-date=2013-04-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was cremated on the banks of the river [[Yamuna river|Yamuna]], near the cremation spot of his [[Indira Gandhi|mother]], [[Sanjay Gandhi|brother]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru|grandfather]].

==Investigation==
Immediately after the assassination, the [[Chandra Shekhar|Chandrasekhar]] government handed the investigation over to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] on 22 May 1991. The agency created a special investigation team under [[D. R. Karthikeyan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesnacademy.ac.in/board-of-governors-karthikeyan.html|title=Profile of D.R.Karthikeyan|website=www.thesnacademy.ac.in}}</ref> to determine who was responsible for the assassination. The SIT probe confirmed the role of the LTTE in the assassination,<ref name=sit>{{cite web|last1=Subramanian|first1=T.S|title=A mystery solved|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1611/16111060.htm|website=www.frontline.in|publisher=Frontline|access-date=10 Aug 2014}}</ref> which was upheld by the Supreme Court of India.<ref name=raj>{{cite news|last1=Keerthana|first1=R|title=Rajiv's death – a revisit|url=http://www.thehindu.com/in-school/rajivs-death-a-revisit/article5814423.ece|access-date=10 Aug 2014|publisher=The Hindu|date=21 Mar 2014}}</ref>

The interim report of Justice Milap Chand Jain, looking into the conspiracy angle to the assassination, indicted the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|DMK]] for colluding with the LTTE. The report concluded that the DMK had provided sanctuary to the LTTE, which made it easier for the rebels to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi.<ref name=raj/>

The Commission report stated that the year 1989 signified "the perpetuation of the general political trend of indulging the Tamil militants on Indian soil and tolerance of their wide-ranging criminal and anti-national activities". The report also alleged that LTTE leaders in Jaffna were in possession of sensitive coded messages exchanged between the Union government and the state government of DMK. "There is evidence to show that, during this period, some of the most vital wireless messages were passed between the LTTE operatives based in Tamil Nadu and Jaffna. These messages, which were decoded later, are directly related to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi", the report stated. The Congress subsequently brought down the United Front (UF) government of I K Gujral after the report was leaked in November 1998. The party also demanded the removal of DMK from the UF government, arguing that it had played a key role in the death of Rajiv Gandhi.

==Perpetrator==
[[File:Thenmozhi Rajaratnam.jpg|thumb|Thenmozhi Rajaratnam]]
The assassination was carried out by Thenmozhi Rajaratnam, also known as Dhanu, also known as Kalaivani Rajaratnam.<ref name="books.google.co.in"/><!-- As her date of birth is disputed, please add a citation if you want to add a date of birth to this article --> She was a member of the Sri Lankan Tamil militant group [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (Tamil Tigers). Thenmozhi was the daughter of a Sri Lankan Tamil man named Rajaratnam. Rajaratnam had predeceased Thenmozhi by sixteen years. Thenmozhi was survived by her mother, brother Sivavarman and two sisters.<ref name="books.google.co.in"/> Thenmozhi was 17 years old when she carried out the assassination.

The court convicted and sentenced the seven persons who facilitated the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi to life imprisonment. They are currently undergoing life imprisonment in prisons in India. They are:

* Santhan alias T. Suthenthiraraja - a Sri Lankan national.
* Nalini - an Indian citizen. Nalini is the wife of Murugan (alias Sriharan).
* Murugan alias Sriharan - a Sri Lankan national.
* A.G. Perarivalan,
* Robert Pious - a Sri Lankan national.
* Jayakumar - the brother in law of Robert Pious.
* Ravichandran - a Sri Lankan national.<ref>https://www.firstpost.com/india/rajiv-gandhi-murder-who-are-the-7-convicts-the-tn-govt-wants-to-free-1398193.html</ref><br/>

==Supreme Court judgment==
As per the [[Supreme Court of India]] judgment, by [[K. T. Thomas (Justice)|Judge K. T. Thomas]], the killing was carried out due to personal animosity of the LTTE chief [[Prabhakaran]] towards [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. Additionally, the Rajiv Gandhi administration had antagonised other Tamil militant organisations like [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam|PLOTE]] for [[1988 Maldives coup d'état#Operation Cactus|reversing the military coup]] in [[Maldives]] back in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cbi.nic.in/dop/judgements/thomas.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-05-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102222525/http://cbi.nic.in/dop/judgements/thomas.pdf |archive-date=2011-11-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The judgement further cited the death of [[Thileepan]] in a hunger strike and the suicide by 12 LTTE cadres in a vessel in October 1987. While convicting the accused, four of them to death and others to various jail terms, the judgment stated that no evidence existed that any one of the conspirators ever desired the death of any Indian other than Rajiv Gandhi, though several others were killed. Judge Wadhwa further stated there was nothing on record to show that the intention to kill Rajiv Gandhi was to overawe the government. Hence it was held that it was not a terrorist act under TADA (Act).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl1611/16111030.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Out of the TADA net}}</ref><ref name=cbi>{{cite web |url=http://cbi.nic.in/judgements/thomas.pdf |title=Death Reference Case No. (@ D.NO.1151 of 1998) |publisher=Cbi.nic.in |access-date=2014-08-03 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Judge Thomas further stated that conspiracy was hatched in stages commencing from 1987 and that it spanned several years. The special investigation team of India's premier special investigation agency [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] was not able to pinpoint when the decision to kill Rajiv Gandhi was taken.<ref name=cbi />

==Trial==
The trial was conducted under the [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities Act]]. On 28 January 1998, the designated TADA court in [[Chennai]] gave death sentences to all the 26 accused.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-case-tracing-the-trial/453154-3.html |title=Rajiv Gandhi assassination case: tracing the trial |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |access-date=2014-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/nation/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-timeline.html |title=Rajiv Gandhi assassination Timeline |publisher=Dailypioneer.com |date=2014-02-20 |access-date=2014-08-03}}</ref> This created a storm in India.

Ms A. Athirai, an accused, was 17 years old when she was arrested.

Under the TADA an accused can appeal only to the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]]. Appeal to the [[Madras High Court|High Court]] is not allowed as in normal law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.derechos.org/saran/lanka/3298.html |title=Human Rights Bulletin on Srfati Lanka |publisher=Derechos.org |access-date=2014-08-03}}</ref> Confessions given by the accused to the Superintendent of Police are taken as evidence against the accused under TADA. Under TADA the accused could be convicted on the basis of evidence that would have been insufficient for conviction by an ordinary court under normal Indian law. In the Rajiv Gandhi case, confessions by the accused formed a major part of the evidence in the judgement against them which they later claimed was taken under duress.<ref>{{cite web |title=In the Supreme Court of India – Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction |url=http://cbi.nic.in/Judgements/wadwa.htm |website=cbi.nic.in |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122000734/http://cbi.nic.in/Judgements/wadwa.htm |archive-date=2007-01-22}}</ref>

On appeal to the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]], only four of the accused were sentenced to death and the others to various jail terms. S Nalini Sriharan is the lone surviving member of the five-member squad behind the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi and is serving life imprisonment. Arrested on 14 June 1991, she was sentenced to death, along with the other 25 accused. However, the court confirmed that the death sentence was given to only four of the convicts, including Nalini, on 11 May 1999. Nalini, who is the wife of an LTTE operative known as V Sriharan alias Murugan, another convict in the case who had been sentenced to death, later gave birth to a girl, Harithra Murugan in prison. Upon the intervention of Rajiv Gandhi's widow and Congress president [[Sonia Gandhi]], who petitioned for clemency for the sake of Nalini's daughter in 2000, the death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Nalini was treated as a class 'A' convict from 10 September 1999 till the privilege was withdrawn in May 2010 after a mobile phone was allegedly recovered from her cell during a surprise check. She "regrets" the killing of the former Prime Minister and claims that the real conspirators have not been booked yet.<ref>{{cite news|agency=PTI|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-08-03/india/27901060_1_rajiv-gandhi-assassination-case-nalini-sriharan-suicide-bomber |title=I regret Rajiv Gandhi's assassination: Nalini|publisher=The Times of India|date=2008-08-03 |access-date=2013-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|agency=IANS |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_my-sins-washed-away-says-nalini-sriharan_1159967 |title=My sins washed away, says Nalini Sriharan|publisher=DNA India|date=2008-04-16 |access-date=2013-08-30}}</ref> The President of India rejected the clemency pleas of Murugan and two others on death row, T Suthendraraja alias Santhan and A G Perarivalan alias Arivu in August 2011.<ref>{{cite news|agency=TNN |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-11/india/30141652_1_vellore-prison-nalini-sriharan-puzhal-prison |title=Nalini meets hubby on death row|publisher=The Times of India|date=2011-09-11 |access-date=2013-08-30}}</ref> The execution of the three convicts was scheduled for 9 September 2011.

However, the state government rejected her request.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/Rajiv+Gandhi+assassin+Nalini+Sriharan+not+to+be+freed/1/90329.html |title=Rajiv Gandhi assassin Nalini Sriharan not to be freed|publisher=India Today|date=2010-03-29 |access-date=2013-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|agency=TNN |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-16/india/31200948_1_special-prison-puzhal-m-radhakrishnan |title=Rajiv Gandhi's assassin Nalini gets back 'A' class jail facilities|publisher=The Times of India|date=2012-03-16 |access-date=2013-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/rajiv-gandhi-s-killer-nalini-breaks-down-132130 |title=Rajiv Gandhi's killer Nalini breaks down |publisher=NDTV |date=2011-09-07 |access-date=2013-08-30}}</ref> Murugan, Santhan and Perarivalan, the three convicts condemned to death, claimed that they were not ordinary criminals but political prisoners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_rajiv-gandhi-assassination-convict-nalini-shifted-to-vellore-prison_1584208 |title=Nalini Sriharan back in Vellore|publisher=DNA India|date=2011-09-07 |access-date=2013-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-06-29/chennai/28311629_1_premature-release-prison-manual-rules-nalini-sriharan |title=Nalini shifted from Vellore jail to Puzhal|publisher=The Times of India|date=2010-06-29 |access-date=2013-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=A Subramani|agency=TNN|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-01-21/india/28126770_1_premature-release-vellore-prison-nalini |title=After 19 yrs in jail for Rajiv murder, Nalini may be freed|publisher=The Times of India|date=2010-01-21 |access-date=2013-08-30}}</ref>

==Controversies==
In a report published on 30 October 2012 in [http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_ib-hid-crucial-video-on-rajiv-gandhi-murder-book_1757684 DNA], K Ragothaman, former chief investigator of the CBI, talks about his new book ''[http://www.milligazette.com/news/4494-buy-a-copy-of-conspiracy-to-kill-rajiv-gandhi-from-the-cbi-files Conspiracy to Kill Rajiv Gandhi: From the CBI Files]'' and tells the reporter that while the CBI had started a preliminary inquiry in which MK Narayanan, former West Bengal Governor and former Intelligence Bureau director,  was named a suspect in hiding evidence, the case was buried by the CBI SIT Chief, D.R. Karthikeyan.

In an interview in 2017, Justice K.T. Thomas had said that "there were serious flaws" in the CBI's investigation in case, particularly related to the seizure of Rs 40 lakh in cash from the convicts, which led him to believe that the probe exposed "an unpardonable flaw" in the "Indian criminal justice system".{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

==Jain Commission and other reports==
In the Jain report, various people and agencies are named as suspected of having been involved in the murder of Rajiv Gandhi. Among them, the cleric [[Chandraswami]] was suspected of involvement, including financing the assassination.<ref>[http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_print.asp?id=266715 outlookindia.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015094247/http://www.outlookindia.com/pti_print.asp?id=266715 |date=October 15, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19980711/19250694.html |title=Probe Chandraswami's role in Rajiv case - Jain report |publisher=Expressindia.com |date=1987-09-23 |access-date=2014-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=CBI sees godman's role in Rajiv's killing |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/Dec112004/i2.asp |website=www.deccanherald.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228043145/http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/Dec112004/i2.asp |archive-date=2004-12-28}}</ref>
One of the accused, Ranganath, said Chandraswami was the godfather who financed the killing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19990514/ige14006.html |title=Chandraswami had a hand in the plot |publisher=Expressindia.com |date=1999-05-14 |access-date=2014-08-03}}</ref>
Sikh Militants were also suspected.<ref>[http://www.india-today.com/jain/vol3/chap2.html Jain Commission Report Chapter Ii] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111503/http://www.india-today.com/jain/vol3/chap2.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.india-today.com/jain/vol3/chap8.html Jain Commission Report Chapter Viii] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815221832/http://www.india-today.com/jain/vol3/chap8.html |date=August 15, 2006 }}</ref>
The interim report of the [[Jain Commission]] created a storm when it accused [[M. Karunanidhi]] the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu of a role in the assassination, leading to Congress withdrawing its support for the [[I. K. Gujral]] government and fresh elections in 1998.  Also other strong LTTE sympathizers [[Vaiko]] with [[Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam|MDMK]] and [[Thol. Thirumavalavan]] with [[Dalit Panthers of India|VCK]] have supported Congress under Sonia Gandhi in the past. Vaiko left the UPA alliance before the [[2009 Indian general election|2009 election]], partly due to the Sri Lankan issue. In the 2001 Norway peace talks, Prabhakaran told the press that the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi was a sorrowful event.
In 2006, LTTE spokesman Anton Balasingham told the Indian television channel [[NDTV]] that the killing was a "great tragedy, a monumental historical tragedy which we deeply regret".<ref>[http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=70062 We deeply regret Rajiv's death: LTTE] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513024836/http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=70062 |date=13 May 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news
