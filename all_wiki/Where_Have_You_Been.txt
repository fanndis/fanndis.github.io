"'''Where Have You Been'''" is a song by [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] singer [[Rihanna]], from her sixth studio album, ''[[Talk That Talk (Rihanna album)|Talk That Talk]]'' (2011) serving as the fifth single. The song was written by [[Ester Dean]], [[Geoff Mack]], [[Dr. Luke|Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald]], [[Cirkut (producer)|Henry "Cirkut" Walter]], and [[Calvin Harris]], with production handled by the latter three. "Where Have You Been" was released as the third international single on May 8, 2012. The track is a [[dance-pop]] and [[techno]] [[House music|house]] song that draws influence from [[Trance music|trance]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]. It is backed by "hard, chilly synths" and contains an [[Electro (music)|electro]]-inspired breakdown sequence. The song's lyrics interpolate Geoff Mack's 1959 song "[[I've Been Everywhere]]" and speak of a woman who is searching for a partner who will sexually please her.

"Where Have You Been" was met with positive reviews from most music critics, who likened the song to ''Talk That Talk'''s lead single, "[[We Found Love]]". The track performed well on major international charts. In the United States, "Where Have You Been" reached number five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], marking Rihanna's twenty-second top ten single on the chart. It also peaked at number one in Mexico, on both the US [[Dance Club Songs]] and [[UK Dance Chart]], and at number three on the US [[Pop Songs]] chart. In addition, it attained top five positions in the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Israel, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, while peaking in the top ten of charts in twenty countries worldwide including Australia, Belgium and Norway. The song is certified Platinum or higher in eight countries.

The song's accompanying music video, directed by [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]] depicts the singer in an assortment of costumes and locations, referencing the song's lyrics. Rihanna is seen as a semi-naked water reptilian, in an [[Egypt]]ian desert, an [[Africa]]n themed hut, and channeling [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] with multiple limbs. The video received a positive response from critics, who praised Rihanna's new approach to deeper choreography. Rihanna has performed the song on both ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and the finale of the eleventh season of ''[[American Idol]]''. The song was [[2013 Grammy Awards|nominated for a 2013]] [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance]].

}} 
The video's concept shows Rihanna travelling around various locations "looking for a male partner who will please her". The video begins with a shot of flowing water which appears to be set in a dark swamp-like area. Rihanna's head is then shown hovering above the water as she begins the first verse. She is then presented as a [[reptile|reptilian]] creature as part of her back rises above the water. Rihanna then exits the water, showing a [[Scale (zoology)|scale]] ensemble, much like a reptile, which covers her breasts. As the bridge begins, a close up of Rihanna's face is shown, half covered in a shawl, identical to the single cover. Choreography then begins as the singer is shown with a group of male dancers behind her, wearing tribal costumes in what appears to be an [[Egypt]]ian desert. Rihanna dons a [[zebra]]-print outfit with oversized red trousers as she puts on a fast-paced routine against the backdrop of [[Pyramids of Egypt|pyramids]]. Empty tree branches are shown, as well as a fire and a starry sky. Scenes of a nude Rihanna are intercut, holding a [[whip]] made of hair, while simultaneously covering her breasts.

As the second verse begins, Rihanna is seen in an [[Africa]]n hut lying on the floor, surrounded by female dancers. She performs on the floor, in one moment managing to put her leg over her head, before standing up and again, performing a dance routine. The performers are seen to make the shape of an eye, with Rihanna in the centre as the pupil. In this scene she wears a black lace ensemble with a new wild curly hairstyle. This is followed with the singer lying in a large birds' nest and then goes back to the singer with her previous wild hairstyle, performing a complex dance routine with female dancers, this time with fluorescent green effects. The penultimate scene shows Rihanna in a long dress which lights up neon red, while the singer has sequins across her face. She then appears to channel Hindu god [[Shiva]] as multiple arms surround her body. In the final scene, Rihanna and her male background dancers seen previously, slowly descend back underwater into the swamp; Rihanna's head completely submerges below the water.{{cn|date=April 2020}}
