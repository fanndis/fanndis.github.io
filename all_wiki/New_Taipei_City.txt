'''New Taipei City'''{{efn native lang|tw|name=word1}} is a [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] and the most populous city in [[Taiwan]]. Located in [[Geography of Taiwan|northern Taiwan]], the city includes a substantial stretch of the island's northern coastline and surrounds the [[Taipei Basin]], making it the second largest special municipality by area, behind [[Kaohsiung]]. New Taipei City is bordered by [[Keelung]] to the northeast, [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]] to the southeast, and [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]] to the southwest. It completely surrounds [[Taipei]]. [[Banqiao District]] is its municipal seat and biggest commercial area. Until 2010, the area that roughly corresponds to the present New Taipei City was known as '''Taipei County'''.

==Name==
'''New Taipei City''' was known as '''Taipei County''' before its promotion to [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|city status]] in 2010. After the county's population overtook that of [[Taipei City]], it was decided that the county should be promoted to city status; however, it could not also be renamed as "Taipei City".

The name of the new entity ({{zh|t=新北市|l=New North City|labels=no}}) was at first rendered in English as '''Xinbei City''' via [[pinyin]] [[romanization]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=D0060113|script-title=zh:標準地名譯寫準則|date=9 November 2009|publisher=[[Ministry of Justice of the Republic of China]]|accessdate=23 December 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5zBxZGcKI?url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=D0060113|archive-date=4 June 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.tw/files/site_content/M0001/yuanze.pdf|script-title=zh:中文譯音使用原則|date=18 December 2008|publisher=[[Ministry of Education of the Republic of China]]|accessdate=23 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212064918/http://www.edu.tw/files/site_content/M0001/yuanze.pdf|archive-date=12 February 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> but both candidates for the city's first mayoral election opposed the name. Consequently, citing public opinion, the inaugural mayor, [[Eric Chu]], requested and received approval from the [[Ministry of the Interior (Republic of China)|Ministry of the Interior]] (MOI) to render the name in English as '''New Taipei City'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cna.com.tw/SearchNews/doDetail.aspx?id=201012200179|script-title=zh:新北市譯名 朱立倫依多數民意|date=20 December 2010|publisher=[[Central News Agency (Republic of China)|Central News Agency]]|accessdate=23 December 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303182528/http://www.cna.com.tw/SearchNews/doDetail.aspx?id=201012200179|archive-date=3 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|publisher=[[Ministry of Interior of the Republic of China]]|date=31 December 2010|script-title=zh:尊重新北市政府的意見，新北市譯寫為「New Taipei City」|url=http://www.moi.gov.tw/chi/chi_news/news_detail.aspx?type_code=02&sn=4919|access-date=31 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108124554/http://www.moi.gov.tw/chi/chi_news/news_detail.aspx?type_code=02&sn=4919|archive-date=8 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> This rendering became official on 31 December 2010.

==History==
===Early history===
Archaeological records show that New Taipei City had been inhabited since the [[Neolithic]] period, with artifacts dug in [[Bali District]] having shown remains as early as 7000 to 4700 BC. The region around New Taipei City area was once inhabited by [[Ketagalan people|Ketagalan]] [[Taiwanese Plains Aborigines|plains aborigines]], and evidence shows that the [[Atayal people|Atayal]] had inhabited [[Wulai District]]. The earliest recorded migration by people from [[mainland China]] dated back as early as 1620, when the local tribes were driven into the mountain areas. Over the years, many of the aborigines have assimilated into the general population.<ref name="cincinnatisistercity.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnatisistercity.org/taipei_info.htm|title=Cincinnati Sister Cities|accessdate=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705051047/http://www.cincinnatisistercity.org/taipei_info.htm|archive-date=5 July 2015}}</ref>

===Qing dynasty===
During the [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing Dynasty rule of Taiwan]], the [[Han Chinese]] people began to settle in the area now designated as New Taipei City in 1694 and the number of immigrants from mainland China had further increased. After decades of development and prosperity, [[Tamsui District|Tamsui]] had become an international commercial port by 1850. [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] consulate and stores were established in the region, which helped promote the local tea business, resulting in massive tea leaf exports to [[Europe]]. In 1875, [[Shen Baozhen]] called for the establishment of [[Taipeh Prefecture]]. [[Fujian-Taiwan-Province]] was declared in 1887 and the present-day New Taipei City area fell under the jurisdiction of Taipeh Prefecture.<ref name="ntpc.gov.tw">{{cite web|url=http://foreigner.ntpc.gov.tw/_file/2968/SG/44452/D40000002968000000_1.html|title=New Taipei City Government - History|accessdate=4 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705150010/http://foreigner.ntpc.gov.tw/_file/2968/SG/44452/D40000002968000000_1.html|archive-date=5 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="youtube.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjvFqhQ67cw|title=New Taipei City - A Metropolis Redefined|date=17 August 2012|work=YouTube|access-date=20 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310190005/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjvFqhQ67cw|archive-date=10 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Japanese rule===
In 1895, Taiwan was ceded by the [[Qing dynasty]] to the [[Empire of Japan]]. During [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], the New Taipei City area was administered under '''[[Taihoku Prefecture]]''' together with modern-day [[Taipei]], [[Keelung]] and [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]]. Gold and other mineral deposits were discovered at Keelung Mountain, triggering a mining boom in the region. In October 1896, Japanese government divided the mining area around Keelung Mountain into two districts: an eastern district, designated as [[Jinguashi|Kinkaseki]], and a western district, designated as [[Jiufen|Kyūfun]]. Both districts are now parts of [[Ruifang District]]. They also issued regulations barring local Taiwanese mining companies from mining in the area, giving the mining rights to Japanese companies instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwan.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=36884&CtNode=2190&mp=1006|title=Historical background|work=taiwan.gov.tw|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527212109/http://www.taiwan.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=36884&CtNode=2190&mp=1006|archive-date=27 May 2014}}</ref>

===Post-war===
After the [[Retrocession Dayhandover of Taiwan from Japan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in October 1945, from 25 December of the same year, the present New Taipei City area was administered as  '''Taipei County''' with [[Banqiao District|Banqiao City]] as the [[county seat]]. In July 1949, the size of Taipei County was reduced when [[Beitou]] and [[Shilin District|Shilin]] townships were put under the jurisdiction of the newly created [[Yangmingshan Administrative Bureau|Caoshan Administrative Bureau]], which would later be renamed the Yangmingshan Administrative Bureau. On 1 July 1968, the size of Taipei County was further reduced by {{convert|205.16|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} when [[Jingmei]], [[Muzha District|Muzha]], [[Nangang District, Taipei|Nangang]], and [[Neihu District|Neihu]] townships, along with [[Beitou]] and [[Shilin District|Shilin]], were merged into [[Taipei City]].

The county afterward had ten [[County-controlled city|county-controlled cities]] ([[Banqiao District|Banqiao]], [[Luzhou District, New Taipei|Luzhou]], [[Sanchong District|Sanchong]], [[Shulin District|Shulin]], [[Tucheng District|Tucheng]], [[Xizhi District|Xizhi]], [[Xindian District|Xindian]], [[Yonghe District|Yonghe]], [[Zhonghe District|Zhonghe]]); four [[Township (Taiwan)|urban townships]] ([[Tamsui District|Tamsui]], [[Ruifang District|Ruifang]], [[Sanxia District|Sanxia]], [[Yingge District|Yingge]]); and fifteen [[Township (Taiwan)|rural townships]] ([[Bali District|Bali]], [[Gongliao District|Gongliao]], [[Jinshan District, New Taipei|Jinshan]], [[Linkou District|Linkou]], [[Pinglin District|Pinglin]], [[Pingxi District|Pingxi]], [[Sanzhi District|Sanzhi]], [[Shenkeng District|Shenkeng]], [[Shiding District|Shiding]], [[Shimen District|Shimen]], [[Shuangxi District|Shuangxi]], [[Taishan District, New Taipei|Taishan]], [[Wanli District, New Taipei|Wanli]], [[Wugu District|Wugu]], [[Wulai District|Wulai]]). It was further divided into 1,017 [[Village (Taiwan)|villages]] and 21,683 neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelking.com.tw/eng/tourguide/taipei/taipeicounty.asp|title=Great Taipei Travel: Great Taipei Tours, Maps, Hotels, Attractions & Travel News(旅遊王TravelKing)|accessdate=4 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706014533/http://www.travelking.com.tw/eng/tourguide/taipei/taipeicounty.asp|archive-date=6 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In August 1992, due to the adjustment of the demarcation line between Taipei City and Taipei County around Neigou and Daking Creeks, the area of Taipei County was decreased by {{convert|0.03|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://w2.dbas.taipei.gov.tw/NEWS_WEEKLY/summeng/3E.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523011314/http://w2.dbas.taipei.gov.tw/NEWS_WEEKLY/summeng/3E.pdf |archive-date=23 May 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 25 December 2010, Taipei County was upgraded to a [[Special municipality (Republic of China)|special municipality]] as '''New Taipei City''' consisting of 29 [[District (Taiwan)|districts]] with [[Banqiao District]] as the municipal seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foreigner.ntpc.gov.tw/_file/2968/SG/44813/D40000002968000005_0.html |title=New Taipei City Government - Introduction |publisher=Foreigner.ntpc.gov.tw |accessdate=15 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024073352/http://foreigner.ntpc.gov.tw/_file/2968/SG/44813/D40000002968000005_0.html |archive-date=24 October 2013  }}</ref>
