The '''University of Hamburg''' ({{lang-de|Universität Hamburg}}, also referred to as '''UHH''') is a  [[university]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany. It was founded on 28 March 1919 by combining the previous General Lecture System (''[[:de:Allgemeines Vorlesungswesen|Allgemeines Vorlesungswesen]]''), the Colonial Institute of Hamburg (''[[:de:Hamburgisches Kolonialinstitut|Hamburgisches Kolonialinstitut]]''), and the Academic College (''[[:de:Akademisches Gymnasium (Hamburg)|Akademisches Gymnasium]]''). The main campus is located in the central district of [[Rotherbaum]], with affiliated institutes and research centres distributed around the city-state.

The university has been ranked in the top 200 universities worldwide by the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings|''Times Higher Education Ranking'']],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2017/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/name/hamburg/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats |title=World University Rankings|date=17 August 2016|newspaper=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=8 February 2017|language=en}}</ref> the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities|Shanghai Ranking]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2017.html|title=ARWU World University Rankings 2017 – Academic Ranking of World Universities 2017 – Top 500 universities – Shanghai Ranking – 2017|author=|date=|website=www.shanghairanking.com}}</ref> and the [[CWTS Leiden Ranking]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leidenranking.com/ranking/2016/list|title=CWTS Leiden Ranking 2016|last=(CWTS)|first=Centre for Science and Technology Studies|website=CWTS Leiden Ranking 2016|language=en|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref> placing it among the top 1% of global universities.<ref name="cwur.org">{{Cite web|url=http://cwur.org/about.php|title=About {{!}} CWUR {{!}} Center for World University Rankings|website=cwur.org|language=en|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref> Six [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation#Other universities|Nobel Prize Winners]] and one [[Wolf Prize]] Winner are affiliated with UHH.

==History==

===Founding===
[[File:UniHHHauptgebaeude.jpg|thumb|University Main Building (Built 1911)]]
At the beginning of the 20th century, wealthy individuals made several unsuccessful petitions to the Hamburg Senate and Parliament requesting the establishment of a university. Senator [[Werner von Melle]] worked towards the merging of existing institutions into one university, but this plan failed. Much of the establishment wanted to see Hamburg limited to its role as a trading center, and were concerned about both the costs of a university and the social ambitions of professors who would be recruited by the university.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en/uhh/profil/geschichte.html|title=History of the University|last=Admin|website=www.uni-hamburg.de|language=en|access-date=26 January 2020}}</ref>

In 1907 proponents of a university founded the Hamburg Science Foundation (''[[:de:Hamburgische Wissenschaftliche Stiftung|Hamburgische Wissenschaftliche Stiftung]]''), followed by the Hamburg Colonial Institute in 1908. The Science Foundation supported the recruitment of scholars for the chairs of the General Lecture System and funding of research cruises, while the Colonial Institute was responsible for all education and research questions concerning overseas territories. In 1911 the city's first lecture building opened, later becoming the main building of the university. Plans for the foundation of the university itself were shelved due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]].

After the war, the first freely elected senate chose von Melle as mayor. He and [[Rudolf Ross]] advocated for education reform in Hamburg, and were able to pass a law establishing both the university and an [[adult high school]]. On 28 March 1919, the University of Hamburg opened its gates, increasing the number of full professorships in Hamburg from 19 to 39. Both the Colonial Institute and the General Lecture System were absorbed into the university. The university's first Schools, or Faculties, were Law and Political Science, Medicine, Philosophy and Natural Sciences.

===Weimar Republic and the National Socialist Era===
During the [[Weimar Republic]], the university quickly grew to become important. The student population reached several thousand, and the growing popularity of the university drew scholars such as Albrecht Mendelssohn Bartholdy, [[Aby Warburg]] and [[Ernst Cassirer]] to Hamburg. Many students were suffering due to the poor economic situation that prevailed in the early republic, leading to the foundation of the Hamburg Association of Student Aid in 1922. Ernst Cassirer became the principal of the university in 1929, one of the first Jewish scholars to take that role in Germany. The number of full professors had grown to 75 by 1931.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The academic situation shifted quickly after the [[March 1933 German federal election|general election in March 1933]]. On 1 May of that year, the university held a ceremony to honor Adolf Hitler as its leader. Massive political influence by the Nazis followed, including the removal of books from the libraries and harassment against alleged enemies of the regime. About 50 scientists, including Ernst Cassirer and [[William Stern (psychologist)|William Stern]], had to leave the university.<ref name=":0" /> At least 10 Hamburg students were suspected of working with the [[White Rose]] and arrested; four died in custody or were executed. A commemorative plate depicting the foyer of the lecture hall, designed by Fritz Fleer, was produced in 1971 in their memory.

===In the Federal Republic of Germany===
[[File:Uni-hh-philo-turm.JPG|thumb|Philosopher's Tower, built in 1962]]
Once the [[Second World War]] was over, the university reopened in the winter of 1945 with 17,800 employees. Of the 2,872 students who were enrolled at the University of Hamburg in the first postwar semester of 1945/46, 601 had been admitted to the School of Philosophy, 952 to the School of Medicine, 812 to the School of Law and Political Science, and 506 to the School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. The first student association during this period was elected in 1946 under British supervision, and it became the foundation of the General Students' Committee, [[AStA]], in 1947.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

During the [[West Germany|West German era]], new departments were added to the university. In 1954 the School of Protestant Theology was added, and the School of Law separated from the School of Economic and Social Sciences. This growth was accompanied by significant construction in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Auditorium and the Philosopher's Tower were inaugurated near the Von-Melle-Park, while the Botanical Institute and Botanical Garden were relocated to Flottbeck. The university grew from 12,600 students in 1960 to 19,200 in 1970.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

A wave of protests during the [[Protests of 1968|student movements of 1968]] resulted in a reform of the university's structure. In 1969, the Faculties were dissolved in favor of more interdisciplinary departments. The involvement of students and staff in the administration was also increased, and the office of ''Rektor'' was abolished in favor of a university president.<ref name=":0" /> Parts of these reforms were rescinded in 1979 as part of the Hamburg Higher Education Act.<ref name=":0" /> The main campus in the [[Rotherbaum|Rotherbaum quarter]] was completed with additional construction in the 1970's, including the Geomatikum building and the Wiwi-Bunker (named for its bunker-like architecture). After this, growth focused on other parts of Hamburg. Two newly constructed buildings were opened adjacent to the Main Building in 1998 and 2002, revitalizing the Moorweide area of the university.

In 2005, the Hamburg University of Economy and Politics was merged into the University of Hamburg by a political act that was opposed by both institutions. Under the same act, the 17 departments of the two institutions were merged and restructured into six faculties. The implementation of the [[Bologna process]], an effort to ensure comparability of standards across European institutions, was another major point of contention during that decade. [[Tuition fee]]s were introduced at 500 euros in 2006, but later reduced to 375 euros and fully abolished in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/15/german-university-tuition-fees-abolished2 |title=German universities face funding fears as states scrap fees |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref>

==Campus==
The University of Hamburg is made up of over 180 properties scattered throughout the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gebäudeinformationen|publisher=University of Hamburg|url=http://www.uni-hamburg.de/studieren-mit-behinderung/campus-zugaenglichkeit/gebaeudeinformationen.html|date=23 October 2013|accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref> The Main Building stands on the Moorweide opposite [[Hamburg Dammtor station]], not far from the main campus at Von-Melle-Park. The State and University Library Hamburg, the [[Audimax (University of Hamburg)|Audimax (Auditorium)]], the [[Hamburg University Archive]] and several other teaching buildings are all located in that area. The second cluster of university buildings is grouped around Martin Luther King Square in the same quarter. The Geomatikum marks the western end of the campus, near [[Schlump (Hamburg U-Bahn station)|Schlump Metro Station]]. Several departments are located in other quarters: Physics is spread over branches at Jungiusstraße, [[Bergedorf]] (along with the [[Hamburg Observatory]]) and Bahrenfeld (with the world-renowned [[DESY]] and other facilities). Biology has locations in Flottbeck, while Computer Sciences moved to [[Stellingen]] in 1991. The Medical School is located in the [[University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf|University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf]].
