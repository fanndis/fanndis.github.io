'''Polskie Radio''' [[S.A. (corporation)|Spółka Akcyjna]] (PR S.A.; [[English language|English]]: Polish Radio) is [[Poland]]'s national [[Public broadcasting|public-service]] [[radio programming|radio]] broadcasting organization owned by the government of Poland.

== History ==
Polskie Radio was founded on 18 August 1925 and began making regular broadcasts from [[Warsaw]] on 18 April 1926.

[[Czesław Miłosz]], recipient of the 1980 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], worked as a literary programmer at [[Polish Radio Wilno]] in 1936.<ref>{{cite book | last = Haven | first = Cynthia L. | title = Czesław Miłosz: Conversations | publisher =[[University Press of Mississippi]] | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=r-fXgmb5EmEC&pg=PR1 | pages = xxiv| isbn = 9781578068296 }}</ref>

Before the [[Second World War]], Polish Radio operated one national channel – broadcast from 1931 from one of Europe's most powerful [[longwave]] transmitters, situated at [[Raszyn]] just outside Warsaw and destroyed in 1939 due to invasion of [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] – and nine regional stations: 
*[[Kraków]] from 15 February 1927
*[[Poznań]] from 24 April 1927
*[[Katowice]] from 4 December 1927
*[[Vilnius|Wilno]] from 15 January 1928
*[[Lwów]] from 15 January 1930
*[[Łódź]] from 2 February 1930
*[[Toruń]] from 15 January 1935
*[[Warszawa]] from 1 March 1937 – known as Warszawa II, the national channel becoming Warszawa I from this date
*[[Baranovichi|Baranowicze]] from 1 July 1938
A tenth regional station was planned for [[Lutsk|Łuck]], but the outbreak of war meant that it never opened.

After the war, Polskie Radio came under the tutelage of the state public broadcasting body ''Komitet do Spraw Radiofonii'' "Polskie Radio" (later "Polskie Radio i Telewizja" – PRT, Polish Radio and Television). This body was dissolved in  1992, Polskie Radio S.A. and [[Telewizja Polska]] S.A. becoming politically dependent corporations, each of which was admitted to full active membership of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] on 1 January 1993.
