'''''60 Minutes''''' is an American television [[news magazine]] broadcast on the [[CBS]] television network. Debuting in 1968, the program was created by [[Don Hewitt]], who chose to set it apart from other news programs by using a unique style of reporter-centered investigation. In 2002, ''60 Minutes'' was ranked number six on ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s list of the "[[TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time|50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time]]",<ref>{{cite web|title=TV Guide Names Top 50 Shows|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/04/26/entertainment/main507388.shtml|author=Bootie Cosgrove-Mather|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=April 26, 2002|access-date=March 29, 2012}}</ref> and in 2013, it was ranked number 24 on the magazine's list of the "60 Best Series of All Time".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/tv-guide-magazine-60-best-series-1074962/|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Best Series of All Time|date=December 23, 2013|website=tvguide.com}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' has called it "one of the most esteemed news magazines on American television".<ref name=nytloganapology>{{cite news|title=CBS Correspondent Apologizes for Report on Benghazi Attack|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/09/business/media/cbs-correspondent-apologizes-for-report-on-benghazi-attack.html|author=Bill Carter|author2=Michael S.

==Broadcast history==
===Early years===
[[Image:60 Minutes.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Since the show's inception in 1968, the opening of ''60 Minutes'' features a stopwatch.<ref>{{cite news|title=Timely Donation From '60 Minutes'|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/09/22/national/main18102.shtml|work=CBS News|date=September 22, 1998}}</ref> The Aristo (Heuer) design first appeared in 1978. On October 29, 2006, the background changed to red, the title text color changed to white, and the stopwatch was shifted to the upright position. This version was used from 1992 to 2006 (the Square 721 type was changed in 1998).]]

The program employed a magazine format similar to that of the Canadian program ''[[W5 (TV series)|W5]]'', which had premiered two years earlier. It pioneered many of the most important [[investigative journalism]] procedures and techniques, including re-editing interviews, hidden cameras, and "[[gotcha journalism]]" visits to the home or office of an investigative subject.<ref name="'70s">{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|page=[https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/36 36]|author=[[David Frum]]|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York City, New York|isbn=0-465-04195-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/36}}</ref> Similar programs sprang up in Australia and Canada during the 1970s, as well as on local television news.<ref name="'70s"/>

Initially, ''60 Minutes'' aired as a bi-weekly show hosted by [[Harry Reasoner]] and [[Mike Wallace]], debuting on September 24, 1968, and alternating weeks with other [[CBS News]] productions on Tuesday evenings at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. The first edition, described by Reasoner in the opening as a "kind of a magazine for television," featured the following segments:
# A look inside the headquarters suites of presidential candidates [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]] during their respective parties' national conventions that summer;
# Commentary by European writers [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], [[Peter von Zahn]], and [[Luigi Barzini, Jr.]] on the American electoral system;
# A commentary by political columnist [[Art Buchwald]];
# An interview with then-[[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Ramsey Clark]] about police brutality;
# "A Digression," a brief, scripted piece in which two silhouetted men (one of them [[Andy Rooney]]) discuss the presidential campaign;
# An abbreviated version of an [[Academy Award]]-winning short film by [[Saul Bass]], ''[[Why Man Creates]];'' and
# A meditation by Wallace and Reasoner on the relation between perception and reality. Wallace said that the show aimed to "reflect reality".

The first "magazine-cover" [[chroma key]] was a photo of two helmeted policemen (for the Clark interview segment). Wallace and Reasoner sat in chairs on opposite sides of the set, which had a cream-colored backdrop; the more famous black backdrop (which is still used {{as of|2020|lc=y}}) did not appear until the following year. The logo was in [[Helvetica]] type with the word "Minutes" spelled in all lower-case letters; the logo most associated with the show (rendered in Square 721 type with "Minutes" spelled in uppercase) did not appear until about 1974. Further, to extend the magazine motif, the producers added a "Vol. xx, No. xx" to the title display on the chroma key; modeled after the volume and issue number identifications featured in print magazines, this was used until about 1971. The trademark stopwatch, however, did not appear on the inaugural broadcast; it would not debut until several episodes later. [[Alpo (pet food)|Alpo]] dog food was the sole sponsor of the first program.<ref name="60MinutesHD">{{cite web|title=60 Minutes Goes HD With Nominees|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/60-minutes-goes-hd-with-nominees/22031|author=Steve K|work=[[AdWeek|TVNewser]]|publisher=[[Mediabistro.com]]|date=September 17, 2008|access-date=March 29, 2012}}</ref>

Don Hewitt, who had been a producer of the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' with [[Walter Cronkite]], sought out Wallace as a stylistic contrast to Reasoner.<ref name="Madsen">Madsen, p. 14</ref> According to one historian of the show, the idea of the format was to make the hosts the reporters, to always feature stories that were of national importance but focused upon individuals involved with, or in conflict with, those issues, and to limit the reports' airtime to around 13 minutes.<ref name="Madsen"/> However, the initial season was troubled by lack of network confidence, as the program did not garner ratings much higher than that of other CBS News documentaries. As a rule, during that era, news programming during [[prime time]] lost money; networks mainly scheduled [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programs in prime time in order to bolster the prestige of their news departments, and thus boost ratings for the regular evening newscasts, which were seen by far more people than documentaries and the like. ''60 Minutes'' struggled under that stigma during its first three years.

Changes to ''60 Minutes'' came fairly early in the program's history. When Reasoner left CBS to co-anchor [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[ABC World News Tonight|evening newscast]] (he would return to CBS and ''60 Minutes'' in 1978), [[Morley Safer]] joined the team in 1970, and he took over Reasoner's duties of reporting less aggressive stories. However, when Richard Nixon began targeting press access and reporting, even Safer, formerly the CBS News bureau chief in [[Saigon]] and [[London]], began to do "hard" investigative reports, and during the 1970–71 season alone, ''60 Minutes'' reported on [[cluster bomb]]s, the [[South Vietnamese Army]], [[draft dodger]]s, [[Nigeria]], the Middle East, and [[Northern Ireland]].<ref name="Madsen 15">Madsen, p. 15</ref>

===Effects from the Prime Time Access Rule===
[[File:General Schwartz on 60 Minutes.jpg|thumb|Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. [[Norton A. Schwartz]] in an interview with [[Lara Logan]], April 15, 2009.]]
By 1971, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) introduced the [[Prime Time Access Rule]], which freed local network affiliates in the top 50 markets (in practice, the entire network) to take a half-hour of prime time from the networks on Mondays through Saturdays and one full hour on Sundays. Because nearly all affiliates found production costs for the FCC's intended goal of increased public affairs programming very high and the ratings (and by association, advertising revenues) low, making it mostly unprofitable, the FCC created an exception for network-authored news and public affairs shows. After a six-month hiatus in late 1971, CBS found a prime place for ''60 Minutes'' in a portion of that displaced time, 6:00&nbsp;p.m. to 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern (5:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]) on Sundays in January 1972.<ref name="Madsen 15"/>

This proved somewhat less than satisfactory, however, because in order to accommodate [[NFL on CBS|CBS]]' telecasts of late afternoon [[National Football League]] (NFL) football games, ''60 Minutes'' went on hiatus during the fall from 1972 to 1975 (and the summer of 1972). This took place because football telecasts were protected contractually from interruptions in the wake of the infamous "[[Heidi Game|Heidi Bowl]]" incident on [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] in November 1968. Despite the irregular scheduling, the program's hard-hitting reports attracted a steadily growing audience, particularly during the waning days of the [[Vietnam War]] and the gripping events of the [[Watergate scandal]]; at that time, few if any other major network news shows did in-depth investigative reporting to the degree carried out by ''60 Minutes.'' Eventually, during the summers of 1973 through 1975, CBS did allow the program back onto the prime time schedule proper, on Fridays in 1973 and Sundays the two years thereafter, as a replacement for programs aired during the regular television season.

It was only when the FCC returned an hour to the networks on Sundays (for news or family programming), which had been taken away from them four years earlier, in a 1975 amendment to the Access Rule, that CBS finally found a viable permanent timeslot for ''60 Minutes''. When the family-oriented drama ''[[Three for the Road (TV series)|Three for the Road]]'' ended after a 12-week run in the fall, the newsmagazine took its place at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time (6:00&nbsp;p.m. Central) on December 7, 1975. It has aired at that time since for 45 years {{as of|2020|lc=y}}, making it not only the longest-running prime time program currently in production, but also the television program (excluding daily programs such as evening newscasts or [[breakfast television|morning news-talk]] shows) broadcasting for the longest length of time at a single time period each week in U.S. television history.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

This move, and the addition of then-[[The White House|White House]] correspondent [[Dan Rather]] to the reporting team, made the program into a strong ratings hit and, eventually, a general cultural phenomenon. This was no less than a stunning reversal of the historically poor ratings performances of documentary programs on network television. By 1976, ''60 Minutes'' became the top-rated program on Sunday nights in the U.S. By 1979, it had achieved the #1 spot among all television programs in the [[Nielsen ratings]], unheard of before for a news broadcast in prime time. This success translated into great profits for CBS; advertising rates increased from $17,000 per 30-second spot in 1975 to $175,000 in 1982.<ref>Madsen, p. 17</ref>

The program sometimes does not start until after 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern, due largely to CBS' live broadcast of NFL games. At the conclusion of an NFL game, ''60 Minutes'' will air in its entirety and delay all subsequent programs. However, in the two westernmost time zones, ''60 Minutes'' is always able to start at its scheduled time as live sports coverage ends earlier in the afternoon. The program's success has also led [[CBS Sports]] to schedule events (such as the final round of the [[Masters Tournament]] and the second round and regional final games of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament]]) leading into ''60 Minutes'' and the rest of the network's primetime lineup.

Starting in the 2012–2013 season, in order to accommodate a new NFL scheduling policy that the second game of a doubleheader start at 4:25&nbsp;p.m., CBS changed the scheduled start time of ''60 Minutes'' to 7:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern time for Eastern and Central Time Zone stations which are receiving a game in that window. The start time remains at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern on stations which are not broadcasting a late game in a given week.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS Responds to NFL Doubleheaders by Pushing Sunday Series Back 30 Minutes|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/good-wife-mentalist-amazing-race-premieres-schedule-nfl-369481|author=Michael O'Connell|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 11, 2012}}</ref>

===Radio broadcast and Internet distribution===
''60 Minutes'' is also simulcast on several former [[CBS Radio]] flagship stations now owned by [[Entercom]] (such as [[KYW-AM|KYW]] in Philadelphia, [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] in [[New York City]], [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] in [[Chicago]], [[WWJ (AM)|WWJ]] in [[Detroit]] and [[KCBS (AM)|KCBS]] in [[San Francisco]]) when it airs locally on their sister CBS Television Network affiliate; even in the Central and Eastern time zones, the show is aired at the top of the hour at 7:00&nbsp;p.m./6:00&nbsp;p.m. Central (barring local sports play-by-play pre-emptions and breaking news coverage) no matter how long the show is delayed on CBS Television, resulting in radio listeners often hearing the show on those stations ahead of the television broadcast. An audio version of each broadcast without advertising began to be distributed via [[podcast]] and the [[iTunes Store]], starting with the broadcast on September 23, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Making 60 Minutes Available as Free Podcast|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/cbs-making-60-minutes-available-free-podcast/30717|author=Alex Weprin|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=September 20, 2007|access-date=March 29, 2012}}</ref> Video from ''60 Minutes'' (including full episodes) is also made available for streaming several hours after the program's initial broadcast on CBSNews.com and [[CBS All Access]].

==Format==
''60 Minutes'' consists of three long-form news stories without superimposed graphics. There is a [[Television advertisement|commercial break]] between two stories. Each story is introduced from a set with a backdrop resembling pages from a magazine story on the same topic. The program undertakes its own investigations and follows up on investigations instigated by national newspapers and other sources.  Unlike its most famous competitor ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' as well as traditional local and national news programs, the ''60 Minutes'' journalists never share the screen with (or speak to) other ''60 Minutes'' journalists on camera at ''any'' time.  This creates a strong psychological sense of intimacy between the journalist and the television viewer.

===Reporting tone===
''60 Minutes'' blends the probing journalism of the seminal 1950s CBS series ''[[See It Now]]'' with [[Edward R. Murrow]] (a show for which Hewitt served as the director for its first few years) and the personality profiles of another Murrow program, ''Person to Person''. In Hewitt's own words, ''60 Minutes'' blends "higher Murrow" and "lower Murrow".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ajrarchive.org/Article.asp?id=4620|title=What Would Murrow Do?|last=Potter|first=Deborah|date=October 2008|website=American Journalism Review|publisher=Phillip Merrill College of Journalism|access-date=January 18, 2017}}</ref>

==="Point/Counterpoint" segment===
For most of the 1970s, the program included ''Point/Counterpoint'', in which a [[liberalism|liberal]] and a [[conservatism|conservative]] commentator debated a particular issue. This segment originally featured [[James J. Kilpatrick]] representing the conservative side and [[Nicholas von Hoffman]]<ref name="sentinelsource.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.sentinelsource.com/opinion/my-gifted-counterpoint-on-minutes-wrote-like-an-angel-by/article_cf66570c-f7aa-5f2a-9b2f-b636f24420cd.html|title=My gifted counterpoint on '60 Minutes' wrote like an angel, by James J.

In 1979, Alexander asked Hewitt to raise the pay of $350 a week; Hewitt declined, and the segment ended.<ref name="sentinelsource.com"/>

''Point/Counterpoint'' was also lampooned by the NBC comedy series ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which featured [[Jane Curtin]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]] as debaters, with Aykroyd announcing the topic, Curtin making an opening statement, then Aykroyd typically retorting with, "Jane, you ignorant slut" and Curtin with "Dan, you pompous ass";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/point-counterpoint-lee-marvin-and-michelle-triola/2846665|title=Point Counterpoint: Lee Marvin and Michelle Triola|date=March 17, 1979|website=nbc.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77oupdate.phtml|title=SNL Transcripts: Christopher Lee: 03/25/78: Weekend Update with Jane Curtin & Dan Aykroyd|website=snltranscripts.jt.org|access-date=February 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219090708/http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77oupdate.phtml|archive-date=February 19, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77rupdate.phtml|title=SNL Transcripts: Steve Martin: 04/22/78: Weekend Update with Jane Curtin & Dan Aykroyd|website=snltranscripts.jt.org|access-date=February 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801154123/http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77rupdate.phtml|archive-date=August 1, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/78/78aupdate.phtml|title=SNL Transcripts: The Rolling Stones: 10/07/78: Weekend Update with Jane Curtin & Bill Murray|website=snltranscripts.jt.org|access-date=February 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731112439/http://snltranscripts.jt.org/78/78aupdate.phtml|archive-date=July 31, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/78/78eupdate.phtml|title=SNL Transcripts: Buck Henry: 11/11/78: Weekend Update with Jane Curtin & Bill Murray|website=snltranscripts.jt.org|access-date=February 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804211247/http://snltranscripts.jt.org/78/78eupdate.phtml|archive-date=August 4, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/78/78iupdate.phtml|title=SNL Transcripts: Elliot Gould: 12/16/78: Weekend Update with Jane Curtin & Bill Murray|website=snltranscripts.jt.org|access-date=February 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110231618/http://snltranscripts.jt.org/78/78iupdate.phtml|archive-date=November 10, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/78/78oupdate.phtml|title=SNL Transcripts: Margot Kidder: 03/17/79: Weekend Update with Jane Curtin & Bill Murray|website=snltranscripts.jt.org|access-date=February 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012121546/http://snltranscripts.jt.org/78/78oupdate.phtml|archive-date=October 12, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/pictures/50-greatest-saturday-night-live-sketches-of-all-time-20140203/point-counterpoint-0207143|title=50 Greatest 'SNL' Sketches of All Time|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> in the film ''[[Airplane!]]'' (1980), in which the ''faux'' Kilpatrick argues in favor of the plane crashing stating "they bought their tickets, they knew what they were getting into"; and in an earlier [[sketch comedy]] film, ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]'', where the segment was called "Count/Pointercount".

A similar concept was revived briefly in March 2003, this time featuring [[Bob Dole]] and [[Bill Clinton]], former opponents in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 presidential election]]. The pair agreed to do ten segments, called "Clinton/Dole" and "Dole/Clinton" in alternating weeks, but did not continue into the 2003–2004 fall television season. Reports indicated that the segments were considered too gentlemanly, in the style of the earlier "Point/Counterpoint", and lacked the feistiness of ''[[Crossfire (U.S. TV program)|Crossfire]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title='60 Minutes' may veto Clinton-Dole face-offs|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/mediamix/2003-05-06-media-mix_x.htm|author=Peter Johnson|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=May 6, 2003}}</ref>

===Andy Rooney segment===
From 1978 to 2011, the program usually ended with a (usually light-hearted and humorous) commentary by [[Andy Rooney]] expounding on topics of wildly varying import, ranging from international politics, to economics, and to personal philosophy on everyday life. One recurring topic was measuring the amount of [[coffee]] in coffee cans.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Pound of Coffee?|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/07/60minutes/rooney/main543240.shtml|author=[[Andy Rooney]]|work=CBS News|date=July 6, 2003}}</ref>

Rooney's pieces, particularly one in which he referred to actor [[Mel Gibson]] as a "wacko", on occasion led to complaints from viewers.  In 1990, Rooney was suspended without pay for three months by then-CBS News President David Burke, because of the negative publicity around his saying that "too much [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]], too much food, drugs, homosexual unions, [[tobacco|cigarettes]] [are] all known to lead to premature death."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57319150/andy-rooney-dead-at-92/ | publisher=CBS News | title=Andy Rooney Dead at 92 | date=November 5, 2011}}{{dead link|date=November 2020}}</ref> He wrote an explanatory letter to a [[gay]] organization after being ordered not to do so. After only four weeks without Rooney, ''60 Minutes'' lost 20% of its audience. CBS management then decided that it was in the best interest of the network to have Rooney return immediately.<ref>{{cite news | last = Zoglin | first = Richard | author-link = Richard Zoglin | author2 = Leslie Whitaker| title = The Return of a Curmudgeon | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 12 March 1990 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,969591,00.html | access-date = October 29, 2008}}{{dead link|date=November 2020}}</ref>

Rooney published several books documenting his contributions to the program, including ''Years Of Minutes'' and ''A Few Minutes With Andy Rooney''. Rooney retired from ''60 Minutes'', delivering his final commentary on October 2, 2011, it was his 1,097th commentary over his 34-year career on the program. He died one month later on November 4, 2011. On November 13, 2011, ''60 Minutes'' featured an hour-long tribute to Rooney and his career, and included a rebroadcast of his final commentary segment.

===Opening sequence===
The opening sequence features a ''60 Minutes'' "magazine cover" with the show's trademark, an [[TAG Heuer|Aristo]] [[stopwatch]], intercut with preview clips of the episode's stories. The sequence ends with each of the current correspondents and hosts introducing themselves. The last host who appears (currently [[Scott Pelley]]) then says, "Those stories tonight on ''60 Minutes''". When Rooney was a prominent fixture, the final line was "Those stories and Andy Rooney, tonight on ''60 Minutes''". Before that, and whenever Rooney did not appear, the final line was "Those stories and more, tonight on ''60 Minutes''".

The stopwatch counts off each of the broadcast's 60 minutes, starting from zero at the beginning of each show. It is seen during the opening title sequence, before each commercial break, and at the tail-end of the closing credits, and each time it appears it displays (within reasonable accuracy) the elapsed time of the episode to that point.

On October 29, 2006, the opening sequence changed from a black background, which had been used for over a decade, to white. Also, the gray background for the Aristo stopwatch in the "cover" changed to red, the color for the title text changed to white, and the stopwatch itself changed from the diagonal position it had been oriented in for 31 years to an upright position.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Based on [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], ''60 Minutes'' is the most successful program in U.S. television history since it was moved into its present timeslot in 1975. For five of its seasons it has been that year's top program, a feat matched by the [[situation comedy|sitcoms]] ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', and surpassed only by the reality competition series ''[[American Idol]]'', which had been the #1 show for eight consecutive seasons from the 2003–2004 television season up to the 2010–2011 season. ''60 Minutes'' was a top ten show for 23 seasons in a row (1977–2000), an unsurpassed record, and has made the Top 20 for every season since the 1976–1977 season, except the 2005–2006 season, when it finished at #21.<ref name=CBS>{{cite news|title=60 Minutes: Milestones|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/08/20/60minutes/main59202.shtml|work=CBS|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=August 20, 1999|access-date=May 22, 2007|postscript=News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602120101/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/08/20/60minutes/main59202.shtml|archive-date=June 2, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Longest-running primetime show===
''60 Minutes'' currently holds the record for the longest continuously running program of any genre scheduled during American network prime time, it has aired at 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on Sundays since December 7, 1975 (although since 2012, it is officially scheduled for 7:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on Sundays where a CBS affiliate has a late NFL game).

The longer-running ''[[Meet the Press]]'' has also aired in prime time. Debuting in 1947, it has been a daytime program since 1965. The [[Walt Disney anthology television series]], which premiered in 1954, and the ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'', which has aired since 1951, have aired longer than ''60 Minutes'', but none of them has aired in prime time continually, as ''60 Minutes'' has done.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Controversies==
The show has been praised for landmark journalism and received many awards. However, it has also become embroiled in some controversy, including (in order of appearance):

===Unintended acceleration===
On November 23, 1986, ''60 Minutes'' aired a segment [[greenlight|greenlit]] by Hewitt, concerning the [[Audi 5000]] automobile, a popular [[Germany|German]] luxury car. The story covered a supposed problem of "unintended acceleration" when the brake pedal was pushed, with emotional interviews with six people who sued Audi (unsuccessfully) after they crashed their cars, including one woman whose six-year-old son had been killed. In the ''60 Minutes'' segment footage was shown of an Audi 5000 with the accelerator "moving down on its own", accelerating the car. It later emerged that an expert witness employed by one of the plaintiffs modified the accelerator with a concealed device, causing the "unintended acceleration".<ref>{{cite news|title=Audi Investigated for Unintended Acceleration|url=http://www.automobile.com/audi-investigated-for-unintended-acceleration.html|work=Automobile.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121217135715/http://www.automobile.com/audi-investigated-for-unintended-acceleration.html|archive-date=December 17, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Independent investigators concluded that this "unintended acceleration" was most likely due to driver error, where the driver let their foot slip off the brake and onto the accelerator. Tests by [[Audi]] and independent journalists showed that even with the [[Wide open throttle|throttle wide open]], the car would simply stall if the brakes were actually being used.<ref>{{cite news|title=Audi's Runaway Trouble With the 5000|author=Brock Yates|work=[[Washington Post Magazine]]|date=December 21, 1986}}</ref>

The incident devastated Audi sales in the United States, which did not rebound for 15 years. The initial incidents which prompted the report were found by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] and [[Transport Canada]] to have been attributable to operator error, where car owners had depressed the accelerator pedal instead of the brake pedal. CBS issued a partial retraction, without acknowledging the test results of involved government agencies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manufacturing the Audi Scare|url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cjm_18.htm|author=Peter Huber|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]]|date=December 18, 1989}}</ref> Years later, ''[[Dateline NBC]]'', a rival to ''60 Minutes'', was found guilty of similar tactics regarding the fuel tank integrity of [[Dateline NBC#General Motors vs. NBC|General Motors pickup trucks]].<ref>{{cite web|title='Dateline' Disaster: NBC and General Motors feud over a staged car accident|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305709,00.html|author=Bruce Fretts|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=July 29, 2013}}</ref>

===Alar===
In February 1989, ''60 Minutes'' aired a report by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] claiming that the use of [[daminozide]] (Alar) on [[apple]]s presented an unacceptably high health risk to consumers. Apple sales dropped and CBS was sued unsuccessfully by apple growers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Judge Dismisses Apple Growers' Suit Against CBS|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4D61F31F937A2575AC0A965958260|work=The New York Times|date=September 14, 1993|access-date=July 21, 2007|quote=A Federal judge today dismissed a lawsuit that apple growers in Washington State filed against CBS after "60 Minutes" broadcast a report linking the chemical Alar to cancer. The report, broadcast Feb. 26, 1989, said the use of Alar increased the risk of cancer in humans, particularly children, and cited a study by the Natural Resources Defense Council.}}</ref> Alar was subsequently banned for use on food crops in the U.S. by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).

===Werner Erhard===
On March 3, 1991, ''60 Minutes'' broadcast "[[Werner Erhard]]," which dealt with controversies involving Erhard's personal and business life. A year after the ''60 Minutes'' piece aired, Erhard filed a lawsuit against CBS, claiming that the broadcast contained several "false, misleading and defamatory" statements about him. One month after filing the lawsuit, Erhard filed for dismissal.<ref name="docket">''Werner Erhard vs. Columbia Broadcasting System'', (Filed: March 3, 1992) Case Number: 1992-L-002687.

===Brown & Williamson===
In 1995, former [[Brown & Williamson]] Vice President for Research and Development [[Jeffrey Wigand]] provided information to ''60 Minutes'' producer [[Lowell Bergman]] that B&W had systematically hidden the health risks of their cigarettes (see [http://jeffreywigand.com/pascagoula.php transcription]). Furthermore, it was alleged that B&W had introduced foreign agents (such as [[Fiberglass#Health problems|fiberglass]] and [[Ammonia#As a stimulant|ammonia]]) with the intent of enhancing the effect of [[nicotine]]. Bergman began to produce a piece based upon the information, but ran into opposition from Don Hewitt who, along with CBS lawyers, feared a billion dollar lawsuit from Brown and Williamson for [[tortious interference]] for encouraging Wigand to violate his [[non-disclosure agreement]]. A number of people at CBS would benefit from a sale of CBS to [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]], including the head of CBS lawyers and CBS News. Also, because of the interview, the son of CBS President [[Laurence Tisch]] (who also controlled [[Lorillard Tobacco Company|Lorillard Tobacco]]) was among the people from the [[Big Tobacco|big tobacco companies]] at risk of being caught having committed perjury. Due to Hewitt's hesitation, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' instead broke Wigand's story. The ''60 Minutes'' piece was eventually aired with substantially altered content and minus some of the most damning evidence against B&W. The [[Investigative journalism|exposé]] of the incident was published in an article in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' by [[Marie Brenner]], entitled "The Man Who Knew Too Much".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Man Who Knew Too Much|url=http://www.mariebrenner.com/articles/insider/man1.html|author=[[Marie Brenner]]|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=MarieBrenner.com|date=May 1996|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805231342/http://www.mariebrenner.com/articles/insider/man1.html|archive-date=August 5, 2004|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

''The New York Times'' wrote that "the traditions of Edward R. Murrow and "60 Minutes" itself were diluted in the process,"<ref>{{cite news|title=Self-Censorship at CBS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/12/opinion/self-censorship-at-cbs.html|work=The New York Times|date=November 12, 1995}}</ref> though the newspaper revised the quote slightly, suggesting that ''60 Minutes'' and CBS had "betrayed the legacy of Edward R. Murrow". The incident was turned into a seven-times [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated feature film entitled ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'', directed by [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]] and starring [[Russell Crowe]] as Wigand, [[Al Pacino]] as Bergman, and [[Christopher Plummer]] as Mike Wallace. Wallace denounced the portrayal of him as inaccurate to his stance on the issue.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/WPcap/1999-10/15/046r-101599-idx.html | title=The Explosive Film That Ticked Off '60 Minutes' | author=Tom Shales | date=October 15, 1999 | newspaper=Washington Post | access-date=June 20, 2016}}</ref>

===U.S. Customs Service===
In 1997, ''60 Minutes'' alleged that agents of the [[U.S. Customs Service]] ignored drug trafficking across the [[Mexico–United States border]] at [[San Diego]].<ref>{{cite news|title=I'd Rather Be Blogging: CBS stonewalls as 'guys in pajamas' uncover a fraud.|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/diary/?id=110005611|author=[[John Fund]]|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=September 13, 2004}}</ref> The only evidence was a memorandum apparently written by Rudy Camacho, who was the head of the San Diego branch office. Based on this memo, CBS alleged that Camacho had allowed trucks belonging to a particular firm to cross the border unimpeded. Mike Horner, a former Customs Service employee, had passed the memos on to ''60 Minutes'', and even provided a copy with an official stamp. Camacho was not consulted about the piece, and his career was devastated in the immediate term as his own department placed suspicion on him. In the end, it turned out that Horner had forged the documents as an act of revenge for his treatment within the Customs Service. Camacho sued CBS and settled for an undisclosed amount of money in damages. Hewitt was forced to issue an on-air retraction.<ref>{{cite news|title=Another 60 Minutes' Apology on a Drug Smuggling Story|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/40513764.html?did=40513764&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&dids=40513764:40513764:&date=Apr+13,+1999&author=Lisa+de+Moraes&desc=Another+'60+Minutes'+Apology+on+a+Drug+Smuggling+Story|author=Lisa de Moraes|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 13, 1999}}</ref>

===Kennewick Man===
A legal battle between archaeologists and the [[Umatilla people|Umatilla]] tribe over the remains of a skeleton, nicknamed [[Kennewick Man]], was reported by ''60 Minutes'' on October 25, 1998, to which the Umatilla tribe reacted negatively. The tribe considered the segment heavily biased in favor of the scientists, cutting out important arguments, such as explanations of the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Kennewick Man issue damages relationships|url=http://www.umatilla.nsn.us/kman3.html|author=Antone Minthorn|work=Board of Trustees Chairman [[Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation]]|date=November 5, 1998|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616122302/http://www.umatilla.nsn.us/kman3.html|archive-date=June 16, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The report focused heavily on the racial politics of the controversy and also added inflammatory arguments, such as questioning the legitimacy of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] sovereignty<ref>{{cite web|title=Bones of Contention|url=http://www.common-place.org/vol-01/no-02/kennewick/kennewick-2.shtml|author=Ann Fabien|work=Common-Place.org|access-date=May 22, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031812/http://www.common-place.org/vol-01/no-02/kennewick/kennewick-2.shtml|archive-date=September 28, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> – much of the racial focus of the segment was later reported to have been either unfounded and/or misinterpreted.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Who Were The First Americans?|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1169905,00.html|author=[[Michael D.

===Timothy McVeigh===
On March 12, 2000, ''60 Minutes'' aired an interview with [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma City bomber]] [[Timothy McVeigh]]. At the time, McVeigh had already been convicted and sentenced to death for the bombing of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in April 1995, and the subsequent deaths of 168 people. On the program, McVeigh was given the opportunity to vent against the government.<ref>{{cite news|title=McVeigh Vents On '60 Minutes'|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/03/13/national/main171231.shtml|work=CBS News|date=March 13, 2000}}</ref> Following the program, a federal policy called the Special Confinement Unit Media Policy was enacted prohibiting face-to-face interviews with [[death row]] inmates.<ref>{{cite web|title=Journalism, Edward R.

===Viacom/CBS cross-promotion===
In recent years, the program has been accused of promoting books, films, and interviews with celebrities who are published or promoted by sister businesses of media conglomerate Viacom (which owned CBS from 2000 to 2005 and since 2019; both companies' shares since 2000 were majority-owned by [[National Amusements]] even during their fourteen-year separation) and publisher [[Simon & Schuster]] (which remained a part of CBS Corporation after the 2005 CBS/Viacom split and continued on after its re-merger with Viacom), without disclosing the journalistic conflict-of-interest to viewers.<ref>{{cite news|title=All in the Family: Who says 60 Minutes doesn't pay for interviews?|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/preston_regan200404020931.asp|author=Bryan Preston|author2=Chris Regan|work=[[National Review]]|date=April 2, 2004}}</ref>

===Killian documents controversy===
{{main|Killian documents controversy}}
The Killian documents controversy involved six documents critical of President [[George W. Bush]]'s service in the [[Texas Air National Guard]] from 1972 to 1973. Four of these documents were presented as authentic in a ''60 Minutes Wednesday'' broadcast aired on September 8, 2004, less than two months before the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]], but it was later found that CBS had failed to authenticate the documents. Subsequently, several typewriter and typography experts concluded the documents are forgeries, as have some media sources. No forensic document examiners or typography experts authenticated the documents, which may not be possible without original documents. The provider of the documents, Lt. Col. Bill Burkett, claimed to have burned the originals after faxing copies to CBS.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The whole incident was turned into a feature-length film entitled ''[[Truth (2015 film)|Truth]]''.

==="The Internet Is Infected" episode and the false hacker photo===
On March 29, 2009, a segment titled "The Internet Is Infected" aired on ''60 Minutes'', which featured an interview with Don Jackson, a data protection professional for [[Dell SecureWorks|SecureWorks]]. Jackson himself declared in the program that "a part of [his] job is to know the enemy". However, during the interview, Jackson showed a photo of Finnish upper-level comprehensive school pupils and misidentified them as Russian hackers.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS's 60 Minutes airs photo of Finnish children as "Russian hackers" |url=http://finland.fi/stt/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=21336&group=General |work=NewsRoom Finland |publisher=Virtual Finland, [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)|Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland]] |date=April 1, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214223232/http://finland.fi/stt/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=21336&group=General |archive-date=February 14, 2015 }}</ref> In the photo, one of the children wears a jacket with the Coat of Arms of Finland on it.

===Benghazi report===
Subsequent to the [[2012 Benghazi attack]], ''60 Minutes'' aired a report by correspondent [[Lara Logan]] on October 27, 2013, in which British military contractor Dylan Davies, identified by CBS under the pseudonym "Morgan Jones," described racing to the Benghazi compound several hours after the main assault was over, scaling a 12-foot wall and knocking out a lone fighter with the butt of a rifle. He also claimed to have visited a Benghazi hospital earlier that night where he saw Ambassador Christopher Stevens' body.

In the days following the report, Davies' personal actions were challenged.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/60-minutes-broadcast-helps-propel-new-round-of-back-and-forth-on-benghazi/2013/10/31/fbfcad66-4258-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html|title='60 Minutes' broadcast helps propel new round of back-and-forth on Benghazi|work=Washington Post|date=October 31, 2013|first=Karen|last=DeYoung}}</ref> The FBI, which had interviewed Davies several times and considered him a credible source,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/14/why-dylan-davies-disappeared.html|title=Why Dylan Davies Disappeared|work=The Daily Beast|date=November 14, 2013|first=Eli|last=Lake}}</ref> said the account Davies had given them was different than what he told ''60 Minutes''. Davies stood by his story,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/business/media/cbs-news-defends-its-60-minutes-benghazi-report.html|title=CBS News Defends Its '60 Minutes' Benghazi Report|first=Bill|last=Carter|date=November 5, 2013|work=The New York Times}}</ref> but the inconsistency ultimately prompted ''60 Minutes'' to conclude it was a mistake to include Davies in their report and a correction was issued.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/business/media/60-minutes-airs-apology-on-benghazi.html|title='60 Minutes' Airs Apology on Benghazi|first1=Brian|last1=Stelter|first2=Bill|last2=Carter|date=November 10, 2013|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

Following the correction, a journalistic review was conducted by Al Ortiz, CBS News' executive director of standards and practices. He determined that red flags about Davies' account were missed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/26/lara-logan-60-minutes-leave_n_4344883.html|title=CBS News' Lara Logan Taking Leave Of Absence Over Discredited '60 Minutes' Benghazi Report|work=The Huffington Post|date=November 26, 2013|first=Michael|last=Calderone}}</ref> Davies had said to the program and written in his book that he told an alternative version of his actions to his employer, who he said had demanded that he stay inside his Benghazi villa as the attack unfolded. That alternative version was shared with US authorities and 60 Minutes was unable to prove the story Davies had told them was true.<ref name=CBSNews>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-asks-lara-logan-to-take-leave-after-flawed-benghazi-report/|title=CBS asks Lara Logan to take Leave after Flawed Benghazi Report|work=CBS News|date=November 26, 2013}}</ref>

Davies' book, ''The Embassy House'', was published two days after the ''60 Minutes'' report, by Threshold Editions, part of the Simon and Schuster unit of CBS. It was pulled from shelves once ''60 Minutes'' issued its correction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/11/08/simon-amp-schuster-pulls-discredited-benghazi-b/196812|title=Simon & Schuster Pulls Discredited Benghazi Book|work=Media Matters|date=November 8, 2013|first=Eric|last=Hananoki}}</ref>

===Tesla automaker report===
On March 30, 2014, ''60 Minutes'' presented a story on the [[Tesla Model S]] luxury electric [[automobile]], with Scott Pelley conducting an interview with CEO [[Elon Musk]] concerning the car brand as well as his company [[SpaceX]]. Within a day, the automotive [[weblog|blog]] site [[Jalopnik]] reported that the sounds accompanying footage of the car shown during the story were actually sounds from a traditional gasoline engine dubbed over the footage, when in reality the electric car makes no such sounds.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS Says It Made 'Audio Editing Error' With Tesla On 60 Minutes|url=http://jalopnik.com/cbs-says-it-made-audio-editing-error-with-tesla-on-60-1555657624|author=Zac Estrada|work=Jalopnik.com|date=March 31, 2014}}</ref> CBS released a statement explaining that the sound was the result of an audio editing error, and subsequently removed the sound from the online version of the piece. However, several news outlets, as well as Jalopnik itself, expressed doubt over the authenticity of this explanation, noting the similar scandal involving [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla Motors]] and the ''New York Times'' in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS' '60 Minutes' admits to faking Tesla car noise|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2014/04/06/tesla-motor-sound-cbs-apology/7320361/|author=Chris Woodyard|work=USA Today |date=April 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='60 Minutes' Admits 'Audio Error' In Tesla Story|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/01/60-minutes-error-sound-car-cbs-engine-audio_n_5070297.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=The Huffington Post (AOL)|date=April 1, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407104851/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/01/60-minutes-error-sound-car-cbs-engine-audio_n_5070297.html|archive-date=April 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Spin-offs==
The main ''60 Minutes'' show has created a number of spin-offs over the years.

===''30 Minutes''===
{{Main|30 Minutes (TV program)}}
''30 Minutes'' was a newsmagazine aimed at children that was patterned after ''60 Minutes'', airing as the final program in CBS's Saturday morning lineup from 1978 to 1982. It was hosted by [[Christopher Glenn]] (who also served as the voice-over for the interstitial program ''[[In the News]]'' and was an anchor on the CBS Radio Network), along with Betsy Aaron (1978–1980) and Betty Ann Bowser (1980–1982).

===''60 Minutes More''===
''60 Minutes More'' was a spin-off that ran for one season from 1996 to 1997. The episodes featured popular stories from the past that were expanded with updates on the original story. Each episode featured three of these segments.<ref name="more">{{cite news|title=60 Minutes More|url=http://www.film.com/tv/60-minutes-more/21327868|publisher=Film.com|access-date=February 15, 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===''60 Minutes II''===
{{Main|60 Minutes II}}
In 1999, a second edition of ''60 Minutes'' was started in the United States, titled ''60 Minutes II''. This edition was later renamed ''60 Minutes'' for the fall of 2004 in an effort to sell it as a high-quality program, since some had sarcastically referred to it as ''60 Minutes, Jr.'' CBS News president [[Andrew Heyward]] said, "the [[Roman numeral]] II created some confusion on the part of the viewers and suggested a watered-down version".<ref>{{cite news|title='60 Minutes' times 2|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117905294.html?categoryid=14&cs=1|author=Pamela McClintoc|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 19, 2004|access-date=May 22, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103014825/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117905294.html?categoryid=14&cs=1|archive-date=November 3, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, a widely known controversy which came to be known as "[[Killian documents controversy|Rathergate]]", regarding a report that aired on September 8, 2004, caused another name change. The program was retitled ''60 Minutes Wednesday'' both to differentiate itself and to avoid tarnishing the Sunday edition, as the editions were editorially independent from one another. It reverted to its original Roman numeral title on July 8, 2005, when the program moved to Fridays in an 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time slot to finish its run. The show's aired its final broadcast on September 2, 2005.

===''60 Minutes on CNBC''===
In 2011, [[CNBC]] began airing a ''60 Minutes'' spin-off of its own, called ''60 Minutes on CNBC''. Hosted by Lesley Stahl and Steve Kroft, it airs updated business-related reports seen on the original broadcasts and offers footage that was not included when the segments first aired.

===''60 Minutes Sports''===
{{Main|60 Minutes Sports}}
In 2013, CBS's sister [[premium television]] network [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] premiered ''60 Minutes Sports'', a monthly spin-off focused on sports-related stories and classic interviews from the show's archives. Personalities from [[CBS Sports]] also contributed to the program. The spin-off was considered to be a competitor to [[HBO]]'s ''[[Real Sports]]'', and was cancelled in January 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/tv/story/2012/09/13/60-minutes-plans-sports-version-for-showtime/57776812/1|title=60 Minutes plans sports version for Showtime|author=Gary Levin|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 13, 2012|access-date=September 20, 2012}}</ref><ref name="lat-showtimecbs">{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/13/entertainment/la-et-ct-60-showtime-20120913|title=CBS and Showtime team up on '60 Minutes' sports magazine|last=Flint|first=Joe|date=2012-09-13|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/60-minutes-sports-canceled/316402|title=60 Minutes Sports Canceled|website=TVNewser|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-11}}</ref>

==International versions==
===Australia===
{{Main|60 Minutes (Australian TV program)}}
The Australian version of ''60 Minutes'' premiered on February 11, 1979. It still airs each Sunday night at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. on the [[Nine Network]] and affiliates. Although Nine Network has the rights to the format, {{as of|2007|lc=y}}, it does not have rights to stories from the U.S. program, which is owned by competitor [[10 News First|10 News Australia]] after [[Network Ten]]'s acquisition by CBS in 2017. Nevertheless, stories from the flagship ''60 Minutes'' program in the U.S. often air on the Australian program by subleasing them from Ten. In 1981, ''60 Minutes'' won a [[Logie Award]] for their investigation of lethal abuses at the Chelmsford psychiatric hospital in [[Sydney]].<ref name="1978-1981">{{cite web|url=http://www.australiantelevision.net/awards/logie1978_81.html|title=1978–1981 Logie Awards|publisher=Australiantelevision.net|access-date=21 June 2020}}</ref><ref name="winners">{{cite web|url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/the-logie-awards/winners/article/-/5400980/1981/ |title=1981 – The Logie Awards |publisher=[[Yahoo!7]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6P2fH50YK?url=https://au.tv.yahoo.com/the-logie-awards/winners/article/-/5400980/1981/ |archive-date=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Germany===
In the mid-1980s, an edited version (approx. 30 minutes in length) of the U.S. broadcast edition of ''60 Minutes'', entitled "60 Minutes: CBS im Dritten" ("60 Minutes: CBS on Channel 3") was shown for a time on West German television. This version retained the English-language soundtrack of the original, but also featured German subtitles.

===New Zealand===
{{Main|60 Minutes (New Zealand TV program)}}
The New Zealand version of ''60 Minutes'' has aired on national television since 1989, when it was originally launched on [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]]. In 1992, the rights were acquired by [[TVNZ]], who began broadcasting it in 1993. The network aired the program for nine years before dropping it in 2002 for its own program, entitled ''Sunday'', which is currently the highest-rated current affairs show broadcast on New Zealand television, followed by ''[[20/20 (New Zealand television series)|20/20]]''. ''60 Minutes'' was broadcast by rival network TV3, before switching to the Sky Television owned Prime channel in 2013, when the contract changed hands.

===Portugal===
The original programs are shown in Portugal on [[SIC Notícias]] with introductory and closing remarks by journalist [[Mário Crespo]].

===Chile===
The news program of [[Televisión Nacional de Chile|National Broadcasting of Chile (TVN)]], the public television network in that country, was named ''60 Minutos'' ("60 Minutes") from 1975 to 1988, but the program had no association with the US version and no investigative reporting.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
