In August 2016, prolonged rainfall from an unpredictable storm resulted in catastrophic [[flooding]] in the state of [[Louisiana]]; thousands of houses and businesses were submerged. Louisiana's governor, [[John Bel Edwards]], called the disaster a "historic, unprecedented flooding event" and declared a [[state of emergency]]. Many rivers and waterways, particularly the [[Amite River|Amite]] and [[Comite River|Comite]] rivers, reached record levels, and rainfall exceeded {{convert|20|in|mm}} in multiple parishes.

Because numerous homeowners who were affected were without [[flood insurance]], the federal government is providing disaster aid through the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA).<ref name=VoxAug2016>{{cite news |url=https://www.vox.com/2016/8/18/12522036/louisiana-flood-climate-change-emergency-management |title=The Louisiana floods are devastating, and climate change will bring more like them.

Early on August 11, a [[mesoscale convective system]] flared up in southern [[Louisiana]] around a weak area of [[low pressure]] that was situated next to an [[outflow boundary]]. It remained nearly stationary, and as a result, torrential downpours occurred in the areas surrounding [[Baton Rouge]] and [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]]. Rainfall rates of up to {{convert|2-3|in|cm}} an hour were reported in the most deluged areas where totals exceeded nearly {{convert|2|ft|cm}} in some areas as a result of the system remaining stationary.<ref>{{cite web|title=WPC Surface Analysis North America|url=http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/archives/web_pages/sfc/sfc_archive_maps.php?arcdate=08/11/2016&selmap=2016081106&maptype=satsfcnps|website=National Weather Service|accessdate=August 15, 2016}}</ref> Accumulations peaked at {{convert|31.39|in|mm}} in [[Watson, Louisiana|Watson]], just northeast of [[Baton Rouge]].<ref name="TWCAug15">{{cite web|author=Pam Wright|publisher=The Weather Channel|date=August 15, 2016|accessdate=August 15, 2016|title=Louisiana Flood By the Numbers: Tens of Thousands Impacted|url=https://weather.com/news/news/louisiana-floods-by-the-numbers}}</ref>

''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted that the "no-name storm" dumped three times as much rain on Louisiana as [[Hurricane Katrina]]. It dropped the equivalent of 7.1 trillion gallons of water or enough to fill [[Lake Pontchartrain]] about four times. Hurricane Katrina, by comparison, dumped about 2.3 trillion gallons of rainwater in the state (though more in other states). The flooding rains also dumped more water than had [[Hurricane Isaac (2012)|Hurricane Isaac]]. According to the [[National Weather Service]] Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, the amount of rainfall in the hardest-hit locations had a less than 0.1 percent chance of happening or was a (less than) 1-in-1,000-year event.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2016/08/19/no-name-storm-dumped-three-times-as-much-rain-in-louisiana-as-hurricane-katrina/ |title=No-name storm dumped three times as much rain in Louisiana as Hurricane Katrina |work=Washington Post |author=Jason Samenow |date=August 19, 2016 |accessdate=August 19, 2016}}</ref>

Because the rain was not associated with a named storm, there was less warning to the public for emergency preparations.<ref name=VoxAug2016 />

A follow-on [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309620219_Synoptic_and_quantitative_attributions_of_the_extreme_precipitation_leading_to_the_August_2016_Louisiana_flood peer-reviewed paper] <ref name="wang">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1002/2016GL071460|title = Synoptic and quantitative attributions of the extreme precipitation leading to the August 2016 Louisiana flood| journal=Geophysical Research Letters| volume=43| issue=22| pages=11,805–11,814|year = 2016|last1 = Wang|first1 = S.-Y. Simon| last2=Zhao| first2=Lin| last3=Gillies| first3=Robert R.| doi-access=free}}</ref> indicates that the catastrophic flood in Louisiana was a result of intense precipitation produced by a slow-moving, tropical, low-pressure system interacting with an eastward-traveling baroclinic trough to the north. While tropical-[[middle latitudes|midlatitude]] interactions of this nature are rare, they are not unprecedented.

Analyses point towards the tendency for more and perhaps stronger upper-level troughs propagating out of the western U.S. in summer; these have an increasing potential to cross paths with low-pressure systems that form around the [[Gulf Coast]]. Combined with the projected increase in precipitable water, resulting precipitation magnitude would increase. Large-ensemble modeling indicates that the prospect of future tropical-midlatitude interactions is a scenario that Louisiana will face in the future. Regional simulations suggest that the climate warming since 1985 may have increased the event precipitation (August 11–14, 2016) on the order of 20%.<ref name="wang"/>

Rainfall like this and the emergency help needed after the flooding subsides are straining the federal system for aid to states. Some analysts wonder if this is the new normal for storms and floods.<ref name=VoxAug2016 />

During the peak of the floods, around 265,000 children have been out of school, nearly 30% of the school-aged population in the state of Louisiana.<ref name="school-flood-update">{{cite web|last1=Dreilinger|first1=Danielle|title=Flood update: 3 in 10 of Louisiana children may have had schools closed|url=http://www.nola.com/weather/index.ssf/2016/08/louisiana_flood_children_schoo.html|website=NOLA.com – The Times-Picayune|accessdate=August 22, 2016|date=2016-08-20}}</ref> There were reports that 6 schools were heavily flooded in [[East Baton Rouge Parish Public Schools|East Baton Rouge Parish]] with another 15 in [[Livingston Parish Public Schools|Livingston Parish]].<ref name="ebr-schools">{{cite web|last1=Lussier|first1=Charles|title=School officials in East Baton Rouge assessing flood damage, deciding when to resume classes|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/education/article_6973cd16-629a-11e6-9db3-8b0e9319ef1c.html|website=The Advocate (Louisiana Newspaper)|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}</ref><ref name="livingston-schools">{{cite web|last1=Lussier|first1=Charles|title=Livingston schools hit worst in flooding, but is not alone|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/education/article_41d5e010-63c5-11e6-96e2-a389d8742e7a.html|website=The Advocate (Louisiana Newspaper)|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}</ref>

Livingston Parish's Superintendent, Rick Wentzel, believes that their school system is in a similar position to the [[St. Tammany Parish Public Schools|Northshore]] following [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, and he held a meeting with the school district to discuss possible options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbrz.com/news/fifteen-livingston-parish-schools-damaged-by-water-some-up-to-8-feet/|title=Fifteen Livingston Parish schools damaged by water; Some up to 8 feet|last=Schmaltz|first=Trey|access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref> Livingston Parish conducted a teacher survey August 23–24, and a parent survey August 25 to assess how those are affected, and on Friday, August 26, 2016, Superintendent Rick Wentzel announced that Livingston Parish Public Schools will be resuming class on September 12, 2016.  Wentzel, who was affected by the flooding himself, said he was "very pleased" that all schools will be resuming together.  The late restart date is because LPPS received the most extensive damage with eight of the 15 flooded schools having "extensive damage."  Wentzel said that each school will have a welcome back event for parents and students before returning on September 12, 27 school days following the August 4 start date.  Wentzel said that the restart will have some unfortunate "side effects" as some schools will be temporarily platooned.  The platooned schools were [[Denham Springs High School]] at [[Live Oak High School (Louisiana)|Live Oak High School]], [[Denham Springs Freshman High School|Denham Springs Freshman High]] at Live Oak Middle School, Southside Junior High at Juban Parc High School, and Springfield High School at Springfield Middle School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lpsb.org/UserFiles/Servers/Server_546/File/2016-08%20Livingston%20Parish%20Students%20to%20Return%20to%20School%20%20on%20Sept%2012.pdf|title=Livingston Parish Students to Return to School on Sept. 12|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=August 31, 2016}}</ref>  All host schools were in session from 6:30 am until 11:40 am and all platooned schools were in session from 12:25 pm until 5:37 pm.  The two elementary schools were in class alongside their relocated school.  Denham Springs Elementary was split among Eastside Elementary (Grades: PreK, K, 1, 2) and Freshwater Elementary (Grades: 3, 4, 5) while Southside Elementary was split among Lewis Vincent Elementary (Grades: PreK, K, 1) and Juban Parc Elementary (Grades: 2, 3, 4, 5).  This announcement also came with Superintendent Wentzel saying ALL students will receive free lunch until September 30.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbrz.com/news/livingston-parish-schools-relocations-announced-for-sept-12-return|title=Livingston Parish Schools relocations announced for Sept. 12 return|last=WBRZ|access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref>  Following a school board meeting on Thursday, September 9, Assistant Superintendent Stephen Parill announced the "known and confident updates" for the 2016 Academic Calendar.  Only four changes were made to the calendar that include: changing Thursday, September 15 from a half-day to a whole day, removing the parish fair holiday on Friday, October 7 (the fair was cancelled due to the flooding), removing a parent-teacher conference day on Thursday, October 20, and making Wednesday, November 16 a whole day instead of a half-day.  The board also voted to add class time to the day.  Parill said they are still waiting on their appeal to Louisiana BESE waiving the required minutes of class, and any further changes will be made after BESE's ruling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbrz.com/news/livingston-parish-school-board-approves-added-class-time-to-2016-academic-calendar|title=Livingston Parish School Board approves added class time to 2016 Academic Calendar|last=Couvillon|first=Trey|date=|website=WBRZ|publisher=|access-date=September 9, 2016}}</ref>

=== Economic impact  ===

Damages were anticipated to reach $10–15 billion, with this storm likely ranking as the seventh most expensive of natural disasters in the US since 1978.<ref name=AdvocateSept2016 />

Because many of the areas that flooded were not in "high flood risk areas," the majority of homeowners affected by the flood did not have [[flood insurance]]. Across Louisiana, about 21% of all structures have coverage under the [[National Flood Insurance Program]]. Despite this, in many parishes that percentage is much lower. In [[St. Helena Parish, Louisiana|St. Helena Parish]], which was among the hardest hit parishes by the floods, less than 1% of all homeowners had flood insurance.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Calder|first1=Chad|title=Only 1 in 8 EBR residents have flood insurance, meaning many will likely bear brunt of losses|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/article_8c8255ec-6336-11e6-aa27-63945b489f7e.html|accessdate=August 19, 2016 |newspaper=The Advocate|date=August 15, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Larino|first1=Jennifer|title=How will Louisiana flooding affect insurance rates?|url=http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2016/08/louisiana_flood_maps_rate_chan.html|website=nola.com|accessdate=August 19, 2016|date=2016-08-19}}</ref>
