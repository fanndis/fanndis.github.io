"'''{{'}}03 Bonnie & Clyde'''" is a song recorded by American [[Rapping|rapper]] [[Jay-Z]] featuring his then-girlfriend, American singer [[Beyoncé|Beyoncé Knowles]]. It was composed by Shawn Carter, [[Kanye West]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince Nelson]], [[Tupac Shakur]], Darryl Harper, Ricky Rouse and [[Tyrone Wrice]] for Jay-Z's seventh [[studio album]] ''[[The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse]]'' (2002). The song was released as the album's [[lead single]] on October 10, 2002. A [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song, "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] its [[Beat (music)|beat]] from American [[Rapping|rapper]] [[Tupac Shakur]]'s 1996 song "Me and My Girlfriend", paraphrasing its chorus, and was inspired by the [[crime film]] ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. The [[instrumentation]] is based on [[Programming (music)|programmed]] [[drum]]s, [[bass instrument]]s, and a [[flamenco guitar]].

"'03 Bonnie & Clyde" was generally received with favorable reviews by [[music critics]], who complimented the combination of Jay-Z's and Beyoncé's musical styles, their collaboration and the song's production. The single reached number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Jay-Z's second top ten single and Beyoncé's first as a solo artist. It charted at number two in the United Kingdom and peaked in the top twenty in other European territories. "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA).

The accompanying [[music video]] was directed by [[Chris Robinson (director)|Chris Robinson]], and features Jay-Z and Beyoncé playing a modern-day version of the 1920s bank robbers [[Bonnie and Clyde|Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker]]. It was nominated for Best Hip-Hop Video at the [[2003 MTV Video Music Awards]]. "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" spawned a feud with American recording artist [[Toni Braxton]], who had also sampled "Me and My Girlfriend" in her 2002 song "Me & My Boyfriend". She accused West and Jay-Z of stealing the idea of using the song as a sample, which was later denied by both of them. "{{'}}03 Bonnie & Clyde" was performed by Jay-Z and Beyoncé on several television shows and was later included on the [[set list]] of their concert performances and tours, most notably on their co-headlining [[On the Run Tour (Beyoncé and Jay-Z)|On the Run]] and [[On the Run II Tour|On the Run II]] tours.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-06-07|title=Here Are All the Songs Beyoncé & JAY-Z Played on the Opening Night of the On the Run II Tour|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8459824/beyonce-jay-z-on-the-run-II-tour-setlist|access-date=2020-08-14|website=Billboard}}</ref>

The music video begins as police officers and Reddick discuss the criminal duo and ways to catch them. As the song begins, Jay-Z is seen driving a gunmetal grey [[Aston Martin]] while Beyoncé sits in the passenger seat.<ref name="google5"/> As they drive through the sepia sands of Mexico,<ref name="google5"/> clips of the police from the beginning of the video are cut into the scene. As Jay-Z and Beyoncé pull over to a hotel, they cover the car to avoid notice from the police.

Scenes of Beyoncé and Jay-Z at a Mexican bar are inter-cut with scenes of an intimate time in a phone-booth; behind the phone booth, spray-painted onto a wall is a tribute to Tupac Shakur. The duo again elude the police who are following one step behind. After Beyoncé performs her verse in an empty pool, the police form a blockade on the highway in an attempt to catch her and Jay-Z, only to be stumped again as two gas station attendant decoys are found driving the car.<ref name="google5"/> The video ends as Beyoncé and Jay-Z light a [[bonfire]] on the beach and drive away in a different car.

On October 8, 2002, [[Toni Braxton]] and her team released a statement claiming that Jay-Z's song "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" had stolen Braxton's idea to sample the 1996 Tupac Shakur song "Me and My Girlfriend".<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Braxton sampled Shakur's song on the track "Me & My Boyfriend", included on Braxton's album, ''[[More Than a Woman (album)|More Than a Woman]]'' (2002). In a call to a New York radio station, hosted by [[Wendy Williams]], Braxton stated that "Jay-Z and Beyoncé are messing with my money. They're trying to steal my mojo".<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Braxton said her song was recorded over the summer of 2002, and alleged that Jay-Z only decided to do "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" after she played her version of the song for [[Def Jam Recordings]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

Kanye West responded to Braxton's claim in an interview for MTV News, "I had no idea about Toni Braxton's [song]. She can't act like ain't nobody ever heard 'Me and My Girlfriend' before. People hear the song all the time. I can [understand her complaint] if it [was] an original song."<ref name="autogenerated1"/> West defended the song's sample, stating that the idea came to him after listening to a friend's Makaveli album one night.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> [[Roc-A-Fella Records]]' Co-CEO [[Damon Dash]] responded to Braxton's claims:
{{quote|Jay is a talented dude. I don't think he would steal anything intentionally. It's an ill coincidence, and things happen for a reason. We'll see what happens behind it... I read it in the paper, and Jay and I were talking about it this morning and it was a little funny. I know he didn't intentionally make the same record she made. I don't think he even heard it. [My] reaction is, 'Sorry, it wasn't intentional.' Jay makes records and puts them out. This [sh--] is music. It's just music. We don't sit around and have a blueprint to [f---] anybody's life up. The music business has been good to us. I'm not getting into any beef or nothing over music.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>}}

Speaking for MTV News, Jay-Z responded to Braxton's claims: "I wouldn't want to take it from her. I don't even think like that. My first thought would be, 'Maybe I could call her up, maybe I could get on that record.' The most obvious [explanation] is it's neither one of our records. It's not like you made an original idea. She's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. We go to sample the same thing and my record came out first. I'm sorry. What can I do?"<ref name="mvd"/> He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.<ref name="autogenerated4"/>
