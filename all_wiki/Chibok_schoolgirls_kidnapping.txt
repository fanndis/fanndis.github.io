==Background==
{{main|Boko Haram insurgency}}
The terrorist group [[Boko Haram]] wants to institute an Islamic [[caliphate]] in Nigeria and is in particular opposed to western-style modern education, which they say lures people away from following Islamic teaching as a way of life.<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news|title=Extremist attack in Nigeria kills 42 at boarding school|first=Damien|last=McElroy|date=6 July 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/nigeria/10163942/Extremist-attack-in-Nigeria-kills-42-at-boarding-school.html|access-date=3 October 2013}}</ref> By 2014, tens of thousands of people had been killed in attacks perpetrated by the group, and the Nigerian federal government declared a state of emergency in May 2013 in [[Borno State|Borno]], Yobe and Adamawa states in its fight against the insurgency.<ref name=AFP>{{cite news |title=Nigeria school attack claims 42 lives|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|work=[[The Australian]]|date=6 July 2013|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/nigeria-school-attack-claims-42-lives/story-e6frg6so-1226675417375|access-date=3 October 2013}}</ref> The resulting crackdown led to the capture or killing of hundreds of Boko Haram members, with the remainder retreating to mountainous areas from which they began increasingly to target civilians.<ref name=Newsday>{{cite news|last1 =Adamu|first1=Adamu|last2=Faul|first2=Michelle|title=School attack kills 30 in northeast Nigeria|date=6 June 2013|agency=Associated Press|work=Newsday |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/30-killed-in-school-attack-in-nigeria-1.5638194|access-date=3 October 2013}}</ref> However, the campaign failed to stabilise the country.

Boko Haram began to target schools in 2010, killing hundreds of students by 2014.

[[Jonathan N.C. Hill]] of King's College London, has pointed out that Boko Haram kidnapped these girls after coming increasingly under the influence of [[al-Qaeda]] in the Islamic Maghreb, and asserts that the group's goal is to use girls and young women as sexual objects and as a means of intimidating the civilian population into compliance.  Hill describes the attacks as similar to kidnapping of girls in Algeria in the 1990s and early 2000s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Jonathan N.C.|title=Boko Haram, the Chibok Abductions and Nigeria's Counterterrorism Strategy|journal=Combatting Terrorism Center at West Point|date=30 July 2014|url=https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/boko-haram-the-chibok-abductions-and-nigerias-counterterrorism-strategy|access-date=4 September 2014}}</ref><ref>Marina Lazreg, "Consequences of Political Liberalisation and Sociocultural Mobilisation for Women in Algeria, Egypt and Jordan," in Anne-Marie Goetz, Governing Women: Women’s Political Effectiveness in Contexts of Democratisation and Governance Reform (New York: Routledge/UNRISD, 2009), p. 47.</ref>

The ''Guardian'' reported that the [[Royal Air Force|British Royal Air Force]] conducted Operation Turus in response to the Chibok schoolgirls' kidnapping by [[Boko Haram]] in [[Nigeria]] in April 2014. A source involved with the Operation told the ''Observer'' that "The girls were located in the first few weeks of the RAF mission," and that "We [RAF] offered to rescue them, but the Nigerian government declined," this was because it viewed the matter as a "national issue" to be resolved by Nigerian intelligence and security services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/04/nigeria-declined-uk-offer-to-rescue-chibok-girls|title=Nigeria rejected British offer to rescue seized Chibok schoolgirls|publisher=the Guardian|date=4 March 2017}}</ref>

On 29 May 2015, Nigerian President [[Muhammadu Buhari]] in his [[Inauguration of Muhammadu Buhari|inaugural address]] to the nation said that they could not claim to "have defeated Boko Haram without rescuing the Chibok girls and all other innocent persons held hostage by insurgents.

On 12 June 2015, two weeks after President Buhari was sworn in, he and his wife [[Aisha Muhammadu Buhari]], and the Vice President's wife Mrs. [[Dolapo Osinbajo]] met with some mothers of the abducted Chibok girls, a meeting Mrs. Buhari had wanted to hold for a long time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dailypost.ng/2015/06/13/tears-as-aisha-buhari-mrs-osinbajo-meet-mothers-of-chibok/|work=[[Daily Post (Nigeria)|Daily Post]]|title=Tears as Aisha Buhari, Mrs Osinbajo meet mothers of Chibok=June 13, 2015|first=Ali|last=Adoyi}}</ref>

On 1 October 2015 the Nigerian Military said it would not be in a hurry to rescue the secondary schoolgirls in Chibok who were abducted in April 2014.
The Acting Director, Defence Information, Military Headquarters, Abuja, Col. Rabe Abubakar, who said this at a press conference in Lagos on Thursday,{{When|date=May 2017}} noted that while it was of utmost concern to the military to rescue the girls, the operation required demanded adequate patience and planning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenews.ng/metro/we-wont-rush-to-rescue-chibok-girls-%E2%94%80army|title=We won't rush to rescue Chibok girls ─Army|date=1 October 2015|publisher=thenews.ng|work=Opemipo Adeniyi|access-date=2 October 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223113045/https://thenews.ng/metro/we-wont-rush-to-rescue-chibok-girls-%E2%94%80army/|archive-date=23 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On the 600th day of the Chibok girls' abduction, a group of Nigeria experts in the United Kingdom called Nigeria Diaspora Security Forum called on the Federal Government of Nigeria under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari to set up a special taskforce tasked solely with the responsibility of looking for the girls.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Nigeria: Group Wants Special Taskforce On Boko Haram|url = http://allafrica.com/stories/201601270043.html|website = allAfrica.com|access-date = 31 January 2016}}</ref>

In 2016 one newspaper article commented that the international publicity for the Chibok schoolgirls has ironically made it more difficult to free the girls.<ref name="Lamb"/> A Nigerian military commander based in [[Maiduguri]] commented "Boko Haram sees the Chibok girls as their trump card. We think they are keeping them with their main leadership.

The fifth anniversary of Chibok school abduction in 2019 marked the vulnerability of schoolchildren to such attacks and abductions, since the whereabouts of 112 girls still remain missing. [[Human Rights Watch]] research claims that the abductions done by Boko Haram started prior to the Chibok incident and have continued ever since. “Boko Haram continues to prey on women and girls as spoils of war despite claims by the Nigerian government that it has defeated the group,” said Human Rights Watch's Nigeria researcher.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/04/15/nigeria-5-years-after-chibok-children-still-risk|title=Nigeria: 5 Years After Chibok, Children Still at Risk|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=15 April 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Bring Back Our Girls in Spain.jpg|thumb|The social media movement resulted in offline protests around the world, including this one in Spain. ]]
Numerous celebrities were photographed holding up signs in photographs showing support for the Bring Back our Girls movement, including [[Salma Hayek]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Antonio Banderas]], [[Gerard Butler]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Wesley Snipes]], [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Ronda Rousey]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Simon Baker]], [[Ricky Martin]], [[Eva Longoria]], [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Demi Moore]],  [[Ben Stiller]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Sean Combs]], [[Kim Kardashian]], [[Beyonce]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Anne Hathaway]], and [[Malala Yousafzai]].{{citation need|date=May 2017}}

Notably, Beyoncé had a separate section on her website that was dedicated to the movement.
