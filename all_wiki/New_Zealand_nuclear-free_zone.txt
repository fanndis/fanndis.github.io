==Historical background==
Initial seeds were sown for [[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987|New Zealand's 1987 nuclear free zone legislation]] in the late 1950s with the formation of the local [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (NZ)|Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) organisation between 1957 and 1959.<ref>Elsie Locke, Peace People: A History of Peace Activities in New Zealand, p. 164</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.converge.org.nz/abc/elsobit.htm|title=OBITUARY|website=www.converge.org.nz|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref> In 1959, responding to rising public concern following the British hydrogen bomb tests in Australia and the Pacific, New Zealand voted in the UN to condemn nuclear testing while the UK, US and France voted against, and Australia abstained.<ref>{{cite web

In 1963, the Auckland CND campaign submitted its 'No Bombs South of the Line' petition to the New Zealand parliament with 80,238 signatures calling on the government to sponsor an international conference to discuss establishing a nuclear-free-zone in the southern hemisphere. It was the biggest petition in the nation since the one in 1893 which demanded that women must have the right to vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.disarmsecure.org/publications/papers/Ordinary_Citizens_as_Peacemakers.php |title=Ordinary Citizens as Peacemakers |last=Dewes |first=Kate |author-link=Kate Dewes |date=11 November 2004|work=Paper presented to 'Push for Peace' Conference, Auckland, 11 November 2004|publisher=Disarmament and Security Centre, Christchurch|accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Moruroa atoll.JPG|thumb|[[Moruroa|Mururoa]]]]

[[Moruroa|Mururoa]] atoll, and its sister atoll [[Fangataufa]], in [[French Polynesia]] in the southern [[Pacific Ocean]] were officially established as a nuclear test site by [[France]] on 21 September 1962 and extensive [[nuclear testing]] occurred between 1966 and 1996. The first nuclear test, codenamed [[Aldebaran]], was conducted on 2 July 1966 and forty-one atmospheric nuclear tests were conducted at Mururoa between 1966 and 1974.

In March 1976 over 20 [[Anti-nuclear movement|anti nuclear]] and [[Environmentalism|environmental groups]], including [[Greenpeace]] and [[Friends of the Earth]], met in [[Wellington]] and formed a loose coalition called the Campaign for Non-Nuclear Futures (CNNF).  The coalition's mandate was to oppose the introduction of [[nuclear power]] and to promote [[Renewable energy|renewable energy alternatives]] such as [[Wind power|wind]], [[Wave power|wave]], [[Solar energy|solar]] and [[geothermal power]]. They launched Campaign Half Million. CNNF embarked on a national education exercise producing the largest petition against nuclear power in New Zealand's history with 333,087 signatures by October 1976. This represented over 10% of the country's total population of 3 million.<ref name = Szabo /><ref>http://www.lcnp.org/disarmament/nwfz/NewZealandExperience.htm\</ref> At this time, New Zealand's only nuclear reactor was a small sub-critical reactor that had been installed at the School of Engineering of the [[University of Canterbury]] in 1962. It had been given by the United States' [[Atoms for Peace]] programme and was used for training electrical engineers in nuclear techniques. It was dismantled in 1981.<ref>{{cite news

Regional anti-nuclear sentiment was consolidated in 1985 when eight of the thirteen [[Pacific Islands Forum|South Pacific Forum]] nations signed the South Pacific [[Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone]] Treaty or [[Treaty of Rarotonga]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/spnfz/text/spnfz.htm|title=South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty|website=fas.org|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref>

==Mururoa protests==
Community inspired anti-nuclear sentiments largely contributed to the [[New Zealand Labour Party]] election victory under [[Norman Kirk]] in 1972. In June 1973, the [[International Court of Justice]] (pursuant to a case launched by [[Australia]] and New Zealand) ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at [[Moruroa|Mururoa]] atoll while the case was being heard by the Court.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://legacy.disarmsecure.org/publications/papers/legal_challenges_to_nuclear_weapons_from_aotearoa_new_zealand.php|title=Legal Challenges to Nuclear Weapons from Aotearoa/New Zealand |last=Dewes|first=Kate|author-link=Kate Dewes |publisher=Disarmament and Security Centre, Christchurch|access-date=14 July 2019}}</ref> However, the French ignored this ruling.

Mururoa was the site of numerous protests by various vessels, including the ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1978)|Rainbow Warrior]]''.  In a symbolic act of protest the Kirk government sent two of its navy [[frigate]]s, {{HMNZS|Canterbury|F421|6}} and {{HMNZS|Otago|F111|2}}, into the test zone area in 1973.<ref>[http://www.mururoavet.com/ Mururoa Nuclear Tests, RNZN protest Veterans - Home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723050155/http://www.mururoavet.com/ |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> A [[Cabinet Minister]] ([[Fraser Colman]]) was randomly selected to accompany this official New Zealand Government protest fleet. This voyage included a number of local [[Kiwi (people)|kiwi]] [[peace]] organisations who had organised an international flotilla of protest yachts that accompanied the frigates into the [[Mururoa]] zone. Many of the early NZ peace activists and organisations were enthusiastic young [[hippies]] and students, many of whom were involved with the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counter-culture]] and the original [[opposition to the Vietnam War]] movements.<ref>Elsa Caron, (ed.) 1974, Fri Alert (Caveman Press, Dunedin) The yacht Fri's own story of her protest voyage into the French Bomb Test Zone.</ref>

Peace yachts attempting to disrupt the French tests sailed in coordinated protests through the Mururoa exclusion zones between 1972–1991. These included the voyage of the first joint [[Greenpeace]]-[[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|CND]] campaign in 1972 with [[David McTaggart]], (who co-founded Greenpeace), on the yacht Vega (renamed Greenpeace III). This was followed in 1973 by a flotilla of yachts organised by the Peace Media with protest yachts [[Fri (yacht)|Fri]], Spirit of Peace, the Boy Roel, Magic Isle and the Tanmure.<ref name = Szabo >{{cite book

During numerous voyages to [[Moruroa|Mururoa]] atoll the protest yachts ''Fri'', ''Vegas'' and [[MV Greenpeace|''Greenpeace'']] were boarded by French commandos and members of their crew assaulted and arrested. In 1973 the ''Vega'' was rammed by a French military [[warship]] and David McTaggart was severely beaten by French military police.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983452,00.html | work=Time | title=Dead-Serious Prank: A Greenpeace Operation | date=18 September 1995 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> A major change in New Zealand society caused by these Pacific campaigns was the upsurge in pro anti-nuclear sentiments in New Zealand and, as a consequence, the eventual rise of its anti-nuclear policy in 1987.

According to French [[journalist]] Luis Gonzales-Mata in Actual magazine 1976, large numbers of Polynesians had been secretly sent on military flights to Paris for treatment for [[cancer]]. [[Tahitian people|Tahitian]] [[activist]] Charlie Ching told a nuclear-free Pacific [[Hui (Māori assembly)|hui]] in [[Auckland]] in 1983 that more than 200 Tahitians had died from [[radiation]]-linked illnesses over 5 years. Due to the secrecy of health issues in French Polynesia, these figures remained impossible to confirm.<ref name = Szabo />

==Nuclear-free zone legislation==
Despite the steady growth of the nuclear-free movement since the 1950s, the early 1980s [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] government was completely against tighter nuclear restrictions and instead sought closer ties with the United States, New Zealand's most powerful ally who possessed the largest nuclear arsenal in the world.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Clements|first=Kevin P.|year=1988|title=New Zealand's Role in Promoting a Nuclear-free Pacific|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=25|issue=4|pages=395–410|doi=10.1177/002234338802500406|jstor=424007}}</ref> Prime Minister [[Robert Muldoon]] had lost the support of some of the MPs from his own party over several environmental issues. In particular, maverick National Party Members of Parliament [[Marilyn Waring]] and [[Mike Minogue]] threatened the slight government majority. In 1984, the opposition [[New Zealand Labour Party]] proposed the nuclear-free zone legislation. Muldoon strongly opposed the proposal, fearing it might compromise New Zealand's [[national security]]. However, as he failed to secure Marilyn Waring's support on the issue, and as the National Party had a majority of only one, Muldoon decided to call a snap election, the [[1984 New Zealand general election]], stating that Waring's "feminist anti-nuclear stance" threatened his ability to govern. Muldoon was famously drunk when he announced the election, and ignored warnings from party president [[Sue Wood]] that the party organisation was unprepared for a campaign. The National Party lost the election, and the Labour Party formed a new government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.national.org.nz/About/history.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416120337/http://www.national.org.nz/About/history.aspx |archivedate=16 April 2014}}</ref><ref>Gustafson, Barry, ''His Way, a biography of Robert Muldoon'', Auckland University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|1-86940-236-7}}, p. 375</ref>
[[File:David Lange (cropped).jpg|thumb|150px|Prime Minister [[David Lange]] worked towards forging anti-nuclear sentiment as part of New Zealand's self-identity.]]
According to opinion polls taken before the 1984 election, 30 per cent of New Zealanders supported visits by US warships with a clear majority of 58 per cent opposed, and over 66 per cent of the population lived in locally declared nuclear free zones.<ref name=":1" /> Following the victory of the New Zealand Labour Party in elections in 1984, Prime Minister [[David Lange]] barred [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] or [[nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] ships from using New Zealand ports or entering New Zealand waters.  Reasons given were the dangers of nuclear weapons, continued nuclear testing in the South Pacific, and opposition to US President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s policy of aggressively confronting the Soviet Union. Given that the United States Navy refused to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons aboard ships, these laws essentially refused access to New Zealand ports for all United States Navy ships. In February 1985, a port-visit request by the United States for the [[USS Buchanan (DDG-14)|USS ''Buchanan'']] was refused by the New Zealand government on the basis that the ''Buchanan'' was capable of launching [[nuclear depth bomb]]s. This refusal was viewed by the New Zealand public as an important statement of national sovereignty, illustrating a refusal to relax its anti-nuclear stance even at the behest of its more powerful allies.<ref name=":0" /> An opinion poll commissioned by the 1986 Defence Committee of Enquiry confirmed that 92 per cent now opposed nuclear weapons in New Zealand and 69 per cent opposed warship visits; 92 per cent wanted New Zealand to promote nuclear disarmament through the UN, while 88 per cent supported the promotion of nuclear free zones.<ref name=":1" />

Under the [[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987]]<ref name=autogenerated6 /><ref>[[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987]],</ref> territorial sea and land of New Zealand became nuclear free zones.  The Act prohibits "entry into the internal waters of New Zealand 12 n. mi. (22.2&nbsp;km/13-13/16 st. mi.) radius by any ship whose propulsion is wholly or partly dependent on nuclear power" and bans the dumping of radioactive waste into the sea within the nuclear-free zone, as well as prohibiting any New Zealand citizen or resident "to manufacture, acquire, possess, or have any control over any nuclear explosive device." Similar provisions were made for biological weapons.<ref name=autogenerated6 /><ref name=autogenerated4 /> This act also enabled the New Zealand government to ensure that only unambiguously non-nuclear ships reached New Zealand's shores, making the British and American policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons or nuclear power aboard specific ships obsolete.<ref name=":0" /> After this Act was passed by the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] government of [[David Lange]], the [[United States]] government suspended its [[ANZUS]] obligations to New Zealand. The United States government viewed their nuclear weapons as an integral part of their armed forces and as such regarded any anti-nuclear efforts as anti-American.<ref name=":0" /> With New Zealand taking the major step to ban nuclear weapons from entering New Zealand waters the United States felt that it was important to punish New Zealand quite severely to stop any other allies from following suit.<ref name=":0" /> Following consultations with Australia and after negotiations with New Zealand broke down, the United States reiterated that it was suspending its treaty obligations until United States Navy ships were re-admitted to New Zealand ports, citing that New Zealand was "a friend, but not an ally".<ref>{{cite book|title=Nuclear Free: The New Zealand Way|first=David|last=Lange|date=1 May 1991|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn = 978-0140145199}}</ref> The crisis made front-page headlines for weeks in many American newspapers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/fridriksson.rtf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220134021/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/fridriksson.rtf |archivedate=20 February 2011}}</ref> while many leading American senators were quoted as expressing a deep sense of betrayal.<ref name=autogenerated5>[http://www.newsweekly.com.au/articles/2002nov02_nz1.html NEW ZEALAND: US links free trade to repeal of NZ nuclear ships ban - 2 November 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415060447/http://www.newsweekly.com.au/articles/2002nov02_nz1.html |date=15 April 2010 }}</ref> However, David Lange did not withdraw New Zealand from ANZUS, although his government's policy led to the US's decision to suspend its treaty obligations to New Zealand. The legislation was a milestone in New Zealand's development as a nation and seen as an important act of sovereignty, self-determination and cultural identity.<ref name=autogenerated8 /><ref name=autogenerated1 /> Further, many were driven by a sense of responsibility to support peace and the rights of all humans, not just in New Zealand, but worldwide.<ref>[http://publicaddress.net/default,2424.sm#post Public Address | Great New Zealand Argument]</ref>

New Zealand has long maintained an independent [[foreign policy]] initiative,<ref>http://www.stuff.co.nz/4091494a6160.html</ref> with various Governments ignoring American and other countries' policy demands.  While New Zealand meets its international responsibilities towards maintaining global peace, its [[pacifist]] based [[anti-nuclear]] stance reflects the mainstream ideology held by the majority of its residents. New Zealand's opposition to nuclear weapons is rooted in the belief that the proliferation of such [[weapons of mass destruction]] does not reflect an attempt to preserve peace in the form of a [[Mutual assured destruction|nuclear deterrent]]. New Zealand's nuclear-free zone option looks to remove the nation from under the nuclear umbrella.<ref>[http://www.publicaddress.net/default,1578.sm;jsessionid=AE10F7D2085F6B1659F90FF34C624815.t1?ppid=1578&start=1#post Public Address | Great New Zealand Argument]</ref>

It is often speculated that the [[sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|sinking of the ''Rainbow Warrior'']] was an act of revenge against Greenpeace and New Zealanders themselves for their successful campaigns to enforce a nuclear weapons test ban at [[Moruroa|Mururoa]].<ref>[http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/about/bombing-of-the-rainbow-warrior] Greepeace account of rainbow Warrior sinking</ref> When the French [[DGSE]] agents Commander [[Alain Mafart]] and Captain [[Dominique Prieur]] were captured in New Zealand and eventually sentenced to 10 years prison for their roles in [[sabotage]] of the ''Rainbow Warrior'' and [[manslaughter]] of [[Fernando Pereira]], the French government threatened New Zealand with trade sanctions to the European Economic Community if the pair were not released.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/jul/15/activists.g2 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Felling of a Warrior | first=Paul | last=Brown | date=15 July 2005 | accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/rw/pkspy.html The French Secret Service Agents - Where Are They Now?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205181051/http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/rw/pkspy.html |date=5 February 2012 }}</ref>

==Impact on diplomatic relationships==

===The United States===

New Zealand's nuclear movement had a huge impact on diplomatic relationships with the United States. On 4 February 1985, Prime Minister [[David Lange]] declined a visit from the nuclear-capable [[USS Buchanan (DDG-14)|USS ''Buchanan'']] destroyer.<ref name="nzhistory.govt.nz">{{cite web|title=USS Buchanan refused entry to New Zealand|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/uss-buchanan-refused-entry-new-zealand|website=NZ History|accessdate=23 May 2018}}</ref> The United States responded swiftly and stopped all intelligence flow to New Zealand.<ref name="nzhistory.govt.nz"/> When the Labour government turned their policy into law with the [[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987]], New Zealand was effectively frozen out of [[ANZUS]] by the United States. New Zealand's diplomatic position was downgraded from being an ally to a "friend".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Patman|first1=Robert|last2=Kiglics|first2=Balazs|title=New Zealand and the World: Past, Present And Future|year=2018|publisher=World Scientific|location=New Jersey}}</ref> [[Robert Muldoon]] called the Act the "ANZUS termination bill".<ref>{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Robert|title=Nuclear Free New Zealand: 1987 – From Policy to Legislation|year=1998|publisher=Centre for Peace Studies|location=University of Auckland|ref=Working Paper no. 8}}</ref> Certain American newspapers launched attacks on New Zealand's non-nuclear policy. The ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', for instance, remarked that 'we hope the Socialist bums ensconced in Wellington will get thrown out as they predictably botch both the domestic and foreign policy of a great nation.'<ref>Hugh Neville, 'US Rumbles Continue Over N-Ship Warning,’ The Press, 19 February 1985, quoted in Paul Lan -

Despite this conflict, the bilateral trade and cultural relationship between the United States and New Zealand continued to flourish. The proportion of United States imports and exports in 1990 were greater than in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|last1=United States New Zealand Council|title=History of US – NZ Relations|url=http://usnzcouncil.org/us-nz-issues/us-nz-relations/|accessdate=23 May 2018}}</ref> Today, the ban on nuclear arms is no longer a factor straining United States and New Zealand diplomatic relations.

The French attack on the ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1978)|Rainbow Warrior]]'' "produced a sense of outrage and a serious deterioration in relations between New Zealand and France".<ref name="Nuclear-free New Zealand">{{cite web|last1=NZ History|title=Nuclear-free New Zealand|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/nuclear-free-new-zealand/rainbow-warrior|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref> 
France demanded New Zealand release the agents captured after the attack. To enforce their demand, the French Government threatened to strain New Zealand's access to the European Economic market, and New Zealand exports to France were boycotted.<ref>{{cite web|last1=NZ History|title=Sinking the Rainbow Warrior|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/nuclear-free-new-zealand/rainbow-warrior|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref> Almost a year after the bombing, on 8 July 1986, United Nations Secretary-General [[Javier Perez de Cuellar]] announced, that New Zealand would receive an apology and compensation of $13 million from France.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Armstrong|first1=John|title=Reality behind the Rainbow Warrior outrage|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10333759|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=24 May 2018|date=2 July 2005}}</ref> The attackers, Dominique Prieur and Alain Mafart were to serve their sentences in full on Hao Atoll in French Polynesia.

===Australia===

New Zealand has a very close and significant relationship with Australia.<ref name="Australia">{{cite web|last1=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade|title=Australia|url=https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/countries-and-regions/australia/|accessdate=23 May 2018}}</ref> When New Zealand passed the [[New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987]], Australia found itself torn between not offending its longstanding ally (New Zealand) and upsetting its more strategic relationship with the United States.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|last1=Clements|first1=Kevin|title=New Zealand's Role in Promoting a Nuclear-Free Pacific|journal=Journal of Peace Research|date=December 1988|volume=25|issue=Special Issue on Militarization and Demilitarization in Asia-Pacific}}</ref> The Australian Government was unwilling to adopt New Zealand's nuclear stand.

The end of the ANZUS alliance saw Australia and New Zealand embark on the Closer Defence Relations (CDR) in 1991.<ref name="Australia"/>

===Pacific Islands===

From a Pacific perspective, the military attack on the ''Rainbow Warrior'' only served to consolidate New Zealand's and the Pacific communities' nuclear free zone ambitions. ([[Treaty of Rarotonga]] – South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty). The attack served to further isolate the French in that part of the world, which resulted in strong anti-French political campaigns for independence in [[Tahiti]] (see [[2004 French Polynesian legislative election]]) and [[New Caledonia]] (see [[Politics of New Caledonia]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/news/index.shtml?article=474|title=Eyewitness to the Rainbow Warrior sinking: University of Waikato|first=Communications and External Relations|last=(unipr@waikato.ac.nz)|date=8 July 2005|website=www.waikato.ac.nz|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref>

===Japan===

The breakdown of the [[ANZUS]] treaty placed considerable strain on the relationship between [[Japan]] and New Zealand, as the Japanese government placed importance on New Zealand's relationship with the United States.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The absence of Japanese Prime Ministerial visits to New Zealand between 1982 and 1993 helps illustrate this unease.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Holly|title=New Zealand's Identity and New Zealand-Japan Relations: 1945-2014|url=http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10063/4370/thesis.pdf?sequence=2|website=Victoria University of Wellington|accessdate=23 May 2018|ref=2015}}</ref>

==Significance of the movement==

Jack Vowles, Professor at Victoria University of Wellington, observed that the anti-nuclear movement allowed a "new materialism" to conquer in New Zealand politics.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vowles|first1=Jack|title=Nuclear free New Zealand and rogernomics: The survival of a Labour government|journal=Australian Journal of Political Science|year=1990|volume=25}}</ref> New Zealand's anti-nuclear movement was central to an upsurge in New Zealand nationalism. There was a sense of having to 'go it alone' after the ''Rainbow Warrior'' attack, because traditional allies such as the United States and Britain sat on their hands while France blocked New Zealand exports.<ref name="Nuclear-free New Zealand"/> The nuclear free movement drew attention to the small nation, and allowed New Zealand to create its own foreign policies independent from other countries.

== Anti-nuclear music ==
In 1982, a song called "French Letter" by New Zealand band [[Herbs (band)|Herbs]] came to express the country's anti-nuclear stance. The track, with lyrics telling the French to get out of the Pacific and 'no nukes' became a big hit and spent 11 weeks on the charts. Fourteen years later, it was re-recorded to garner support for the prevention of nuclear testing at [[Moruroa|Mururoa]]. Similarly, "No Nukes (The Second Letter)", "Nuclear Waste" and "Light of the Pacific" expressed much the same sentiment.

Under the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|fifth Labour government]], its [[Prime Minister]] [[Helen Clark]] maintained New Zealand's nuclear-free zone status, a bipartisan position supported by the opposition [[New Zealand National Party]]. In a 2008 survey, 19% of New Zealanders favouring nuclear as a power source, more than both gas and coal power, but well behind wind, solar, geothermal and hydroelectricity.<ref name="TVNZ_1690587">{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/413551/1690587 |title=Nuclear power backed by 19% |date=7 April 2008 |work=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>

The United States wants New Zealand to repeal its nuclear-free legislation, which would then allow U.S. warships carrying nuclear weapons to visit New Zealand ports. Pressure from the United States increased in 2006, with U.S. trade officials linking the repeal of the ban of American nuclear ships from New Zealand's ports to a potential [[New Zealand free-trade agreements|free-trade agreement]] between the two countries.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> In 2004, then opposition leader [[Don Brash]] refused to confirm or deny that he told visiting US senators the nuclear ban would be repealed "by lunchtime" if he was elected prime minister.<ref name="NZ_Herald_3564860">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=3564860 |title=Brash refuses to confirm or deny nuclear comments |date=6 May 2004 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref><ref>http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Debates/Debates/2/5/d/47HansD_20040505_00000757-General-Debates.htm</ref> Brash quit politics after losing the 2005 election and "gone by lunchtime" became a political catchphrase in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gone by lunchtime stoush erupts again|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/253558/gone-by-lunchtime-stoush-erupts-again|accessdate=17 June 2017|work=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=2 September 2014}}</ref>

Differences between the French and New Zealand governments now appear to be resolved with both countries enjoying positive trade and cultural exchanges.

On 8 June 2007 during Parliamentary debate on New Zealand's Nuclear-Free Legislations 20th Anniversary, the Hon [[Phil Goff]] (Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control) reaffirmed his Government's commitment to New Zealand's Nuclear free Zone legislation. Phil Goff said,

<blockquote>I move, That this House note that 8 June 2007 is the 20th anniversary of the passing by this House of the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987 and resolve that New Zealand should continue to work for a nuclear weapon – free world; and that, in striving for a world free of nuclear weapons, the House call for: the implementation and strengthening of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]], including the unequivocal undertaking made by nuclear weapon States in 2000 to move towards the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals; the expansion and strengthening of [[Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone]]s and a nuclear weapon – free Southern Hemisphere; the entry into force of the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]]; the enactment of a [[Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty]]; and the universal implementation of nuclear non-proliferation instruments such as the [[Nuclear terrorism|International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism]] and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/PB/Debates/Debates/1/2/5/48HansD_20070612_00001019-Motions-Nuclear-Free-Legislation-20th-Anniversary.htm|title=New Zealand Parliament - Motions – Nuclear-Free Legislation—20th Anniversary|website=www.parliament.nz|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref></blockquote>

[[John Key]] promised in 2006, just after being elected leader of the National Party, that "the nuclear-free legislation will remain intact" for as long as he is the leader of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]].<ref name="NZ_Herald_10413300">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10413300

In November 2016, {{USS|Sampson|DDG-102}} became the first US warship to call in New Zealand in 33 years.

In 2017, New Zealand signed the United Nations [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]]. The treaty aims to ban nuclear weapons amid tensions over North Korea's nuclear and missile tests. Foreign Affairs Minister [[Gerry Brownlee]] said the treaty is "consistent with New Zealand's long-standing commitment to international nuclear disarmament efforts".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Newshub|title=NZ signs UN anti-nuke treaty|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2017/09/nz-signs-un-anti-nuke-treaty.html|work=Newshub|date=21 September 2017}}</ref>

Also in 2017, a New Zealand led proposal to help identify North Korean ships in Pacific waters was accepted by leaders at the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]. [[Gerry Brownlee]] says he is prepared to use whatever intelligence capacity necessary to help identify and stop North Korean nuclear ships in the Pacific.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Newshub|title=New Zealand to intercept North Korean vessels in Pacific waters|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2017/09/new-zealand-to-intercept-north-korean-vessels-in-pacific-waters.html|work=Newshub|date=9 August 2017}}</ref>

In 2018, New Zealand Prime Minister [[Jacinda Ardern]] reinstated the ministerial portfolio of Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control. Ardern stated that it is important that the Government acknowledges New Zealand's long held anti nuclear stance. "The pursuit of disarmament is as vital today as it was when Norman Kirk and David Lange proclaimed New Zealand's opposition to nuclear weapons and nuclear testing in the Pacific," she said.<ref>{{cite news|last1=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |title=Jacinda Ardern revives disarmament and arms control role to stress anti-nuclear stance|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12002708|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=26 February 2018}}</ref>
