'''Miss Teen USA''' is a [[beauty pageant]] run by the [[Miss Universe Organization]] for girls aged 14–19. Unlike its sister pageants [[Miss Universe]], which currently broadcasts on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and [[Miss USA]], this pageant is [[webcast]] on the Miss Teen USA website and simulcast on mobile devices and video game consoles.

The pageant was first held in 1983 and has been broadcast live on [[CBS]] until 2002 and then on [[NBC]] from 2003 to 2007. In March 2007, it was announced that the broadcast of the Miss Teen USA pageant on NBC had not been renewed, and that [[Miss Teen USA 2007]] would be the final televised event.<ref name=eonline>{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/54769/trump-and-miss-universe-stay-in-bed-with-nbc|title=Trump and Miss Universe Stay in Bed with NBC|first=Sarah|last=Hall|date=March 29, 2007|accessdate=March 29, 2007}}</ref>

From 2008 to 2015, the pageant was held at the [[Atlantis Paradise Island]] Resort, located in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]]. 

Since 2018, the pageant is held concurrently with its sister Miss USA pageant in a single city a few days before the start of Miss USA final competition.{{fact|date=May 2020}}

Notable pageant winners include actresses [[Kelly Hu]] (1985, [[Hawaii]]), [[Bridgette Wilson]] (1990, [[Oregon]]), [[Charlotte Ayanna|Charlotte Lopez-Ayanna]] (1993, [[Vermont]]), [[Vanessa Lachey|Vanessa Minnillo]] (1998, [[South Carolina]]) and  [[Shelley Hennig]] (2004, [[Louisiana]]).

The current titleholder is [[Kiʻilani Arruda]] of [[Hawaii]] who was crowned on November 7, 2020 at [[Graceland]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

==Competition rounds==

Prior to the final telecast the delegates compete in the preliminary competition, which involves private interviews with the judges and a presentation show where they compete in swimsuit and evening gown.

During the final competition, the semi-finalists are announced and go on to compete in swimsuit and evening gown. From 1983 to 2002 all semi-finalists also competed in an interview competition as well as both swimsuit and evening gown, followed by one or two final interview questions. In [[Miss Teen USA 2003|2003]], a new format was introduced where the top fifteen competed in evening gown, the top ten competed in swimsuit and the top five competed in the final question. In [[Miss Teen USA 2006|2006]], the order of competition was changed where the top fifteen competed in swimsuit and the top ten in evening gown. The latest competition format was used since [[Miss Teen USA 2008|2008]] the final not broadcast on TV, where the top fifteen both competed in swimsuit and evening gown, and the top five competed in the final question who all signed up by a panel of judges.

Former Miss Teen USA Katherine Haik supported calls to eliminate the swimsuit competition.<ref name="eliminate">{{cite web |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/miss-teen-usa-pageant-to-eliminate-swimsuit-competition-w211632 |title=Miss Teen USA wants to eliminate swimsuit competition |last=French |first=Megan |date=June 29, 2016 |access-date=June 29, 2016}}</ref> The swimsuit category was chastised for exploiting and sexualizing young women and not promoting diverse body types.

==Broadcasting of the pageant==
===1983–2007: Viewership and later decline===
The pageant's viewership peak was hit in 1988, when the pageant averaged over 22 million viewers on [[CBS]]. Even as recently as 1999, the show managed to bring in over 10 million viewers. The 2006 airing was the second lowest rated in the pageant's 23-year history, with only 5.6 million viewers watching the live broadcast (the lowest: 2004, with 5.34 million).<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_6698.asp|title=Crowning tears: Miss Teen USA skids|magazine=Media Life Magazine|date=August 16, 2006|accessdate=December 22, 2015}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The 2007 telecast (25th Anniversary, scheduled for August 24, 2007) was the last time Miss Teen USA aired live on television.

===2008–present: internet pageant===
The 2008 pageant was held, untelevised, on August 16, 2008. One factor that prevented NBC from broadcasting was its prime time commitment to the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]].
Since then, it is broadcast over the [[Internet]] on the Miss Teen USA website. It can be viewed worldwide, without any region restrictions via [[geolocation]]. Currently, it is hosted by [[YouTube]] ([[Ustream]] from 2008 to 2013). In addition, the webcast can be accessed on the pageant's [[Facebook]] page and on mobile devices using the official Miss Universe mobile app released during [[Miss USA 2016]].{{fact|date=May 2020}}

In 2012, the pageant began to simulcast in selected regions on Microsoft's Xbox Live service, allowing owners of the [[Xbox 360]] (until 2017) and/or [[Xbox One]] [[video game console|console]]s to watch the pageant on a television screen. In 2017, the pageant was also broadcast on [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation Network]] service.{{fact|date=May 2020}}

The 2017 pageant was the first to include both a 360-video option for [[virtual reality]] headsets and [[high-dynamic-range video#HDR10|HDR10]] support for Xbox One S owners. The 2018 pageant featured support for [[Dolby Atmos]] audio and [[4K resolution|4K]] video on the Xbox One S and X consoles.{{fact|date=May 2020}}

==Crossovers with Miss USA==
[[File:KellyHu.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Miss Teen USA 1985 [[Kelly Hu]], seen here on April 17, 2002, became a model and actress.]]

===Miss Teen USA at Miss USA===
In the early years of Miss Teen USA, three winners represented the title "Miss Teen USA" at [[Miss USA]]. The three queens were: Ruth Zakarian (1983), Cherise Haugen (1984), and Allison Brown (1986). This also made history because the Miss USA 1984 pageant had 53 delegates, the most ever in a Miss USA pageant. In 1987, Miss Teen USA 1986, Allison Brown participated in the 1987 Miss USA pageant. All three failed to make the cut at their respective Miss USA pageants.{{fact|date=May 2020}}

Only in the three years mentioned above did Miss Teen USA winners automatically gain representation at [[Miss USA]]. Starting in 1988, if the Miss Teen USA winners want to compete at Miss USA, they first must win a Miss USA state crown. A total of seven Miss Teen USA winners have participated at Miss USA, with four winning their state Miss USA crowns first. The first of these was Kelly Hu, Miss Teen USA 1985, who won the [[Miss Hawaii USA]] 1993 title and represented Hawaii at Miss USA 1993. She finished as a finalist. The next was [[Jamie Solinger]], Miss Teen USA 1992. She took the Miss Iowa USA 1998 title but failed to make the cut at the Miss USA pageant. Only two Miss Teen USA winners have made the top 3 of Miss USA. [[Brandi Sherwood]], Miss Teen USA 1989 won the [[Miss Idaho USA]] 1997 title. Succeeding Kelly, she took 1st runner up and later inherited the Miss USA crown, when [[Brook Mahealani Lee]] of Hawaii won [[Miss Universe]] 1997. She is the only Miss Teen USA winner to hold the title Miss USA. [[Shauna Gambill]] was close in winning the Miss USA 1998 title, but placed 1st runner up to [[Shawnae Jebbia]], [[Miss Massachusetts USA]] 1998. However, to date it has never happened that the same woman had won the 2 separate pageants officially.{{fact|date=May 2020}}

There have been two years when two Miss Teen USA winners participated at Miss USA. The first was 1984, when Miss Teen USA 1983 and Miss Teen USA 1984 participated, the second was 1998, when Jamie Solinger competed as [[Miss Iowa USA]] but went unplaced, and [[Shauna Gambill]] competed as [[Miss California USA]] and placed first runner-up.{{fact|date=May 2020}}

The first Miss Teen USA not to win a Miss USA state pageant on her first attempt was [[Christie Lee Woods]], Miss Teen USA 1996, of Texas, who placed third runner-up in the [[Miss Texas USA]] 2002 pageant. She would also become the first Miss Teen USA to compete for, but never win a Miss USA state title (she also placed as a semi-finalist in 2003 and 2004). The second Miss Teen USA who did not win a Miss USA state title on her first attempt was [[Ashley Coleman]], Miss Teen USA 1999, of Delaware, who competed in the [[Miss California USA]] 2006 pageant and finished third runner-up. She is the first Miss Teen USA winner to compete in a different state from that where she won her Miss Teen USA crown. [[Tami Farrell]], Miss Teen USA 2003, competed at [[Miss California USA]] 2009 as Miss Malibu USA, but failed to win the crown, placing first runner-up to [[Carrie Prejean]]. Farrell competed at Miss Teen USA as [[Miss Oregon Teen USA]], and was one of the few Miss Teen USA winners to try for the state crown outside of the state she represented for Miss Teen USA. In a span of only two years later, [[Miss Teen USA 2006]], [[Katie Blair]] also competed at [[Miss California USA]] 2011. Representing the state of Montana at Miss Teen USA 2006, Blair is only the third Miss Teen USA to compete in a state other than the state she competed in Teen. Similarly to Coleman and Farrell, Blair placed 1st runner up in the pageant, to [[Alyssa Campanella]], who also competed in Miss Teen USA representing New Jersey. Campanella went on to win [[Miss USA 2011]]. [[Danielle Doty]], Miss Teen USA 2011, competed at [[Miss Texas USA]] 2018, who placed in the semifinals.{{fact|date=May 2020}}
