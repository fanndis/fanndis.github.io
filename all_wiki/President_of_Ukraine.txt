{{Politics of Ukraine (small)}}

The '''president of Ukraine''' ({{lang-uk|Президент України}}, ''Prezydent Ukrayiny'') is the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[head of state]]. The president represents the nation in international relations, administers the foreign political activity of the state, conducts negotiations and concludes international treaties. The president is [[direct election|directly elected]] by the [[Ukrainian citizenship|citizens of Ukraine]] for a five-year term of office (whether the [[Ukrainian presidential elections|presidential election]] is early or scheduled), limited to two terms consecutively.<ref name="New Ukrainian president 5-year term"/>

The president's official residence is the [[Mariyinsky Palace]], located in the [[Pecherskyi District|Pechersk]] district of the capital [[Kiev|Kyiv]]. Other official residences include the [[House with Chimaeras]] and the [[House of the Weeping Widow]], which are used for official visits by foreign representatives. The [[Presidential Administration of Ukraine]], unofficially known as "Bankova" in reference to the street it is located on, serves as the presidential administration, advising the president in the domestic, foreign and legal matters.

Since the office's establishment on 5 July 1991, there have been six presidents of Ukraine. [[Leonid Kravchuk]] was the inaugural president, serving three years from 1991 until his resignation in 1994. [[Leonid Kuchma]] was the only president to have served two consecutive terms in office. [[Viktor Yushchenko]], [[Petro Poroshenko]] and [[Viktor Yanukovych]] served one term, with the latter being replaced by [[acting (law)|acting]] president [[Oleksandr Turchynov]], who then also served as [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada|Chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament]], on 21 February 2014.<ref name="speaker">{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/30130.html|title=Resolution of the Verkhovna Rada №764-VII of 23.02.2014 on conferring powers of the president of Ukraine on the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada according to article 112 of the Constitution of Ukraine|work=President of Ukraine's Official website|date=25 February 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405140914/http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/30130.html|archivedate=5 April 2014}}</ref> Oleksandr Turchynov was the only [[acting president]] in Ukraine's modern history.

The current president is [[Volodymyr Zelensky]], who took the oath of office on 20 May 2019.

==Overview==
The president is also the commander-in-chief of the [[Armed Forces of Ukraine|Ukrainian Army]], and heads the [[National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine|National Security and Defense Council]], which advises the president, co-ordinates and controls executive power in the sphere of national security and defense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article?art_id=72956&cat_id=32588|title=President of Ukraine|accessdate=15 December 2008|work=Government portal|publisher=[[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110041119/http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article?art_id=72956&cat_id=32588|archivedate=10 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to the [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 102|Constitution of Ukraine]], the president is the guarantor of the state's [[sovereignty]], territorial indivisibility, the observance of the Constitution of Ukraine and human and citizens' rights and freedoms.

As with the [[separation of powers]], the president has checks on the authority of parliament and the judicial system. For instance, any law passed by the parliament can be vetoed by the president; however, parliament can override his veto with a 2/3 constitutional majority vote. The president has limited [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 90|authority]] to disband the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (parliament), and nominates candidates for the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and Minister of Defense in the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers]]. Six out of eighteen of the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine|Constitutional Court]] judges are appointed by the president. Decisions of the president are subject to review by Ukraine's courts with the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine|Constitutional Court]] having the sole authority and power to declare decrees of the president [[unconstitutional]]. While in office, the president enjoys the right of [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]].

Ukrainian presidents are frequently asked by individual citizens for help in solving their personal problems (sometimes successfully); in 2012, (then) president Yanukovych received about 10,000 to 12,000 letters from people every month.<ref name=helpmeprespm/> By-passing [[Local government in Ukraine|local governments]] is an ages-old practice in Ukraine.<ref name=helpmeprespm>{{cite news|author=Oksana Grytsenko|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/125579/|title=Help Me, Father Czar!|publisher=[[Kyiv Post]]|date=5 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406141250/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/125579/|archivedate=6 April 2012}}</ref>

===Early leadership===
{{Further|Hetman of Zaporizhian Host|Hetman of Ukraine}}
Prior to the formation of the modern Ukrainian presidency, the previous Ukrainian head of state office was officially established in exile by [[Andriy Livytskyi]]. At first the de facto leader of nation was the president of the [[Central Rada]] at early years of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], while the highest governing body was the [[General Secretariat of Ukraine|General Secretariat]] headed by its chairman. With the proclamation of the last [[Universal (act)|universal]] of the UPR dated 25 January 1918 due to a military aggression, the [[Tsentralna Rada|Central Rada]] (council) of the UPR proclaimed its independence from the [[Russian Democratic Federative Republic|Russia]]. On 29 April 1918, the Rada elected [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]] as the first president of the Central Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\H\R\HrushevskyMykhailo.htm|title=Hrushevsky, Mykhailo|author=Ohloblyn, Oleksander and Lubomyr Wynar|accessdate=24 December 2008|work=[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605000438/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CH%5CR%5CHrushevskyMykhailo.htm|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in effect making him the ''de facto'' leader of the republic. Although a rather widespread misconception, the state leadership position title varied and none of them had an official "presidential" title.

On 29 April 1918 the Central Rada was arrested and liquidated during a coup d'état initiated by the local German administration to install [[Hetman]] [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] who barely spoke a word of the [[Ukrainian language]]. In November of the same year the [[Directorate of Ukraine|directorate]] government of the UPR was established as the opposition movement to the Skoropadsky's regime. The Ukrainian People's Republic was soon re-established in December 1918 with [[Volodymyr Vynnychenko]] as the Directorate's chairman, serving as the republic's ''de facto'' second "president" from 19 December 1918 to 10 February 1919.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article?art_id=1305424&cat_id=1290586|title=Vynnychenko Volodymyr Kyrylovych|accessdate=15 December 2008|work=Government portal|publisher=[[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930061919/http://www.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article?art_id=1305424&cat_id=1290586|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Although really the Directorate was the temporary governing body until the new Ukrainian Constituent Assembly would elect its president. [[Symon Petliura]] assumed the representation of the state after Vynnychenko's resignation on 11 February 1919 and until Petlyura's assassination in Paris on 25 May 1926.

===In exile===
{{Main|President of Ukraine (in exile)}}

After the [[Ukrainian War of Independence|Soviet offensive]] in 1920 and brought control of the Ukrainian territory under the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic]], the Ukrainian People's Republic was forced into exile. Upon the assassination of Petliura, the control over the state affairs were transferred to the former Prime Minister [[Andriy Livytskyi]] who in 1948 created the office of the president of Ukraine. Livytskyi served as the first president (in exile) until January 1954. [[Stepan Vytvytskyi]] served after Livytskyi from January 1954 until his death on 9 October 1965. Following Vytvytskyi's death, Ivan Bahrianyi temporarily carried out the presidential authority until the third president-in-exile [[Mykola Livytskyi]] (son of the first president-in-exile) was sworn into office.<ref name="ukrmoloda">{{cite news|first=Mykhailo|last=Rol|title=Tenth President|url=http://www.umoloda.kiev.ua/number/352/264/12716/|publisher=Ukrayina Moloda|accessdate=30 December 2008|language=Ukrainian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521215134/http://www.umoloda.kiev.ua/number/352/264/12716/|archivedate=21 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Livytskyi served from 1967 until his death in December 1989.

[[Mykola Plaviuk]] was the last president-in-exile (and the fourth), serving from December 1989 until his resignation on 22 August 1992 when he ceremonially gave in his presidential authority and state symbols to the newly elected Ukrainian president [[Leonid Kravchuk]] at his inauguration ceremony.<ref name="ukr">{{cite web|url=http://presscenter.ukrinform.ua/vip_gallery.php?photo_id=143|script-title=uk:Плав'юк Микола Васильович|trans-title=Mykola Vasyliovych Plaviuk|accessdate=18 December 2008|work=presscenter.ukrinform.ua|language=uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024023647/http://presscenter.ukrinform.ua/vip_gallery.php?photo_id=143|archivedate=24 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uvkr.com.ua/ua/visnyk/uvkr-2002/august/gr-ukr.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727114824/http://www.uvkr.com.ua/ua/visnyk/uvkr-2002/august/gr-ukr.html|archivedate=27 July 2011|title=10 years since the Government center of the UPR in exile gave to the free and sovereign Ukraine the symbols of government authority.

[[Viktor Yanukovych]] has claimed to be the legitimate president of Ukraine stating that the events of the [[2014 Ukrainian Revolution]] amounted to a coup and that the impeachment process has not been properly carried out. On 3 October 2014, a Ukrainian official said that Viktor Yanukovych and other former top officials have obtained Russian citizenship in a "secret decree" signed by Vladimir Putin. If this actually turned out to be true, it would suggest that Yanukovich had given up his claims for presidency as Ukrainian law does not allow for dual citizenship.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/yanukovych-herashchenko-russian-citizneship-pshonka-azarov/26618831.html|title=Kyiv Says Yanukovych Obtained Russian Citizenship|publisher=Radio Free Europe|date=3 October 2014|accessdate=3 October 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003115719/http://www.rferl.org/content/yanukovych-herashchenko-russian-citizneship-pshonka-azarov/26618831.html|archivedate=3 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, this would not negate the claim that the change of government in March 2014 was a political ''coup d'état''.

===Modern presidency===
The modern Ukrainian presidency was established on 5 July 1991 by the [[Verkhovna Rada#History|Verkhovna Rada]] of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], which formed the office of "president of the Ukrainian SSR" ({{lang-uk|Президент Української РСР}}).<ref>{{Cite Ukrainian law|type=[[Verkhovna Rada|Verkhovna Rada of the UkSSR]] decree|number=1295-XII|law=1295-12|name=On the President of the Ukrainian SSR|date=5 July 1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.ua/en/content/president_history.html|title=The History of Presidency|accessdate=24 December 2008|work=[[Secretariat of the President of Ukraine|Presidential Administration of Ukraine]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302005021/http://www.president.gov.ua/en/content/president_history.html|archivedate=2 March 2008}}</ref> During the transitional period until the [[1991 Ukrainian presidential election|presidential elections]], the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (then held by Leonid Kravchuk) was empowered with a presidential authority. With the proclamation of Ukrainian independence from the [[Soviet Union]], the office's official title was changed to "President of Ukraine" on 24 August. In the current Constitution, the Ukrainian presidency is defined in [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Chapter V: President of Ukraine|Chapter V]], Articles 102–112.

[[File:RIAN archive 41059 CIS heads of state.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The first Ukrainian president [[Leonid Kravchuk]] (left) along with other heads of states of the newly formed [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] in 1991.]]

So far, five presidential elections have been conducted. The [[1991 Ukrainian presidential election|first election]] in 1991 was held at the same time as Ukrainians voted to support the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Declaration of Independence]] in the [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|independence referendum]]. [[Leonid Kravchuk]] was elected Ukraine's first president on 1 December 1991. He was elected by a record number of voters with over 19.5&nbsp;million who wanted him to see as the leader of the state. That number has not been beaten yet. His major opponents were the leader of [[People's Movement of Ukraine|Rukh]] [[Vyacheslav Chornovil]] and the author of the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Declaration of Independence]]. President Kravchuk remained in office until he resigned as part of a political compromise. A [[snap election]] was held in [[1994 Ukrainian presidential election|1994]], which was won by Ukraine's former Prime Minister [[Leonid Kuchma]]. Kuchma was re-elected for a second term of office in [[1999 Ukrainian presidential election|1999]].

The [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|2004]] presidential election was marked by controversy with allegations of electoral fraud in the conduct of the second round [[Two-round system|runoff]] ballot between opposition candidate [[Viktor Yushchenko]] and the government-backed candidate and former Prime Minister [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. After mass nationwide protests, colloquially known as the "[[Orange Revolution]]," a new election was held on 26 December 2004 in which Victor Yushchenko was declared the winner with 52% of the vote and was subsequently sworn into office on 23 January 2005.  Victor Yanukovych again served as Prime Minister.

The [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election|2010 election]] took place on 17 January, with a run-off on 7 February due to a 13 May Constitutional Court ruling striking down 25 October date that the parliament called in April 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=Court declares unconstitutional parliament's resolution calling presidential polls for October 25, 2009|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/13747.html|work=[[Interfax-Ukraine]]|date=13 May 2009|accessdate=13 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224041337/http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/13747.html|archivedate=24 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result of this election [[Viktor Yanukovych]] was elected the fourth modern president of Ukraine.

After Viktor Yanukovych was removed from power in early 2014 as a result of the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] the chairman of parliament [[Oleksandr Turchynov]] was appointed to the role of acting president by the [[Verkhovna Rada]] in accordance with article 112 of the Constitution of Ukraine. Oleksandr Turchynov served as the acting president from 23 February until 7 June 2014 and was the only person in Ukrainian history to serve in the role. The acting president of Ukraine lacks many of the executive powers of a president and is only meant to serve for a short time before a new election can take place. During his tenure Oleksandr Turchynov was addressed as "acting president" by other Ukrainian politicians and the media.

On 18 June 2015 Yanukovych was officially deprived of the title of President of Ukraine.<ref name=yanunopres/>

The [[2019 Ukrainian presidential election|2019 election]] took place on 31 March, with a run-off on 21 April. As a result of this election, [[Volodymyr Zelensky]], a former actor and comedian with no prior political experience has become the sixth President of Ukraine, scoring a record 73.22% of the popular vote in the run-off against the incumbent Petro Poroshenko.

The [[Government of Ukraine]] is based on a [[semi presidential system]]. The president of Ukraine is the head of [[Nation state|state]] while the prime minister is the [[head of government]] with the current prime minister being [[Denys Shmyhal]]. Ukraine is somewhat unusual in that while many countries use a similar system typically the role of one leader is relegated to being ceremonial, in Ukraine however both the prime minister and the president have great power and responsibility assigned to their roles. Because the president of Ukraine must approve the appointment of the prime minister the post of president is generally thought of as the more powerful role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/up.html|publisher=CIA World Factbook|title=Ukraine|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129121705/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/up.html|archivedate=29 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Buildings===
The [[Presidential Administration of Ukraine]] is an administrative body set up to provide analytical, advisory and legal assistance to the president. It is colloquially known as "Bankova", because it is located on [[Bankova Street]] in a massive [[Presidential Administration Building (Kiev)|building]] across from the House with Chimaeras. The head of the administration, the Chief Secretary, acts as the [[gray cardinal]] for the president in Ukrainian politics. Around fourteen state residences are allocated for official presidential use, many of which remain from the Kuchma-era presidency.<ref>{{cite news|title=Korrespondent: Yushchenko has more residences than his European colleagues|url=http://ua.korrespondent.net/ukraine/770969|publisher=[[Korrespondent]]|date=13 March 2009|accessdate=24 March 2009|language=Ukrainian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103042/http://ua.korrespondent.net/ukraine/770969|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The official ceremonial residence is the [[Mariyinsky Palace]] in Kyiv. Other state residences include the [[House with Chimaeras]] and the [[House of the Weeping Widow]] in Kyiv, the [[Yusupov Palace (Crimea)|Yusupov Palace]] in [[Crimea]] and Synehora in [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast]]. In addition, each former president has been allotted a state-owned [[dacha]] in the former forest preserve in [[Koncha-Zaspa]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Svitlana Tuchynska|title=Ukrayinska Pravda exposes president's Mezhygirya deal|publisher=[[Kyiv Post]]|date=6 May 2009|accessdate=22 March 2011|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/66006/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204193551/https://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/66006/|archivedate=4 February 2011}}</ref>

A lot of additional material-technical, social-communal, health care provision support is offered by the [[State Management of Affairs (Ukraine)|State Department of Affairs]] (abbreviated as DUS) that is created for state officials and subordinated to the president of Ukraine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zakon5.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/474/2000|title=Presidential Decree No. 474/2000|language=uk|work=Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine|date=22 October 2011|accessdate=26 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204073234/http://zakon5.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/474/2000|archivedate=4 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> DUS is a supporting state agency that was restructured in 2000 out of the Presidential Directory of Affairs. Primarily the agency is designated for the president and its administration, while also provides support for the Cabinet of Ministers, parliament, and other state agencies if budget permits.

===Official symbols===
The president's official state symbols consists of the [[Flag of the President of Ukraine|Presidential Standard]] of the Ukrainian Flag, the [[Seal of the President of Ukraine]], the Presidential ID Card, the [[Collar of the President of Ukraine|Presidential Collar]], and the [[Bulava of the President of Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.ua/en/content/president_national_symbols.html|title=Official Symbols of the President of Ukraine|accessdate=25 December 2008|work=[[Secretariat of the President of Ukraine|Presidential Administration of Ukraine]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012095655/http://www.president.gov.ua/en/content/president_national_symbols.html|archivedate=12 October 2008}}</ref> The presidential symbols, along with other important presidential documents and media, are contained in the [[Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine]], the country's main [[academic library]].

===Family===
{{see also|First Lady of Ukraine}}
The president's spouse is recognized as the First Lady, much in the similar fashion as in other countries, although such a title holds no official and legal responsibility and is often undisclosed. However, during the Yushchenko Presidency, his marriage to [[Kateryna Yushchenko]] and their private life drew a lot of attention from the media. Apart from Kateryna Yushchenko, little else is known about the other presidential spouses.

The tradition of the Ukrainian "First family" was established by [[Kuchma]], who became the in-law to his daughter's husband and politician [[Viktor Pinchuk]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} During the presidency of [[Viktor Yanukovych]], the "first family" meaning was taken to the next level whose son Viktor became a parliamentarian of [[Verkhovna Rada]] with the same [[Party of Regions|political party]] affiliation.

==Presidential awards==
The distinction of "Honorary Weapon" is awarded by the president. The specific weapon is a 9-mm caliber [[RPC Fort|Fort-21.02]] [[pistol]] with 16 bullets. The body pistol is made of structural steel, with the handle is made of noble wood. The name of the awardee is engraved on the plate. This distinction was established in 1995 under the President [[Leonid Kuchma]], who himself has awarded the most pistols, numbering at 85. From 1995-2018, the Presidents have issued honorary weapons to 152 persons. Since 2019, no one has been awarded an honorary weapon.<ref>https://ukranews.com/en/amp/news/725315-poroshenko-and-zelenskyy-for-first-time-since-1995-did-not-award-anyone-with-honorary-weapon-in</ref>
