{{About||theories in science|scientific theory|other uses}}

A '''theory''' is a [[contemplation|contemplative]] and [[reason|rational]] type of [[abstraction|abstract]] or generalizing thinking about a [[phenomenon]], or the results of such thinking. The process of contemplative and rational thinking often is associated with such processes like [[observational study]], [[research]]. Theories may either be [[scientific theory|scientific]] or other than scientific (or scientific to less extent). Depending on the context, the results might, for example, include generalized explanations of how [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] works. The word has its roots in [[ancient Greek]], but in modern use it has taken on several related meanings.

In modern [[science]], the term "theory" refers to [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], a well-confirmed type of explanation of [[nature]], made in a way [[Consistency|consistent]] with [[scientific method]], and fulfilling the [[Scientific theory#Characteristics of theories|criteria]] required by [[modern science]]. Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] support for it, or empirical contradiction ("[[Falsifiability|falsify]]") of it. Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge,<ref>{{cite web |last=Schafersman |first=Steven D. |title=An Introduction to Science |url = http://www.geo.sunysb.edu/esp/files/scientific-method.html }}</ref> in contrast to more common uses of the word "theory" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word ''[[hypothesis]]'').<ref>{{cite book| author=National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine| title=Science, evolution, and creationism| date=2008| publisher=National Academies Press| location=Washington, D.C.| isbn=978-0309105866| page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780309105866/page/11 11]| url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780309105866/page/11| accessdate=26 September 2015| url-access=registration}}</ref> Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically [[testable]] [[conjecture]]s, and from [[scientific laws]], which are descriptive accounts of the way nature behaves under certain conditions.

The word theory or "in theory" is sometimes used erroneously by people to explain something which they individually did not experience or test before.<ref>[https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/darwin/evolution-today/what-is-a-theory What is a Theory?]. [[American Museum of Natural History]].</ref> In those instances, semantically, it is being substituted for another [[concept]], a [[hypothesis]]. Instead of using the word "hypothetically", it is replaced by a phrase: "in theory". In some instances the theory's credibility could be contested by calling it "just a theory" (implying that the idea has not even been tested).<ref name=mediumthelaw/> Hence, that word "theory" is very often contrasted to "[[praxis (process)|practice]]" (from Greek ''[[Wiktionary:praxis|praxis]]'', πρᾶξις) a Greek term for ''doing'', which is opposed to theory.<ref name=mediumthelaw>David J Pfeiffer.

[[Science Journal]] (on medium.com). 30 January 2017</ref> A "classical example" of the distinction between "theoretical" and "practical" uses the discipline of medicine: [[medical theory]] involves trying to understand the [[Causality|causes]] and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy.

== Ancient usage ==
The English word ''theory'' derives from a technical term in [[philosophy]] in [[Classical Greece|Ancient Greek]]. As an everyday word, ''[[theoria]]'', {{lang|grc|θεωρία}}, meant "looking at, viewing, beholding", but in more technical contexts it came to refer to [[contemplation|contemplative]] or [[speculative reason|speculative]] understandings of [[nature (philosophy)|natural things]], such as those of [[natural philosopher]]s, as opposed to more practical ways of knowing things, like that of skilled orators or artisans.{{efn|1=The word ''theoria'' occurs in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]], for example, that of [[Plato]]. It is a statement of how and why particular facts are related. It is related to words for {{lang|grc|θεωρός}} "spectator", {{lang|grc|θέα}} ''thea'' "a view" + {{lang|grc|ὁρᾶν}} ''horan'' "to see", literally "looking at a show". See for example [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&lookup=qewr&lang=greek dictionary entries at Perseus website].}} English-speakers have used the word ''theory'' since at least the late [[16th century]].<ref>{{OEtymD|theory|accessdate=2008-07-18}}</ref> Modern uses of the word ''theory'' derive from the original definition, but have taken on new shades of meaning, still based on the idea of a theory as a thoughtful and [[reason|rational]] explanation of the general [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] of things.

Although it has more mundane meanings in Greek, the word {{lang|grc|θεωρία}} apparently developed special uses early in the recorded history of the [[Greek language]]. In the book ''From Religion to Philosophy'', [[F. M. Cornford|Francis Cornford]] suggests that the [[Orphics]] used the word ''theoria'' to mean "passionate sympathetic contemplation".<ref>{{cite book |title=From religion to philosophy: a study in the origins of western speculation |url=https://archive.org/details/fromreligiontoph0000corn |url-access=registration |last=Cornford |first=Francis Macdonald |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=November 8, 1991 |isbn=978-0-691-02076-1}}</ref> [[Pythagoras]] changed the word to mean a passionate sympathetic contemplation of mathematical knowledge, because he considered this intellectual pursuit the way to reach the highest plane of existence. Pythagoras emphasized subduing emotions and bodily desires to help the intellect function at the higher plane of theory. Thus, it was Pythagoras who gave the word ''theory'' the specific meaning that led to the classical and modern concept of a distinction between theory (as uninvolved, neutral thinking) and practice.<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Bertrand Russell |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=History of Western Philosophy |year=1945|title-link=History of Western Philosophy (Russell) }}</ref>

Aristotle's terminology, as already mentioned, contrasts theory with ''praxis'' or practice, and this contrast exists till today. For Aristotle, both practice and theory involve thinking, but the aims are different. Theoretical contemplation considers things humans do not move or change, such as [[nature (philosophy)|nature]], so it has no human aim apart from itself and the knowledge it helps create. On the other hand, ''praxis'' involves thinking, but always with an aim to desired actions, whereby humans cause change or movement themselves for their own ends. Any human movement that involves no conscious choice and thinking could not be an example of ''praxis'' or doing.{{efn|1= 
The [[A Greek–English Lexicon|LSJ]] cites two passages of Aristotle as examples, both from the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' and involving the definition of [[natural science]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D11%3Asection%3D1064a 11.1064a17], "it is clear that natural science (φυσικὴν ἐπιστήμην) must be neither practical (πρακτικὴν) nor productive (ποιητικὴν), but speculative (θεωρητικὴν)" and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D1025b 6.1025b25], "Thus if every intellectual activity [διάνοια] is either practical or productive or speculative (θεωρητική), physics (φυσικὴ) will be a speculative [θεωρητική] science." So Aristotle actually made a three way distinction between practical, theoretical and productive or technical—or between doing, contemplating or making. All three types involve thinking, but are distinguished by what causes the objects of thought to move or change.}}

==Formality==
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}
Theories are [[analysis|analytical]] tools for [[understanding]], [[explanation|explaining]], and making [[prediction]]s about a given subject matter. There are theories in many and varied fields of study, including the [[art]]s and [[science]]s. A formal theory is [[syntax (logic)|syntactic]] in nature and is only meaningful when given a [[semantics|semantic]] component by applying it to some content (e.g., [[fact]]s and relationships of the actual historical world as it is unfolding). Theories in various fields of study are expressed in [[natural language]], but are always constructed in such a way that their general form is identical to a theory as it is expressed in the [[formal language]] of [[mathematical logic]]. Theories may be expressed mathematically, symbolically, or in common language, but are generally expected to follow principles of [[reason|rational thought]] or [[logic]].

Theory is constructed of a set of [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] that are entirely true statements about the subject under consideration. However, the truth of any one of these statements is always relative to the whole theory. Therefore, the same statement may be true with respect to one theory, and not true with respect to another. This is, in ordinary language, where statements such as "He is a terrible person" cannot be judged as true or false without reference to some [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of who "He" is and for that matter what a "terrible person" is under the theory.<ref name="curry">Curry, Haskell, ''Foundations of Mathematical Logic''</ref>

Sometimes two theories have exactly the same [[explanatory power]] because they make the same predictions. A pair of such theories is called indistinguishable or [[observational equivalence|observationally equivalent]], and the choice between them reduces to convenience or philosophical preference.

The [[metatheory|form of theories]] is studied formally in mathematical logic, especially in [[model theory]]. When theories are studied in mathematics, they are usually expressed in some formal language and their statements are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under application of certain procedures called [[rules of inference]]. A special case of this, an axiomatic theory, consists of [[axioms]] (or axiom schemata) and rules of inference. A [[theorem]] is a statement that can be derived from those axioms by application of these rules of inference. Theories used in applications are [[abstraction]]s of observed phenomena and the resulting theorems provide solutions to real-world problems. Obvious examples include [[arithmetic]] (abstracting concepts of number), [[geometry]] (concepts of space), and [[probability]] (concepts of randomness and likelihood).

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] shows that no consistent, [[recursively enumerable]] theory (that is, one whose theorems form a recursively enumerable set) in which the concept of [[natural numbers]] can be expressed, can include all [[truth|true]] statements about them. As a result, some domains of knowledge cannot be formalized, accurately and completely, as mathematical theories. (Here, formalizing accurately and completely means that all true propositions—and only true propositions—are derivable within the mathematical system.) This limitation, however, in no way precludes the construction of mathematical theories that formalize large bodies of scientific knowledge.

===Underdetermination===
{{Main|Underdetermination}}
A theory is ''underdetermined'' (also called ''indeterminacy of data to theory'') if a rival, inconsistent theory is at least as consistent with the evidence. Underdetermination is an [[epistemology|epistemological]] issue about the relation of [[evidence]] to conclusions.

A theory that lacks supporting evidence is generally, more properly, referred to as a [[hypothesis]].

===Intertheoretic reduction and elimination===
{{Main|Intertheoretic reduction}}
If a new theory better explains and predicts a phenomenon than an old theory (i.e., it has more [[explanatory power]]), we are [[Theory of justification|justified]] in believing that the newer theory describes reality more correctly. This is called an ''intertheoretic reduction'' because the terms of the old theory can be reduced to the terms of the new one. For instance, our historical understanding about ''sound'', "light" and ''heat'' have been reduced to ''wave compressions and rarefactions'', ''electromagnetic waves'', and ''molecular kinetic energy'', respectively. These terms, which are identified with each other, are called ''intertheoretic identities.'' When an old and new theory are parallel in this way, we can conclude that the new one describes the same reality, only more completely.

When a new theory uses new terms that do not reduce to terms of an older theory, but rather replace them because they misrepresent reality, it is called an ''intertheoretic elimination.'' For instance, the [[superseded scientific theories|obsolete scientific theory]] that put forward an understanding of heat transfer in terms of the movement of [[caloric fluid]] was eliminated when a theory of heat as energy replaced it. Also, the theory that [[phlogiston]] is a substance released from burning and rusting material was eliminated with the new understanding of the reactivity of oxygen.

===Versus theorems===
Theories are distinct from [[theorem]]s. A ''theorem'' is [[formal proof|derived]] deductively from [[axiom]]s (basic assumptions) according to a [[formal system]] of rules, sometimes as an end in itself and sometimes as a first step toward being tested or applied in a concrete situation; theorems are said to be true in the sense that the conclusions of a theorem are logical consequences of the axioms. ''Theories'' are abstract and conceptual, and are supported or challenged by observations in the world. They are '[[rigor]]ously tentative', meaning that they are proposed as true and expected to satisfy careful examination to account for the possibility of faulty inference or incorrect observation. Sometimes theories are incorrect, meaning that an explicit set of observations contradicts some fundamental objection or application of the theory, but more often theories are corrected to conform to new observations, by restricting the class of phenomena the theory applies to or changing the assertions made. An example of the former is the restriction of classical mechanics to phenomena involving macroscopic length scales and particle speeds much lower than the speed of light.

==Scientific==
{{Main|Scientific theory}}
In science, the term "theory" refers to "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been [[Reproducibility|repeatedly confirmed]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]."<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&page=2 National Academy of Sciences], 1999</ref><ref name="AAAS Evolution Resources">[http://www.aaas.org/news/press_room/evolution/qanda.shtml AAAS Evolution Resources]</ref> Theories must also meet further requirements, such as the ability to make [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] predictions with consistent accuracy across a broad area of scientific inquiry, and production of strong evidence in favor of the theory from multiple independent sources ([[consilience]]).

The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain, which is measured by its ability to make [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] [[Prediction#Prediction in science|predictions]] with respect to those phenomena. Theories are improved (or replaced by better theories) as more evidence is gathered, so that accuracy in prediction improves over time; this increased accuracy corresponds to an increase in scientific knowledge. Scientists use theories as a foundation to gain further scientific knowledge, as well as to accomplish goals such as inventing [[technology]] or curing [[diseases]].

===Definitions from scientific organizations===
The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] defines scientific theories as follows:<blockquote>The formal scientific definition of "theory" is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence. Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics) ... One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed.<ref>{{wete web |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&page=11 |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |year=2008 |title=Science, Evolution, and Creationism}}</ref></blockquote>

From the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]:
<blockquote>A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than "just a theory." It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.<ref name="AAAS Evolution Resources"/></blockquote>

The term ''theory'' is not appropriate for describing [[Scientific modelling|scientific models]] or untested, but intricate hypotheses.

=== Philosophical views===
The [[logical positivist]]s thought of scientific theories as ''deductive theories''—that a theory's content is based on some [[formal system|formal system of logic]] and on basic [[axioms]]. In a deductive theory, any sentence which is a [[logical consequence]] of one or more of the axioms is also a sentence of that theory.<ref name="curry"/> This is called the [[received view of theories]].

In the [[semantic view of theories]],  which has largely replaced the received view,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Suppe |first1=Frederick |year=1998 |title=Understanding Scientific Theories: An Assessment of Developments, 1969-1998 |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=67 |pages=S102–S115 |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/Suppe_2000.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013 |doi=10.1086/392812|s2cid=37361274 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Halvorson |first1=Hans |year=2012 |title=What Scientific Theories Could Not Be |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=183–206 |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/halvorson2012.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013 |doi=10.1086/664745|citeseerx=10.1.1.692.8455 |s2cid=37897853 }}</ref> theories are viewed as [[scientific models]]. A [[Scientific model|model]] is a logical framework intended to represent reality (a "model of reality"), similar to the way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or country. In this approach, theories are a specific category of models that fulfill the necessary criteria. (See [[Scientific theory#Theories as models|Theories as models]] for further discussion.)

===In physics===
In [[physics]] the term ''theory'' is generally used for a mathematical framework—derived from a small set of basic [[postulates]] (usually symmetries, like equality of locations in space or in time, or identity of electrons, etc.)—which is capable of producing experimental predictions for a given category of physical systems. One good example is [[classical electromagnetism]], which encompasses results derived from [[gauge symmetry]] (sometimes called gauge invariance) in a form of a few equations called [[Maxwell's equations]]. The specific mathematical aspects of classical electromagnetic theory are termed "laws of electromagnetism", reflecting the level of consistent and reproducible evidence that supports them. Within electromagnetic theory generally, there are numerous hypotheses about how electromagnetism applies to specific situations. Many of these hypotheses are already considered adequately tested, with new ones always in the making and perhaps untested.

=== Regarding the term ''theoretical'' ===
Acceptance of a theory does not require that all of its major predictions be tested{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, if it is already supported by sufficiently strong evidence. For example, certain tests may be infeasible or technically difficult. As a result, theories may make predictions that have not yet been confirmed or proven incorrect; in this case, the predicted results may be described informally using the term "theoretical." These predictions can be tested at a later time, and if they are incorrect, this may lead to revision, invalidation, or rejection of the theory.

== Mathematical ==
In [[mathematics]] the use of the term ''theory'' is different, necessarily so, since mathematics contains no explanations of natural phenomena, ''per se'', even though it may help provide insight into natural systems or be inspired by them. In the general sense, a mathematical ''theory'' is a branch of or topic in mathematics, such as [[Set theory]], [[Number theory]], [[Group theory]], [[Probability theory]], [[Game theory]], [[Control theory]], [[Perturbation theory]], etc., such as might be appropriate for a single textbook.

In the same sense, but more specifically, the word ''theory'' is an extensive, structured collection of theorems, organized so that the proof of each theorem only requires the theorems and axioms that preceded it (no circular proofs), occurs as early as feasible in sequence (no postponed proofs), and the whole is as succinct as possible (no redundant proofs).{{efn|''Succinct'' in this sense refers to the whole collection of proofs, and means that any one proof contains no embedded stages that are equivalent to parts of proofs of later theorems.}} Ideally, the sequence in which the theorems are presented is as easy to understand as possible, although illuminating a branch of mathematics is the purpose of textbooks, rather than the mathematical theory they might be written to cover.

== Philosophical==
{{Main|Philosophical theory}}
A theory can be either ''descriptive'' as in science, or ''prescriptive'' ([[normative ethics|normative]]) as in philosophy.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kneller |first1=George Frederick |title=Introduction to the philosophy of education |date=1964 |publisher=J. Wiley|location=New York |page=93 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OQhAAAAMAAJ&q=editions:UOM39015026974538 |language=en}}</ref> The latter are those whose subject matter consists not of empirical data, but rather of [[idea]]s. At least some of the elementary theorems of a philosophical theory are statements whose truth cannot necessarily be scientifically tested through [[empiricism|empirical observation]].

A field of study is sometimes named a "theory" because its basis is some initial set of assumptions describing the field's approach to the subject. These assumptions are the elementary theorems of the particular theory, and can be thought of as the axioms of that field. Some commonly known examples include [[set theory]] and [[number theory]]; however [[literary theory]], [[critical theory]], and [[music theory]] are also of the same form.

=== Metatheory ===
{{Main|Metatheory}}
One form of philosophical theory is a ''metatheory'' or ''meta-theory''. A metatheory is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory or set of theories. In other words, it is a theory about theories. [[Statement (logic)|Statements]] made in the metatheory about the theory are called [[metatheorem]]s.

== Political==
{{Main|Political theory}}
A political theory is an [[ethics|ethical]] theory about the law and government. Often the term "political theory" refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about [[politics]].

== Jurisprudential ==
{{Main|Jurisprudence|Law}}
In social science, [[jurisprudence]] is the philosophical theory of law. Contemporary philosophy of law addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution.
