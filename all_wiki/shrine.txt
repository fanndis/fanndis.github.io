A '''shrine''' ({{lang-la|scrinium}} "case or chest for books or papers"; [[Old French]]: ''escrin'' "box or case")<ref>{{OEtymD|shrine}}</ref> is a holy or '''sacred site''' dedicated to a specific [[deity]], [[ancestor worship|ancestor]], [[hero]], [[martyr]], [[saint]], [[Daemon (mythology)|daemon]], or similar figure of respect, wherein they are [[veneration|venerated]] or [[worship]]ped. Shrines often contain [[Cult image|idol]]s, [[relic]]s, or other such objects associated with the figure being venerated.<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/shrine Shrine]. thefreedictionary.com</ref> A shrine at which [[votive offering]]s are made is called an [[altar]].

Shrines are found in many of the world's religions, including [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Chinese folk religion]], [[Shinto]], [[indigenous Philippine folk religions]], and [[Germanic paganism|Asatru]] as well as in secular and non-religious settings such as a war memorial. Shrines can be found in various settings, such as [[Church (building)|churches]], [[temple]]s, [[cemetery|cemeteries]], [[Conservation of South Asian household shrines|museums]], or in the home. Although, [[portable shrine]]s are also found in some cultures.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/p/portable_shrine.aspx Portable Tibetan Shrine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019023015/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/p/portable_shrine.aspx |date=2015-10-19 }}.

==Types of shrines==
[[File:Bankfield Museum 024.jpg|thumb|150px|[[China|Chinese]] [[Taoism|Taoist]] household shrine 1850–1860, [[Bankfield Museum]]]]

===Temple shrines===
Many shrines are located within buildings and in the temples designed specifically for worship, such as a [[Church architecture|church]] in [[Christianity]], or a [[Hindu temple|mandir]] in Hinduism. A shrine here is usually the center of attention in the building and is given a place of prominence. In such cases, adherents of the faith assemble within the building in order to venerate the deity at the shrine. In classical temple architecture, the shrine may be synonymous with the [[cella]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

===Household shrines===
Historically, in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]], and also in modern faiths, such as [[Neopaganism]], a shrine can commonly be found within the home or shop.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_198/buddhistshrines.html |title=Shrines in shops in Chinatown|volume =19 |issue =41 |date= February 23, 2007|author=Patricia Chang |journal=Downtown Express}}</ref> This shrine is usually a small structure or a setup of pictures and figurines dedicated to a deity that is part of the official religion, to [[ancestor worship|ancestors]] or to a localised [[household deity]].<ref>[http://www.gualalaarts.org/Exhibits/Gallery/2009-10HouseholdShrines.html Household Shrines]. Gualala Arts</ref>

===Yard shrines===
Small outdoor yard shrines are found at the bottom of many peoples' gardens, following various religions, including historically, [[Idolatry in Christianity|Christianity]]. Many consist of a statue of [[Christ]], [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] or a [[saint]], on a pedestal or in an alcove, while others may be elaborate booths without ceilings, some include paintings, statuary, and architectural elements, such as walls, roofs, glass doors and ironwork fences.{{Citation needed|date= October 2019}}

In the United States, some Christians have small yard shrines; some of these resemble side altars, since they are composed of a statue placed in a niche or [[grotto]]; this type is colloquially referred to as a ''[[bathtub madonna]]''.<ref>[http://www.catholichomeandgarden.com/front_yard_shrines.htm Front Yard Shrines] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327112508/http://www.catholichomeandgarden.com/front_yard_shrines.htm |date=2009-03-27 }}. catholichomeandgarden.com</ref>

Shrines are found in many religions. As distinguished from a [[temple]], a shrine usually houses a particular [[relic]] or [[cult image]], which is the object of [[worship]] or [[veneration]]. A shrine may also be constructed to set apart a site which is thought to be particularly holy, as opposed to being placed for the convenience of worshipers. Shrines therefore attract the practice of [[pilgrimage]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100726150033/http://www.sacred-destinations.com/sacred-sites/catholic-shrines.htm Catholic Shrines].

===Christianity===
Shrines are found in many, though not all, forms of [[Christianity]]. [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], the largest denomination of Christianity,<ref>[[Roman Catholic Church|Wikipedia Roman Catholic Church]]</ref> has many shrines, as do [[Orthodox Christianity]], [[Anglicanism]] and some forms of [[Lutheranism]].

[[File:Bac.Catherine.Cercueil.jpg|thumb|Catholic shrine: glass coffin of [[Catherine Labouré|Saint Catherine Labouré]]]]
In the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[1983 Code of Canon Law]], canons 1230 and 1231 read: "The term shrine means a church or other sacred place which, with the approval of the local [[Ordinary (Catholic Church)|Ordinary]], is by reason of special [[Catholic devotions|devotion]] frequented by the faithful as [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]]. For a [[National Shrine|shrine to be described as national]], the approval of the [[Episcopal Conference]] is necessary. For it to be described as international, the approval of the [[Holy See]] is required."<ref>[http://www.ourladyswarriors.org/canon/c1205-1253.htm PART III : SACRED PLACES AND TIMES]. ourladyswarriors.org</ref>

[[File:Vadstena klosterkyrka, den 24 juni 2008, bild 5.jpg|thumb|[[Church of Sweden]] reliquary shrine of Saint [[Bridget of Sweden]] in [[Vadstena]]]]
Another use of the term "shrine" in colloquial Catholic terminology is a niche or alcove in most – especially larger – churches used by parishioners when praying privately in the church. They were also called [[Altar|devotional altar]]s, since they could look like small [[side altar]]s or bye-altars. Shrines were always centered on some image of Christ, [[Virgin Mary|Mary]] or a saint – for instance, a statue, painting, mural or mosaic, and may have had a [[reredos]] behind them (without a [[Church tabernacle|Tabernacle]] built in).{{Citation needed|date= October 2019}}

However, [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] would not be celebrated at them; they were simply used to aid or give a visual focus for prayers. Side altars, where Mass could actually be celebrated, were used in a similar way to shrines by parishioners. Side altars were specifically dedicated to [[Blessed Virgin Mary|The Virgin Mary]], [[Saint Joseph]] as well as other saints.{{Citation needed|date= October 2019}}

A [[Nativity scene|nativity set]] could also be viewed as a shrine, as the definition of a shrine is any holy or sacred place.{{Citation needed|date= October 2019}}

Important things about graves are remarked on in a chapter entitled “About the Condemnation of One Who Worships Allah at the Grave of a Righteous Man, and What if He Worships [the Dead] Himself.”72 Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab starts by quoting a hadith: “Umm Salama told the messenger of Allah about a church she had seen in Abyssinia in which there were pictures. The Prophet said: ‘Those people, when a righteous member of their community or a pious slave dies, they build a mosque over his grave and paint images thereon; they are for God wicked people.’ They combine two kinds of ''fitna'': the ''fitna'' of graves and the ''fitna'' of images.” He then continues with another hadith: “When the messenger of Allah was close to death, he . . . said: ‘May Allah curse the Jews and Christians who make the graves of their prophets into places of worship; do not imitate them.’” From this hadith Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab derives the prohibition of building places of worship over graves, because that would mean glorification of their inhabitants, which would amount to an act of worship to other than Allah.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810233401/https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/cp/CP2.pdf|archive-date=10 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, he commanded leveling of the graves (''taswiyat al-qubur''), which the scholar [[Al-Shafi‘i|Imam Al-Shafi'i]] supported.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/cp/CP2.pdf|title=From Visiting Graves to Their Destruction: The Question of Ziyara through the Eyes of Salafis|last1=Ondrej|first1=Beranek|last2=Tupek|first2=Pavel|date=July 2009|publisher=Brandeis University.

The Wahhabi movement was heavily influenced by the works of the medieval [[Hanbali]] theologian [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] who was considered by them to be the "ultimate authority on a great number of issues".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Hanbali and Wahhabi Schools of Thought As Observed Through the Case of Ziyārah|last=Zargar|first=Cameron|publisher=The Ohio State University|year=2014|pages=3}}</ref> One of these issues was the position on the visitation of the Prophet's tomb.

He observes that with regard to visiting the Prophet’s grave, ''ulama'' rely only upon hadiths according to which the Prophet must be greeted (''al-salam wa al-salat alayhi'').56 As for the contents of hadiths encouraging visitation, they contradict the principle of ''tawhid al-uluhiya''.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810233401/https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/cp/CP2.pdf|archive-date=10 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

This view of Ibn Taymiyyah was rejected by some mainstream Sunni scholars both during his life and after his death.

===Buddhism===
[[File:Shrine outside Wat Phnom.jpg|thumb|180px|Buddhist shrine just outside [[Wat Phnom]]]]
In [[Buddhism]], a shrine refers to a place where veneration is focused on the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] or one of the [[bodhisattva]]s. Monks, nuns and laypeople all give offerings to these revered figures at these shrines and also [[meditation|meditate]] in front of them.

Typically, Buddhist shrines contain a statue of either the Buddha, or (in the [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana]] forms of Buddhism), one of the various bodhisattvas.<ref>[http://www.buddhamind.info/leftside/actives/shrine.htm Srine]. buddhamind.info</ref> They also commonly contain candles, along with offerings such as flowers, purified water, food, and incense. Many shrines also contain sacred relics, such as the alleged [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|tooth of the Buddha]] held at a shrine in [[Sri Lanka]].

Site-specific shrines in Buddhism, particularly those that contain relics of deceased buddhas and revered monks, are often [[Buddhist architecture|designed in the traditional form]] known as the [[stupa]].

===Germanic paganism===
In [[Germanic paganism]], types of shrines were employed, but terms for the shrines show some level of ambiguity:
*''[[Hörgr]]s'', which may have originally exclusively referred to "holy places", whereas its Old English cognate ''hearg'' could mean "[[Sacred grove|holy grove]]" and/or "temple, idol"<ref name=SIMEK156>[[Rudolf Simek]] (2007), translated by Angela Hall.

*''[[Vé (shrine)|Vé]]s'' (Old Norse) or ''wēohs'' (Old English), referring to either a types of shrines or sacred enclosures. The term appears in [[skald]]ic poetry and in place names in [[Scandinavia]] (with the exception of [[Iceland]]), often in connection with a [[List of Germanic deities|Norse deity]] or a geographic feature. The name of the Norse god [[Vili and Vé|Vé]], refers to the practice.<ref name=NORSEGOD>[[Rudolf Simek|Simek, Rudolf]] (2007), translated by Angela Hall.

In [[Hinduism]], a shrine is a place where gods or goddesses are worshipped. Shrines are typically located inside a [[Hindu temple]] of various forms. Most Hindu families have a household shrine as well. For example, according to memoirs of Stephen Huyler of his visits to some Hindu homes, a part of home was dedicated to the household shrine. Here, image of a deity was placed and offered prayers, instead of visits to a temple.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Huyler|first1=Stephen P.

===Taoism===
[[File:D303- un prêtre taôiste. - L1-Ch5.png|thumb|A Taoist shrine.]]
The line between a [[temple]] and a shrine in [[Taoism]] is not fully defined;  shrines are usually smaller versions of larger Taoist temples or small places in a [[home]] where a [[taijitu|yin-yang]] emblem is placed among peaceful settings to encourage meditation and study of Taoist texts and principles.  Taoists place less emphasis on formalized attendance but include ritualized worship than other [[Eastern religions|Asian religions]];  formal temples and structures of worship came about in Taoism mostly in order to prevent losing adherents to [[Buddhism]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Frequent features of Taoist shrines include the same features as full temples, often including any or all of the following features: [[garden]]s, running water or fountains, small burning [[brazier]]s or candles (with or without [[incense]]), and copies of Taoist texts such as the [[Tao Te Ching]], [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] or other texts by [[Lao Tzu]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang Tzu]] or other Taoist sages.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Confucianism==
A number of Confucian temples and shrines exist across the sinophone world. Often in Chinese they are called 文庙 or "culture temples".
Like Taoist temples they consist of gardens and then a large pavilion where incense is burnt. However inside the shrine a statue of Confucius or Mencius is held.

Confucian shrines are often adorned with messages to the sage (God of learning) mainly wishing for good luck in exams.

Confucian shrines exist outside of China too, for example in Naha, Okinawa. However some Buddhist temples reserve a room for Confucius also.

==Secular shrines==
In the United States and some other countries, [[landmark]]s may be called "historic shrines." Notable shrines of this type include:
* [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|The Alamo]] in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]], U.S.
* [[Fort McHenry]] in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], U.S.
