'''Donald William Wuerl''' (born November 12, 1940) is an American [[prelate]] of the [[Catholic Church]], and was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington|Archbishop of Washington, D.C.]], from 2006 to 2018. He was elevated by [[Pope John Paul II]] to serve as [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle|Auxiliary Bishop of Seattle]] (1986–1987), and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh|Bishop of Pittsburgh]] (1988–2006). He was named Archbishop of Washington by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] by him in 2010. 

Wuerl was widely regarded as a theological moderate, and was well respected in the Church for his ability to forge consensus between different factions. However, accusations in 2018 that Wuerl had failed to adequately deal with allegations of sexual abuse damaged his reputation. He was the subject of a [[Grand jury investigation of Catholic Church sexual abuse in Pennsylvania|2018 Pennsylvania grand jury report]] that largely criticized how he handled sexual abuse cases during his time in Pittsburgh. Wuerl has denied mishandling the cases. On October 12, 2018, [[Pope Francis]] accepted his resignation as Archbishop of Washington. Wuerl remained in charge of the archdiocese as its [[Apostolic administration|apostolic administrator]] until Pope Francis appointed his successor, [[Wilton Daniel Gregory]], in 2019. He remains a member of the [[College of Cardinals]], and was eligible to vote in a [[Papal conclave|papal election]] until November 2020.<ref>{{cite news | first=Daniel |last=Burke | title =Abuse survivors angry over Pope's praise for fallen cardinal | publisher = CNN |date= 12 October 2018 |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/12/us/cardinal-wuerl-resignation/index.html}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Donald Wuerl was born on November 12, 1940, in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].

He continued his studies at the [[Pontifical North American College]] in [[Rome]].<ref name=cardinals/> He earned a master's degree in theology from the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] in 1967. After ordination, Wuerl was sent to Rome for further theological study. He is an [[List of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas|alumnus]] of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas ''Angelicum'']] where he obtained a [[Doctor of Sacred Theology]] in 1974.<ref name="Smith1"/>

While a student in Rome, Wuerl had the chance to observe the proceedings of the [[Second Vatican Council]].<ref name="Smith1"/>

=== Early career ===
He was [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|ordained a priest]] on December 17, 1966.<ref name="Diopitt">[http://www.diopitt.org/wel_former_bishops.php Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh – History of Bishops Webpage – Retrieved on October 18, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231014722/http://www.diopitt.org/wel_former_bishops.php |date=December 31, 2009 }}</ref> His first assignment was as assistant pastor at [[Saint Rosalia|St. Rosalia]] parish in Pittsburgh's [[Greenfield (Pittsburgh)|Greenfield]] neighborhood and as secretary to Pittsburgh's Bishop [[John Wright (cardinal)|John Wright]]. After Wright was elevated to cardinal in 1969, Wuerl was his full-time secretary in [[Vatican City]] from 1969 until Wright's death in 1979. Because Wright was recovering from surgery and confined to a wheelchair, Wuerl, as Wright's secretary, was one of three non-cardinals permitted inside the [[Papal conclave, October 1978|conclave]] that selected Karol Wojtyla as [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1978.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghcatholic.org/PrintPage/1978-with-john-paul-ii-a-new-era-began-for-the-church|title=1978: With John Paul II, a New Era Began for the Church|last=Almade|first=Frank D.|date=September 29, 2008|work=Pittsburgh Catholic|accessdate=August 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924230652/http://www.pittsburghcatholic.org/PrintPage/1978-with-john-paul-ii-a-new-era-began-for-the-church|archive-date=September 24, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Filteau|first1=Jerry|title=Wuerl in 1978 Conclave That Elected John Paul II|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/wuerl-1978-conclave-elected-john-paul-ii|accessdate=August 25, 2016|work=National Catholic Reporter|date=November 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | accessdate = August 25, 2016 | title = Cardinal Donald Wuerl: The Pope's Man in Washington | first = David | last= Gibson | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/cardinal-donald-wuerl-the-popes-man-in-washington/2015/12/23/1623e196-a995-11e5-b596-113f59ee069a_story.html | newspaper = The Washington Post | date= December 23, 2015 | agency = Religion News Service}}</ref> (Wright had missed the first of the two 1978 conclaves.)

Wuerl was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] at [[Saint Paul Seminary (Pittsburgh)|Saint Paul Seminary]] in Pittsburgh from 1981 to 1985. In 1982, he was made executive secretary to Bishop [[John Aloysius Marshall|John Marshall]] of Burlington, Vermont, who was leading a Vatican-mandated study of US [[seminary|seminaries]].<ref>{{cite book|title = A Clear and Quiet Conscience: The Archbishop Who Challenged a Pope, a President, and a Church |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-qxkBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT217 |first=John A. |last=McCoy |publisher=Orbis Books |isbn=9781608335459 |date=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=September 23, 1981 |first=Kenneth A. |last=Briggs |title=Vatican Will Investigate U.S. Seminaries with Aid of Bishops |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/23/us/vatican-will-investigate-us-seminaries-with-aid-of-bishops.html |access-date=August 25, 2016}}</ref>

== Episcopal career ==
=== Auxiliary Bishop of Seattle ===
On December 3, 1985, Wuerl was appointed titular bishop of [[Rosemarkie]] and auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Seattle. Wuerl was consecrated bishop on January 6, 1986,<ref name="Diopitt"/> at [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, Italy, by Pope John Paul II. Wuerl and Seattle Archbishop [[Raymond Hunthausen]] worked in adjoining offices without conflict for several months until, in May 1986, they found themselves with opposing positions on proposed state legislation to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in employment.<ref name=striving>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=August 24, 2016 |date=December 9, 1986 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/09/us/2-bishops-of-seattle-striving-to-work-with-split-powers.html |title=2 Bishops of Seattle Striving to Work with Split Powers |first=Wallace |last=Turner }}</ref> At that point Hunthausen learned for the first time that Wuerl had been charged with responsibility—"complete and final decision-making power"—for several key areas normally within the Archbishop's control: worship and liturgy; the archdiocesan tribunal that considers requests for [[Declaration of nullity|marriage annulment]]; [[Seminary|seminarians]], [[Formation in the Catholic Church|priestly formation]] and [[Loss of clerical state (Catholic Church)|laicized priests]]; moral issues; and issues of health care and ministry to homosexuals.<ref>{{cite dissertation |title=Conflict in the Catholic Hierarchy: A Study of Coping Strategies in the Hunthausen Affair, with Preferential Attention to Discursive Strategies |type=doctoral dissertation |last=Schilling |first=Timothy Peter |location=Utrecht, Netherlands |publisher=Utrecht University |year=2003 |hdl=1874/601 |hdl-access=free}}</ref> The division of authority only became public when Hunthausen announced it in September 1986.<ref name=curtail>{{cite news |title=Vatican Moves to Curtail Power of a Liberal Prelate in Seattle |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/05/us/vatican-moves-to-curb-power-of-a-liberal-prelate-in-seattle.html |access-date=August 25, 2016 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=September 5, 1986}}</ref>

While some chancery officials expressed support for Wuerl, some questioned his role and saw little impact a year after his appointment.<ref name=striving/> In November, Hunthausen won support for his objections to the Vatican's restrictions on his authority from the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|US Conference of Catholic Bishops]].<ref name=visit>{{cite news |accessdate = August 24, 2016 | date = February 16, 1987| title = Pope Meets with Wuerl in Hunthausen Controversy | agency = UPI | url = http://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/02/16/Pope-meets-with-Wuerl-in-Hunthausen-controversy/3647540450000/ }}</ref>

In February 1987, the Vatican announced that a commission of US bishops would investigate the situation in Seattle, and Wuerl met privately with Pope John Paul II and declined to comment, saying "I'm just going to wait and see what the commission does".<ref name=visit/> In May 1987, following a review by the commission headed by Cardinal [[Joseph Bernardin]], Pope John Paul II restored Hunthausen's full authority as bishop, and appointed [[Thomas Joseph Murphy]] as [[coadjutor]] to assist and succeed Hunthausen.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | accessdate = August 24, 2016 | date = May 27, 1987 | first = Russell | last = Chandler | title = Pope Restores Full Powers to Hunthausen | url = http://articles.latimes.com/1987-05-27/news/mn-1742_1_bishops }}</ref> 

Wuerl resigned as auxiliary bishop of Seattle on May 26, 1987. He later said the arrangement had been "unworkable". Following the restoration of Hunthausen's authority, Wuerl moved to a Pittsburgh suburb to await his next posting.<ref>{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=August 24, 2016 |title=Bishop Calls for Sharing of Authority an Unworkable Venture in Seattle |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/24/us/bishop-calls-for-sharing-of-authority-an-unworkable-venture-in-seattle.html}}</ref>

Wuerl and Hunthausen eventually became friends. Wuerl said that Hunthausen taught him a great deal about the work of being a bishop.<ref name="Crux1">{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=John L. |title=Abuse scandal isn't the only chapter in Donald Wuerl's story |url=https://cruxnow.com/news-analysis/2018/10/12/abuse-scandal-isnt-the-only-chapter-in-donald-wuerls-story/ |website=Crux |publisher=Crux Catholic Media Inc. |accessdate=10 December 2018}}</ref>

=== Bishop of Pittsburgh ===
Wuerl was appointed the eleventh bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh|Diocese of Pittsburgh]] on February 12, 1988 and [[Installation (Christianity)|installed]] on March 25, 1988.<ref name="Diopitt"/>

One of the biggest problems facing the diocese was financial in nature and came from its school system. Many of the parishes were built when Catholic immigrants were swelling the population of Pittsburgh to work in the steel mills. During this era, parishes were established along ethnic lines so that parishioners could attend services in their native tongues and maintain their national traditions. This resulted in having as many as six-to-eight parishes within blocks of each other. After World War II, there was a major effort to build a school for every parish. These schools were usually staffed by nuns who were given nominal compensation. This system began to break down in the 1970s. First, the Baby Boom subsided, resulting in a reduction in student population. Second, Catholics became less likely to send their children to Catholic schools. Third, during this period there was a massive culture shift among nuns, partially in response to Vatican II, that resulted in many sisters choosing missions unrelated to education. They had to be replaced as teachers with lay staff paid market salaries.<ref name="Book1">{{cite book |last1=Rodgers |first1=Ann |last2=Aquilina |first2=Mark |title=Something More Pastoral: The Mission of Bishop, Archbishop, and Cardinal Donald Wuerl |date=2015 |publisher=Lambing Press}}</ref>

Bishop Wuerl asked his committee of lay advisors to address the debt and deficit spending associated with Catholic education in Pittsburgh. In 1988, that committee determined that 48 of the then 333 parishes owed a total of $5.6 million. A rescue plan was made public in February 1989, Bishop Wuerl announcing that $1.1 million owed to the diocese for insurance and the Parish Share Program would be forgiven. Indebted parishes would be given low-interest loans to refinance their other obligations. Despite the financial condition of the diocese, Bishop Wuerl decided to expand health services. Bishop Wuerl worked with hospitals and community groups to create a group home for people suffering from AIDS, this when AIDS was little understood and almost always fatal. In 2003, Bishop Wuerl conducted a successful $2.5 million fundraising campaign to create the Catholic Charities Free Health Care Center. The clinic primarily serves the uninsured working poor.<ref name="Book1"/>

In 1989, Wuerl merged Sacred Heart and St. Paul Cathedral High Schools to establish [[Oakland Catholic High School]] (all three female-only schools) in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh, using the buildings of St. Paul Cathedral High School.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.oaklandcatholic.org/about-oc/history |title=History |publisher = Oakland Catholic High School }}</ref>

Wuerl launched and hosted a television program, ''The Teaching of Christ'', in 1990 and wrote an adult [[catechism]] with the same name. He taught at [[Duquesne University]] in Pittsburgh as a distinguished service professor. Wuerl has served as a [[chaplain]] since 1999 for the Order of Malta, Federal Association USA, attached to the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], commonly referred to as the Knights of Malta.<ref>http://www.orderofmalta-federal.org/chaplains {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727153930/http://www.orderofmalta-federal.org/chaplains |date=July 27, 2011 }} Order Of Malta Federal Association, USA official website – The Chaplains of the Order of Malta, Federal Association webpage – Retrieved on November 10, 2008</ref> Wuerl has also written regular columns in ''Columbia'', the major publication of the [[Knights of Columbus]] in the United States.<ref>Knights of Columbus. http://www.kofc.org/un/eb/en/publications/columbia/archive/bishop_wuerl.html</ref>

Under Bishop Wuerl, the diocese had to reorganize itself in response to demographic changes, the decline of the steel industry, and the Church's weakened financial position. That process was officially completed in March 1994. Wuerl closed 73 church buildings, which included 37 churches, and reduced 331 parishes by 117 through merging. The diocese of  Pittsburgh was operating 214 parishes when Bishop Wuerl left in June 2006 to take up a May 16 appointment as Archbishop of Washington.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://triblive.com/x/archive/2052482-74/archive-story | first= Mike | last = Wereschagin | newspaper =Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |title=Bishop Zubik Will Face Many Obstacles |date=July 22, 2007|accessdate=October 23, 2008}}</ref> Wuerl's plan, ''The Parish Reorganization and Revitalization Project'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diopitt.org/news_051606.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614043713/http://www.diopitt.org/news_051606.php |archivedate=June 14, 2006 |df=mdy }} Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh official website news release – Bishop Wuerl Appointed Archbishop Of Washington – May 16, 2006 – Retrieved on October 23, 2008</ref> is now used as a model for other dioceses seeking [[Parish in the Catholic Church|parish suppression]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Under Bishop Wuerl, the diocese began to emphasize placing women into positions of responsibility and authority. Rosemarie Cibik, a former superintendent of public instruction, became the first lay superintendent of Catholic schools in Pittsburgh. Rita Joyce, a canon and civil lawyer, became the first lay member of the diocesan marriage tribunal. Sister Margaret Hannan was appointed to the position of associate general secretary of the diocese. Later she rose to the position of chancellor, the highest canonical post that can be occupied by one who is not ordained.<ref name="Book1"/>

In April 2008 Wuerl, as Archbishop of Washington, hosted the apostolic visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], which included a visit to the [[White House]], the celebration of Vespers at the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]], Mass at the new [[Nationals Park]], and an address at the [[Catholic University of America]].
[[File:WuerlFrancisVisitCut.png|260px|right|thumb|Wuerl and President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] welcome [[Pope Francis]] to United States, 2015]]
Wuerl was chairman of the board of directors of the [[National Catholic Educational Association]] from December 12, 2005,<ref>[http://www.ncea.org/news/pressrelease/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=15 National Catholic Educational Association – Press Release Webpage] – From January 4, 2006 – Retrieved on May 18, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.ncea.org/about/boardofdirectors.asp National Catholic Educational Association – Board of Directors Webpage] Retrieved on October 17, 2008</ref> and was also [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of The Catholic University of America. In September 2010, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] named Wuerl its delegate in the United States for facilitating the implementation of the [[apostolic constitution]] ''[[Personal ordinariate|Anglicanorum coetibus]]'' issued by Pope Benedict XVI in November 2009 to provide for those Anglican faithful who desire to enter into full communion with the Catholic Church in a corporate manner.<ref>{{cite press release|accessdate=August 25, 2016| publisher=US Conference of Catholic Bishops| title=Doctrine of the Faith Congregation Names Archbishop Wuerl to Guide Bringing Anglican Groups into Catholic Church in U.S. |url= http://www.usccb.org/news/2010/10-166.cfm |date=September 23, 2010}}</ref> He also heads the US bishops' ''ad hoc'' committee to support that implementation.<ref>{{cite news|last1=O'Brien|first1=Nancy Frazier|title=Report on U.S. Ordinariate for Ex-Anglicans|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/report-us-ordinariate-ex-anglicans|accessdate=August 25, 2016|work=National Catholic Reporter|agency=Catholic News Service|date=June 16, 2011}}</ref>

=== Commitment to priestly formation ===
From 1994 until 2003, as Bishop of Pittsburgh, Wuerl served as a member of the board of governors of the [[Pontifical North American College]] in Rome (Chairman, 1998–1999), representing the Pennsylvania-New Jersey Region (Region III) of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. In 2008, as Archbishop of Washington he was again elected to the college's board of governors, this time representing the Washington DC-Delaware-Maryland-Virginia-West Virginia region of the conference (Region IV).

On November 20, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI elevated Wuerl to the College of Cardinals in a public [[Papal consistory|consistory]] held at Saint Peter's Basilica in Vatican City.<ref>{{cite news |accessdate = August 25, 2016 |date=November 20, 2010 |first=Rachel |last=Donadio |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Pope Elevates Cardinals in Festive Ceremony |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/21/world/europe/21vatican.html}}</ref> He was created [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal-Priest]] of [[San Pietro in Vincoli|S.

In 2011, Wuerl faced widespread criticism for his role in the U.S. bishops' criticism of St. Joseph Sr. [[Elizabeth Johnson (theologian)|Elizabeth Johnson]], one of the "most prominent and respected theologians" in the U.S.<ref>[https://www.ncronline.org/news/accountability/wuerl-resigns-ending-influential-tenure-wake-abuse-report] Wuerl Resigns, Ending Influential Tenure in Wake of Abuse Report, October 12, 2018, National Catholic Reporter</ref> In a July 2011 letter to theologian John Thiel, then the president of the Catholic Theological Society of America, [[Timothy Dolan|Timothy Cardinal Dolan]] then president of the USCCB, explained that the bishops' administrative committee, made up of 36 bishops, mostly conference committee heads, had unanimously approved of the doctrine committee's statement regarding Johnson's book.<ref>McElwee, Joshua J.,[https://www.ncronline.org/news/theology/us-bishops-quietly-adopt-protocols-theological-investigations "US bishops quietly adopt protocols for theological investigations", ''National Catholic Reporter'', August 17, 2012]</ref> Wuerl stated that he had offered to meet Johnson but she did not respond to his invitations.<ref name="USCCB2011.10.28">{{cite press release|date=2011-10-28|title=Doctrine Committee Chair, Cardinal Wuerl, highlights multiple offers to meet with Fordham Professor Sister Elizabeth Johnson|url=http://www.usccb.org/news/2011/11-207.cfm|type=Press release|location=Washington, DC|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|access-date=2015-03-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031154712/http://www.usccb.org/news/2011/11-207.cfm|archivedate=2011-10-31|url-status=live}}</ref>

Wuerl was one of the [[Cardinal electors for the 2013 papal conclave|cardinal electors]] who participated in the [[2013 papal conclave]] that elected [[Pope Francis]].<ref>{{cite news | newspaper = The Washington Post | accessdate = August 25, 2016 | title = Rome-Bound, D.C.'s Cardinal Wuerl Says Next Pope Must Evangelize a Hectic World | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/rome-bound-dcs-cardinal-wuerl-says-next-pope-must-evangelize-a-hectic-world/2013/02/22/fb281130-7d02-11e2-9a75-dab0201670da_story.html | date= February 22, 2016 | first= Michelle | last = Boorstein}}</ref>

===United States Conference of Catholic Bishops===
Wuerl worked as a consensus builder in order to mediate ideological conflicts over issues such as liturgical translation and communion for pro-choice political leaders in the 1990s and 2000s. His consensus-building power was derived from the high level of trust he cultivated with his colleagues.<ref name="Smith1"/><ref name="Crux1"/>

Wuerl was essential to the passage of the Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People by the conference. The charter required that any clergyman who sexually abuses a child never again serve in ministry.<ref name="Smith1"/>

== Public positions ==
[[Thomas J. Reese|Thomas Reese]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest and journalist, said in 2006 that "[Wuerl is] quite orthodox theologically, but he doesn't like to play cop; he's not an authoritarian person."<ref name="popenames"/> In 2018, Reese described him as an ideological moderate with regard to Catholic theological disputes, stating, "He's not an old leftie, he's not a right-wing culture warrior.&nbsp;... He was totally enthusiastic about [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]], and then [[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Benedict]], and now he's totally enthusiastic about Pope Francis. There are not many people in the church who are totally enthusiastic about all three of them."<ref name="PhillyTrib_2018.08.16" /> Journalist John Allen, Jr. said that Wuerl "was able to forge behind-the-scenes consensus because he was trusted by virtually all parties as someone who wouldn't embarrass them in public, and because he was seen as at least somewhat sympathetic to their points of view."<ref name="Crux1"/>

=== Religion and politics ===
In cases where politicians and officeholders take policy positions that are at odds with church doctrine, Wuerl said the decision to offer communion should be made case-by-case: "Our primary job is to teach and try to convince people. The tradition in our country has not been in the direction of refusing Communion, and I think it's served us well."<ref name="popenames">{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/17/us/17archbishop.html |title=Pope Names Pittsburgh Bishop to Washington, D.C., Post |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 17, 2006 | first= Laurie | last= Goodstein |accessdate = August 24, 2016}}</ref>

In 2009, the [[Council of the District of Columbia]] passed a [[same-sex marriage]] bill. In November 2009, Wuerl signed an ecumenical statement, known as the ''[[Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience|Manhattan Declaration]]'', calling on [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]], Catholics, and [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] not to comply with rules and laws permitting [[abortion]], same-sex marriage, and other practices that go against their religious consciences.<ref>[http://demossnews.com/manhattandeclaration/press_kit/manhattan_declaration_signers Manhattan Declaration: A Call of Christian Conscience] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901171332/http://demossnews.com/manhattandeclaration/press_kit/manhattan_declaration_signers |date=September 1, 2013 }}</ref> The Catholic Church teaches that marriage is between a man and a woman and that the extension of the civil definition of marriage to same-sex couples undermines the common good of society as a whole.<ref>{{cite web |title=Subcommittee for the Promotion and Defense of Marriage: Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.usccb.org/defenseofmarriage/faqs.shtml |location=Washington |publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630005425/http://www.usccb.org/defenseofmarriage/faqs.shtml |archive-date=June 30, 2011 |access-date=September 11, 2018}}</ref> In the debate on the D.C. same-sex marriage bill, the Archdiocese of Washington advocated for religious liberty provisions that would protect the church's ability to provide social services (e.g. adoption) in accordance with Catholic teaching on marriage.<ref>[http://www.adw.org/family/marriage_ssm.asp Archdiocese of Washington website – Same Sex Marriage ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025155319/http://www.adw.org/family/marriage_ssm.asp |date=October 25, 2010 }}</ref>

=== Response to ''Dominus Iesus'' ===
In 2000, the Vatican issued a document entitled ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' which stated that [[Jesus]] Christ is the only way of [[salvation]]. Wuerl said it was aimed at some theologians in Asia who are addressing{{clarify|date=November 2018}} Hinduism, Islam and Buddhism, and it defends the Catholic view of the necessity of proclaiming the Christian faith to them. The document acknowledges that there are elements in non-Christian scriptures "by which countless people throughout the centuries have been and still are able today to nourish and maintain their life-relationship with God."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news| url = http://old.post-gazette.com/regionstate/20000907saved3.asp|title = Wuerl: Others Can Be Saved |date = September 7, 2000|accessdate = October 15, 2015| newspaper = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|last = Rodgers-Melnick|first = Ann}}</ref>

=== Response to ''Summorum pontificum'' ===
After Pope Benedict XVI issued the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'' (2007) authorizing [[Latin Church]] priests to celebrate [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] using either the [[Roman Missal]] as revised in 1969 or the 1962 edition, Wuerl said that Pope Benedict was "trying to reach out pastorally to those who feel an attraction to this form of the liturgy, and he is asking the pastors to be aware of and support their interest". He added that about 500 people a week were attending celebrations of the [[Tridentine Mass]] at three places in his archdiocese.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0703915.htm |archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070710201958/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0703915.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date= July 10, 2007 |first= Nancy Frazier |last= O'Brien |title= U.S. Bishops Say Pope Affirming Importance of Mass in Both Its Forms |publisher= Catholic News Service |date= July 10, 2007 }}</ref> He had a circular sent to his priests about a special committee that he would establish "to assist pastors in evaluating and responding to requests for the regular and public celebration" of the 1962 form of Mass.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} As of 2017, the Tridentine Mass was reported on the Archdiocesan website as celebrated weekly in three parishes, the same ones as in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |title=Masses in Various Languages |url=http://www.adw.org/foreign-language-parishes |publisher=Archdiocese of Washington website |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701231413/http://adw.org/foreign-language-parishes/ |archive-date=July 1, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Support for Pope Francis===
Wuerl has been an important and public supporter of Pope Francis within the American hierarchy. While many American Catholic leaders have criticized Francis, Wuerl has consistently defended him.<ref name="Crux1"/>

== Clerical sexual abuse ==
Wuerl was widely considered to be a bishop who was proactive in confronting [[Catholic sex abuse cases|sexual abuse]].<ref name="post-gazette.com"/> Wuerl won plaudits and criticism for his efforts to remove sexually abusive clergy years before other church leaders made similar efforts.<ref name="Smith1"/> After the release of a [[Grand jury investigation of Catholic Church sexual abuse in Pennsylvania|grand jury investigation report]] in August 2018, he received a great deal of criticism for how he had handled some abuse cases.<ref name="CNN_2018.08.29" /><ref name="WSJ_2018.09.04" />

===1988 to 2018===
In September 1988, when Wuerl was the Bishop of Pittsburgh, he accepted a dinner invitation from a family suing the diocese for sexual abuse by a priest. Although the diocese's lawyers had discouraged Wuerl from attending the dinner, Wuerl became convinced that sexual abuse was a problem in his diocese. Wuerl settled the lawsuit with the family, and the priest involved was [[defrocking|laicized]] and eventually ended up in prison. Wuerl told his staff that in cases of alleged sexual abuse, the first concern should be for the victim, the second concern should be for the victim's family, and only third should clergy consider the reputation of the Church.<ref name="post-gazette.com"/>

In the years that followed, Wuerl investigated every priest in his diocese accused of sexual misconduct and removed several. On one occasion, Wuerl laicized a priest whom the Vatican initially had protected, Anthony Cipolla.<ref name="post-gazette.com"/> Cipolla was ordained in 1972. In 1978, he was charged with [[sexual abuse]] of a 9-year-old boy; these charges were dropped by the mother, who said she was pressured to do so by Bishop [[Vincent Leonard]].<ref name=PG2002>{{cite news|last1=Rodgers-Melnick|first1=Ann|title=Rare sanction imposed on priest|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/localnews/20021116cipollareg4p4.asp|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=November 16, 2002}}</ref> In 1988 new charges were brought by another man, who said that Cipolla abused him from around 1981 to 1986; this case was settled in 1993, over Cipolla's objections. Cipolla consistently said that he never abused anyone.<ref name=PG2002/>

In 1988, Bishop Wuerl banned Cipolla from ministry and from identifying himself as a priest; Cipolla appealed to the Supreme Tribunal of the [[Apostolic Signatura]], the Vatican's highest court, which ordered Bishop Wuerl to return him to ministry.<ref name=PG2002/><ref name=Sun2002>{{cite news|last1=Gibson|first1=Gail|last2=Rivera|first2=John|title=Maryland center claims success treating priests|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-04-11/news/0204110181_1_luke-priests-sexual-abuse|work=Baltimore Sun|date=April 11, 2002|language=en}}</ref> Bishop Wuerl asked the court to reconsider the case on the grounds that its decision showed a lack of awareness of crucial facts such as a civil lawsuit and Cipolla's 1978 arrest for sexually abusing another boy. The court reversed its ruling in 1995 and upheld Cipolla's ban. Cipolla nonetheless continued to minister to the public forcing the diocese to make several public statements that Cipolla was not in good standing. In 2002, Cipolla was laicized by the pope.<ref name=PG2002/><ref name=Obit>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Peter|title=Obituary: Anthony Cipolla / Center of high-profile sex-abuse case in 1990s, dies in Ohio|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/obituaries/2016/09/13/Obituary-Anthony-Cipolla-Center-of-high-profile-sex-abuse-case-in-1990s-dies-in-Ohio/stories/201609130049|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=13 September 2016|language=en}}</ref>

According to a ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' article written in 2003, Wuerl had "a national reputation for zero tolerance of priests who molest minors" at the time.<ref name="post-gazette.com">{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20030615wuerl0615p2.asp |title= Wuerl's Tough Record on Sex Abuse Spurs Speculation of Move to Boston | newspaper =Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | date=June 15, 2003 |first= Ann | last= Rodgers-Melnick | accessdate = August 24, 2016}}</ref>

In 2010, Wuerl argued that the church had made progress in confronting abusers. He told ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'' that "we have succeeded in guaranteeing that if a priest is accused, and there is a credible allegation, he is simply removed from the ministry. That is reported to the authorities, and we begin to try to heal whatever was damaged in that abuse."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wltx.com/error/404|title=WLTX.com|website=WLTX}}</ref>

George Zirwas had a long history of involvement in child sexual abuse, sometimes including sadism. He had also manufactured child pornography. Zirwas' actions were known in the Diocese of Pittsburgh as early as 1987, but he continued in ministry when Wuerl became bishop of Pittsburgh in 1988. In 1989, Wuerl authorized a $900,000 settlement, with confidentiality clauses, with two of Zirwas' victims, but Zirwas remained in ministry until at least 1991 despite further complaints. After another complaint was made, Wuerl removed Zirwas in 1996. Eventually Zirwas moved to Cuba, where he was murdered in 2001.<ref name="NYMag_2018.08.17">{{cite news |date=August 17, 2018 |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sullivan |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |title=Cleansing the Catholic Church of Its Sins |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/08/cleansing-the-catholic-church-of-its-sins.html |access-date=August 21, 2018}}</ref><ref name="CNN_2018.08.19"/>

===Alleged sexual abuse by Theodore McCarrick===
{{main | Carlo Maria Viganò}}
On August 25, 2018, Archbishop [[Carlo Maria Viganò]] released an 11-page letter describing a series of warnings to the [[Holy See|Vatican]] on sexual misconduct by [[Theodore McCarrick]], Wuerl's predecessor as Archbishop of Washington, and subsequent alleged coverup by the Vatican and senior Church officials, whom he claimed were aware of the allegations but refused to act.<ref name="CNA_2018.08.25">{{cite news |url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/ex-nuncio-accuses-pope-francis-of-failing-to-act-on-mccarricks-abuse-reports-81797 |title=Ex-nuncio accuses Pope Francis of failing to act on McCarrick's abuse reports |last=Pentin |first=Edward |date=August 25, 2018 |publisher=[[Catholic News Agency]] |access-date=August 30, 2018}}</ref>  Viganò stated that he had discussed McCarrick's conduct and the penalties surrounding it with Wuerl and accused him of putting seminarians at risk by allowing McCarrick to reside at the Redemptoris Mater Archdiocesan Seminary despite knowing that he was accused of abusing seminarians.<ref name="CNA8252018">{{cite web |url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/wuerl-denies-he-was-informed-of-vatican-restrictions-on-mccarrick-83657 |title=Wuerl denies he was informed of Vatican restrictions on McCarrick |last=Flynn |first=J.&nbsp;D. |date=August 25, 2018 |publisher=Catholic News Agency |access-date=August 30, 2018}}</ref>

Through a spokesman, Wuerl denied that he was aware of McCarrick's misconduct prior to his removal from ministry, which took place on June 20, 2018.<ref name="CNA8252018"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/cardinal-wuerl-acknowledges-calls-for-new-leadership-11847 |title=Cardinal Wuerl acknowledges calls for 'new leadership' |date=September 6, 2018 |publisher=Catholic News Agency |access-date=May 30, 2019}}</ref> However, on January 10, 2019, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published a story stating that Wuerl, despite his past denials, was aware of allegations against McCarrick in 2004 and reported them to the Vatican.<ref name="washingtonpost_2019-01-10">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/2019/01/10/b542cbba-1513-11e9-803c-4ef28312c8b9_story.html |title=Despite past denials, D.C.

Both the Diocese of Pittsburgh and the Archdiocese of Washington acknowledged that Wuerl knew about and had reported Ciolek's allegation to the Vatican. The Archdiocese of Washington said that Wuerl did not intend to be "imprecise" in his earlier denials, and that they referred only to claims of abuse against minors, not adults.<ref name="washingtonpost_2019-01-10"/> Days later, Wuerl himself apologized, stating that his earlier denials were the result of a "lapse of memory." Ciolek refused to believe that Wuerl forgot and did not accept his apology.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/01/16/cardinal-wuerl-apologizes-priests-mccarrick-victim-says-he-forgot-he-knew-about-harassment-allegations |title=Wuerl apologizes to priests, McCarrick victim, says he forgot about harassment allegations |last=Boorstein |first=Michelle |date=January 16, 2019 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=January 17, 2019}}</ref>
 	
On May 28, 2019, correspondence from McCarrick written in 2008 was obtained by ''Crux''. In it, McCarrick refers to travel restrictions which were placed on him by Benedict XVI that same year after allegations of sexual misconduct. However, McCarrick gradually began to resume travelling. In a 2008 letter to [[Pietro Sambi]], apostolic nuncio to the U.S., McCarrick wrote he had shared a Vatican letter explaining the restrictions with Wuerl, saying that his "help and understanding is, as always, a great help and fraternal support to me." However, a spokesperson for Wuerl denied that he had any knowledge of the sanctions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-usa/2019/05/28/mccarrick-correspondence-confirms-restrictions-speaks-to-wuerl-and-china/ |title=McCarrick correspondence confirms restrictions, speaks to Wuerl and China |date=May 28, 2019 |publisher=Crux |access-date=May 28, 2019}}</ref>

===Pittsburgh-area Lawsuits===
On August 7, 2020, it was revealed that Wuerl was named as a defendant in a new sex abuse lawsuit which was filed in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court.<ref name="wuerllawsuit">{{Cite web|title=Lawsuit against Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh accuses priest of rape {{!}} TribLIVE.com|url=https://triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-allegheny/lawsuit-against-catholic-diocese-of-pittsburgh-accuses-priest-of-rape/|access-date=2020-10-26|website=triblive.com}}</ref> The lawsuit claims that despite Wuerl's promise in 1994 that Rev.

==Resignation as Archbishop of Washington==

On October 12, 2018, Pope Francis accepted Wuerl's resignation. Wuerl had previously submitted a letter of resignation in 2015, as is standard practice for any bishop who turns 75.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/10/12/656829266/pope-accepts-resignation-of-cardinal-wuerl-archbishop-of-washington|title= Pope Accepts Resignation Of D.C.

Wuerl planned to resign in September and meet with Pope Francis before doing so. This did not happen and the Pope accepted his resignation via a letter. The letter said that Wuerl had sent a new letter to the Pope requesting that he accept his resignation on September 21.<ref name=sept21>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/12/world/cardinal-wuerl-resignation-letter/ |title=Pope Francis' letter to Cardinal Donald Wuerl |publisher=CNN |date=October 12, 2018 |accessdate=October 22, 2018}}</ref> Francis appointed him to serve as [[apostolic administrator]] of the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., until his successor was appointed.<ref>{{cite news |last1=White |first1=Christopher |title=Wuerl resigns amid papal praise, will stay as interim administrator |date=October 12, 2018 |url=https://cruxnow.com/church-in-the-usa/2018/10/12/wuerl-resigns-amid-papal-praise-will-stay-as-interim-administrator/ |newspaper=[[Crux (online newspaper)|Crux]] |access-date=October 12, 2018}}</ref> Wuerl departed as apostolic administrator when [[Wilton Gregory]] was installed as Archbishop on May 21, 2019.<ref name="wuerlleaves">{{Cite web|title=So Long, Cardinal Wuerl {{!}} Ed Condon|url=https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2019/05/so-long-cardinal-wuerl|access-date=2020-10-26|website=First Things|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Wilton Gregory installed as new archbishop of Washington|url=https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/triad/ap-top-news/2019/05/21/wilton-gregory-installed-as-new-archbishop-of-washington|access-date=2020-10-26|website=spectrumlocalnews.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/05/21/wilton-gregory-be-installed-archbishop-washington</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Sanchez (ABC7)|first=Diana DiGangi and Victoria|date=2019-05-21|title=Archbishop Wilton Gregory installed as Washington archbishop at Basilica mass|url=https://wjla.com/news/local/archbishop-wilton-gregory-installed-as-washington-archbishop|access-date=2020-10-26|website=WJLA}}</ref>

Pope Francis praised Wuerl as a "model bishop" and his reply to the resignation offered this comment: "You have sufficient elements to justify your actions and distinguish between what it means to cover up crimes or not to deal with problems, and to commit some mistakes."<ref name=retirement>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2018/10/12/pope-francis-accepts-retirement-dcs-archbishop-cardinal-wuerl-amid-criticism-wuerls-handling-abuse-claims/ |title=Pope Francis accepts resignation of D.C. archbishop Wuerl, amid criticism of the cardinal's handling of abuse claims |newspaper=Washington Post |date=October 12, 2018 |accessdate=October 13, 2018}}</ref> A ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial criticized Pope Francis for the way he characterized Wuerl's resignation and handling of abuse cases.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 12, 2018 |author=Editorial board |title=The Pope Ignores the Damage as Another Prelate Falls |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/opinion/pope-francis-donald-wuerl-abuse.html |access-date=October 12, 2018}}</ref> Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro criticized the Pope's decision to allow Wuerl to resign without facing stronger consequences.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailypress.com/sns-bc-eu--vatican-sex-abuse-20181012-story.html |title=Pennsylvania AG: Cardinal faces no penalties by resigning |agency=Associated Press |date=October 12, 2018 |accessdate=October 12, 2018}}</ref>

On October 12, Wuerl wrote to members of the archdiocese and said, "I am sorry and ask for healing for all of those who were so deeply wounded at the hands of the Church's ministers. I also beg forgiveness on behalf of Church leadership from the victims who were again wounded when they saw these priests and bishops both moved and promoted."<ref name=retirement/>
