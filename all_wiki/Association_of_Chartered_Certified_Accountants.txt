{{Accounting}}

Founded in 1904, the '''Association of Chartered Certified Accountants''' '''(ACCA)''' is the global [[professional accounting body]] offering the [[Chartered Certified Accountant]] qualification (ACCA). ACCA's headquarters are in [[London]] with principal administrative office in [[Glasgow]]. ACCA works through a network of over 104 offices and centres in 52 countries - with 323 Approved Learning Partners (ALP) and more than 7,300 Approved Employers worldwide, who provide employee development.

The term 'Chartered' in ACCA qualification refers to the [[Royal charter|Royal Charter]] granted in 1974.

'Chartered Certified Accountant' is a legally protected term. Individuals who describe themselves as Chartered Certified Accountants must be members of ACCA and if they carry out public practice engagements, must comply with additional regulations such as holding a practising certificate, carrying liability insurance and submitting to inspections.

The [[Association of Authorised Public Accountants|Association of Authorised Public Accountants (AAPA)]], one of the [[British qualified accountants|British professional bodies for public accountants]], has been a subsidiary of ACCA since 1996.

ACCA works in the public interest, ensuring that its members are appropriately regulated. It promotes [[Accounting ethics#Principles and rules|principles-based regulation]]. ACCA actively seeks to enhance the value of accounting in society through international research. It takes progressive stances on global issues to ensure accountancy as a profession continues to grow in reputation and influence.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable sources needed for the whole paragraph|date=April 2019}}

==History==
ACCA traces its origin to 1904, when eight people formed the London Association of Accountants to allow more open access to the profession than was available through the accounting bodies at the time, notably the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] (ICAEW) and the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]] (ICAS). As of 2006, the goal of ACCA is to become the world's largest global professional body. ACCA members are known as '''UAECA''' in United Arab Emirates.

ACCA offers the following certifications:

=== Chartered Certified Accountant (ACCA) ===
Chartered Certified Accountant is the professional body's main qualification. Following completion of up to 13 professional examinations, three years of supervised, relevant accounting experience and an ethics module, it enables an individual to become a Chartered Certified Accountant. The ACCA professional examinations are offered worldwide four times yearly in March, June, September and December as paper-based and computer-based exams. On-demand computer-based exams (CBE) are also offered for the first four exams (AB, MA, FA, LW), and Session CBEs for the rest (PM, TX, FR, AA, FM) which are available to be taken at ACCA licensed exam centres.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/student/exam-entry-and-administration/computer-based-exams.html|title=Computer-based exams|website=www.accaglobal.com|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref> A Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree in Applied Accounting (after completing the Fundamentals level of the exams, the Ethics and Professional Skills module and submitting a Research and Analysis project), is offered in association with [[Oxford Brookes University]].

From September 2018 onward, the syllabus comprises 13 examinations and an Ethics and Professional Skills module (EPSM),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://future.accaglobal.com/changes-to-the-qualification/the-qualification-journey|title=The ACCA Qualification journey|website=future.accaglobal.com|access-date=2018-12-11}}</ref> although some exemptions are available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/help/exemptions-calculator.html|title=Exemptions calculator|website=www.accaglobal.com|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref> In April 2019, a Data Analytics unit was added in EPSM .

The qualification is structured in three modules, plus an '''Ethics and Professional Skills module''' and a '''Professional Experience Requirement (PER)'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/qualifications/glance/acca/overview.html|title=The ACCA Qualification|website=www.accaglobal.com|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>

The Applied Knowledge level consists of 3 examinations:

* AB - Accountant in Business
* MA - Management Accounting
* FA - Financial Accounting

The Applied Skills level consists of 6 examinations:

* LW - Corporate and Business Law
* PM - Performance Management
* TX - Taxation
* FR - Financial Reporting
* AA - Audit and Assurance
* FM - Financial Management

The Strategic Professional level involves 4 examinations: 2 from Essential and any 2 from Options.

Essential (or Compulsory):

* SBL - Strategic Business Leader
*SBR - Strategic Business Reporting

Options:

* AFM - Advanced Financial Management
* APM - Advanced Performance Management
* ATX - Advanced Taxation
* AAA  - Advanced Audit and Assurance  

The ACCA full Professional qualification is regarded as the equivalent of a taught UK master's degree by the UK [[National Academic Recognition Information Centre|NARIC]] and [[Department for Education]].

Subjects include: [[Financial accounting]], [[Management accounting]], [[Financial statement|Financial reporting]], [[Tax]]ation, [[Company law]], [[audit|Audit and assurance]] and [[Corporate finance|Financial management]].

===Foundation-level qualifications - Foundations in Accountancy (FIA) ===

ACCA offers a range of foundation-level certificates and diplomas - collectively referred to as Foundations in Accountancy (FIA)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/qualifications/glance/foundation-level/overview.html|title=Foundation level|website=www.accaglobal.com|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref> - which provide an entry point for anyone new to accounting and finance and who doesn't meet the minimum entry requirements for the ACCA Qualification (which is three GCSEs and 2 A Levels or equivalent, in five separate subjects). Students can start at any level within the Foundation level, but it is recommended that students without any formal academic qualifications start with the '''Introductory Diploma in Financial and Management Accounting''' and complete exams '''Recording Financial Transactions (FA1)''' and '''Management Information (MA1)'''; then progress to the '''Intermediate Diploma in Financial and Management Accounting''' and complete exams '''Maintaining Financial Records (FA2)''' and '''Managing Costs and Finance (MA2)'''; before progressing to the '''Diploma in Accounting and Business''' and completing '''Accountant in Business (FAB)''', '''Management Accounting (FMA)''' and '''Financial Accounting (FFA)'''. Students can use the Foundation-level awards as an entry route onto the ACCA Qualification. Students who complete the Diploma in Accounting and Business will be given exemption from the first three exams of the ACCA Qualification (AB, MA and FA) and can start their studies on the ACCA Qualification with Corporate and Business Law (LW).

In order to achieve a certificate for the exams completed students must also complete a foundation ethics module called '''Foundations in Professionalism''', but this only has to be completed once, even if a student wishes to achieve both certificates and the diploma.

The Foundation-level exams are available as paper-based exams held in March, June, September and December or as on-demand computer-based exams throughout the year at ACCA licensed exam centres.

==Memberships==

===Affiliate===
Candidates register as student members to undertake the professional qualification.

Upon successful completion of the examinations, student members transfer to Affiliate status.

"For ACCA affiliates to gain admission to full membership, they must demonstrate, on the application form, that they have obtained a minimum of three years of acceptable, supervised, practical experience in an accountancy role (or roles) and have reached the required standard of competence."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/member/membership/member-ready/path-to-membership.html|title=How to become a member|website=www.accaglobal.com|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>

===Fellowship===
From 2008, Fellowship, or senior membership of ACCA, is awarded automatically based on 5 years' continuous membership, subject to compliance with [[Professional development|Continuing Professional Development]] requirements.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/qualifications/why-acca/membership.html|title=ACCA Membership and Fellowship|website=www.accaglobal.com|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>

Fellow members of ACCA use the designatory letters ''FCCA'' in place of ''ACCA.

===Continuing Professional Development===
Before 2005, Continuing Professional Development (CPD) was mandatory only for holders of 'Practicing Certificate' and 'Insolvency Licence'. From 2005 to 2007, ACCA phased in mandatory CPD requirements for all members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/member/cpd.html|title=Continuing professional development (CPD)|website=www.accaglobal.com|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>

==Legal and mutual recognition==

===Europe===

====United Kingdom and Ireland====
The ACCA or Chartered Certified Accountant qualification is fully recognised in both the United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

* Under its [[Charter]], ACCA works in the public interest.
* It is a Designated Professional Body under the [[Financial Services and Markets Act 2000|Financial Services and Markets Act]], business activities.
* It is a ''Recognised Professional Body'' under the [[Insolvency Act 1986|Insolvency Act]] to issue permits to individual ''Chartered Certified Accountants'' to conduct insolvency appointments.
* It is also a ''Recognised Qualifying Body'' and ''Recognised Supervisory Body'' in relation to company auditing under the [[Companies Act]] of 1989.
* ACCA is a member of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB). Members of these bodies are deemed to hold equivalent-level qualifications and advertisements for jobs often state that an organisation is looking for a CCAB-qualified individual.
* Full members of CCAB organisations including ACCA could apply for ICAEW membership subject to certain criteria.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icaew.com/membership/becoming-a-member/members-of-other-bodies/members-of-other-bodies-a-z/acca-members-join-icaew|title=Join ICAEW as an ACCA member|publisher=icaew.com|accessdate=2019-01-10}}</ref>
* Only ACCA, ICAEW, ICAS, [[Association of International Accountants]] (AIA) and [[Chartered Accountants Ireland]] (CA Ireland) are able to authorise members to conduct audit, insolvency and investment business work in both the United Kingdom and Ireland.
* Outside these countries, legal recognition by government authorities and mutual recognition by equivalent overseas institutes, varies. Where full legal or mutual recognition is not available, ACCA members can sometimes obtain ''[[Transfer credit|advanced standing]]'' in terms of sitting local accountancy examinations. ACCA's strong global reputation may make it unnecessary to acquire a local designation.
* Similarly, many universities and educational providers recognise ACCA as equivalent to at least a [[Bachelor's degree]] in accountancy, for the purpose of obtaining credit towards a local master's degree or an advanced study program.

The [[Quality and Qualifications Ireland]] (QQI) assigned ACCA Qualification to 'Level 8' of the Irish [[National Framework of Qualifications]] (NFQ) in 2018. Level 8 holds Irish postgraduate qualifications, such as postgraduate diplomas and master's degrees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://qsearch.qqi.ie/WebPart/RecognitionDetails?recognitionCode=1270|title=Award at Level 6|website=qsearch.qqi.ie|access-date=2018-12-11}}</ref>

In 2011, the [[Financial Reporting Council]] (FRC; then Professional Oversight Board) published information for the first time about its concerns over self-regulation by particular institutes. Press reports highlighted comments about ACCA, which had implemented recommendations to improve its examination syllabus, but needed to pay greater attention to monitoring long-time members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/2095994/pob-regulation-report-names-shames-institutes|title=POB regulation report names and shames institutes|last=Orlik|first=Rose|date=2011-07-22|website=www.accountancyage.com|access-date=2011-07-28}}</ref> In 2011, 2012 and 2013 the ACCA professional body had the highest percentage of A&B (best) outcomes from FRC's Recognised Supervisory Body (RSB) visits to a sample of 'Registered UK Audit Firms'. ACCA firms tend to audit smaller and less complex clients.

At the end of 2016 there were over 88,000 members and 90,000 students in the UK & Ireland.

====European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) & Switzerland====
The ACCA qualification is legally recognized by all member countries of the [[European Union]] under the [[European professional qualification directives|Mutual Recognition Directive]]. This recognition extends to the [[European Economic Area]] nations and [[Switzerland]]. For example, a holder of the ACCA could practice as an accountant in all member countries of the European Union, European Economic Area and Switzerland, describing himself/herself as ''ACCA'' or ''Chartered Certified Accountant''. Access to local professional qualifications requires a separate test.

At the end of 2016 there were over 16,000 members and almost 60,000 students in Europe (excluding the UK & Ireland).

====Turkey====
ACCA and the Union of Chambers of Certified Public Accountants of Turkey (TÜRMOB) signed a partnership agreement in 2004 which enables TÜRMOB members resident in [[Turkey]] to follow the ACCA Strategic Professional level and achieve ACCA membership.

===North America===
====United States====

* In June 2012, ACCA and [[Institute of Management Accountants]] (IMA) announced a strategic partnership. The two bodies joined forces to empower accountants and financial professionals to drive business performance. In January 2013, the ICMA Board of Regents, representing the certification division of IMA, voted to waive its usual bachelor's degree requirement for ACCA members wishing to earn IMA's [[Certified Management Accountant]] (CMA) credential. The bachelor's degree waiver will allow all ACCA members around the world, regardless of background, access to IMA's CMA credential. This is a benefit to ACCA members who wish to have a US-based credential.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/member/membership/partner-quals/ima.html|title=Certified Management Accountant (CMA) credential|website=www.accaglobal.com|access-date=2018-12-11}}</ref>
* There is no mutual recognition between ACCA and the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA)/[[National Association of State Boards of Accountancy]] (NASBA).

At the end of 2016 there were 2,015 members in the US.

====Canada====
ACCA announced a Mutual Recognition Agreement with [[Certified General Accountant]] (CGA Canada) effective from 1 January 2007; renewed in 2011 for a further 5 years period until December 2017.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/member/membership/mutual-memberships.html|title=Mutual memberships|website=www.accaglobal.com|access-date=2018-12-11}}</ref> {{As of|2006}}, [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants]] (CICA), [[World Education Services]] and the [[Odette School of Business]] at the [[University of Windsor]] indicated that the evaluation recognized ACCA as having the Canadian equivalence of a bachelor's degree (four years) in Accounting. The Canadian branch of ACCA is pursuing recognition for statutory audit purposes in the province of [[Ontario]] under the province's ''Public Accounting Act of 2004.''

Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants and [[Certified Management Accountants of Canada]] (CMA Canada) announced a joint qualification '[[Chartered Professional Accountant]] or CPA Designation', but whether this designation will impinge on ACCA's application for recognition in Ontario is uncertain.

On November 29, 2012, the ACCA opened up legal proceedings against the CICA to operate in Canada, complicated by the merger of the accounting profession in Canada, incorporating CICA, CMA Canada and CGA to use 'Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA)'. A 10-year transitional period  requires all CPA members to use CPA, 'legacy designation' rather than the newer designation. The merger completed in 2015.

At the end of 2016 there were 3,011 members in Canada.

An Agreement of Recognition Arrangement (ARA) between ACCA and [[Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (HKICPA; local statutory accountancy body) was put in place on 22 August 2006, backdated to 1 July 2005. This was less flexible than the previous rule.

This notwithstanding, HKICPA members could join in ACCA without any further requirement.
