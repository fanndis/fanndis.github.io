Prior to her entrance into politics, Chen was one of the eight prominent dissidents, namely "[[Kaohsiung Incident|Kaohsiung Eight]]", arrested and charged after the Kaohsiung Incident in 1979. She [[Political prisoner|was put behind bars]] for almost six years during the [[martial law in Taiwan|martial law period in Taiwan]].

Chen had also served in various capacities with the [[Taipei]] and [[Kaohsiung]] city governments between 1995 and 2000, with the latter being the year when she graduated from the [[National Sun Yat-sen University]] (NSYSU) with a [[Master of Public Affairs|master's degree in public affairs]]. She then served as Minister of the [[Ministry of Labor (Taiwan)|Council of Labor Affairs]], the precursor to present-day Ministry of Labor, in various [[Executive Yuan|cabinets]] between 2000 and 2005. Chen won the [[2005–06 Taiwanese local elections#Kaohsiung City Mayoral Elections|2006 Kaohsiung mayoral election]] and became the Republic of China's first directly-elected female mayor of a special municipality. She was twice reelected in [[2010 Taiwanese local elections#Kaohsiung|2010]] and [[2014 Taiwanese local elections#Kaohsiung|2014]] with about 53% and 68% of the votes respectively.

=== 2006 Kaohsiung mayoral election ===

He argued [[Smear campaign|airing of a video]], produced by Chen's campaign team, on the eve of the election resulted in his loss. The [[District Courts (Taiwan)#List of District Courts|Kaohsiung District Court]] ruled in favor of Huang in one of the lawsuits, thus nullifying the election.<ref name="Annulment">{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/06/18/2003365753|title=Analysis: Kaohsiung mayorship annulment could benefit DPP|date=2007-06-18|accessdate=2009-08-06|work=The Taipei Times  }}</ref>

Chen expressed her intention to appeal to the court upon knowing the verdict. She claimed it would be a [[political suicide]] if she accepted the ruling. While her colleague and [[Democratic Progressive Party]] legislator [[Kuan Bi-ling]] advised Chen to concede,<ref name="Annulment"/> Chen nonetheless appealed the ruling. There were speculations on whether Kuan, who lost to Chen during the [[Primary election|primaries]], made the remark out of personal interest.<ref name="Annulment"/>

=== Chienchen River cleanup ===
Chen assured the public in April 2009 she would improve the [[water quality]] of [[Chienchen River]], nicknamed "[[Heilongjiang|Heilungchiang]]" by the locals for its apparent pollution. She pledged [[New Taiwan dollar|NT$]]120&nbsp;million to implement the [[water treatment]] project. Chen vowed to make [[Kaohsiung]] a city not just notable for the beauty of the [[Love River]].<ref>{{cite news|work=Liberty Times |location=Taiwan (ROC)|url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2009/new/apr/7/today-south16.htm|script-title=zh:前鎮河整容 市長拍胸脯|accessdate=2009-08-06|date=2009-04-07|language=Chinese}}</ref>

=== 2009 World Games ===
Kaohsiung was the host city of [[2009 World Games]]. Chen visited [[China]] in that year to promote the Games and met with then-[[Politics of Beijing|Mayor of Beijing]] [[Guo Jinlong]]. Chen addressed then-President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] with his formal title during the meeting with Guo, which garnered much support from [[Democratic Progressive Party|her party]] and the [[Kaohsiung City Council]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=自由時報電子報|date=2009-05-23|title=陳菊赴中發聲 民進黨肯定 台聯批自爽 - 政治 - 自由時報電子報|url=https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/politics/paper/305617|access-date=2020-07-20|website=自由電子報|language=zh-Hant-TW}}</ref> However, she was criticized by several [[Taiwanese nationalism|Taiwanese localist groups]], including the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]].

Main venue of the Games, the [[National Stadium (Kaohsiung)|World Games Stadium]], was designed by Japanese architect [[Toyo Ito]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/arts/design/16stadium.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-08-06|title=Stadium Where Worlds Collide, Humanely | first=Nicolai | last=Ouroussoff}}</ref> Both the [[groundbreaking]] and completion of the Stadium occurred during Chen's tenure of mayorship.

The closing ceremony was held in the sold-out World Games Stadium, where President of the [[International World Games Association]] Ron Froehlich called the Games a "fantastic success" and declared it "the best ever".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2009/7/29/sport-beats-out-politics|work=Straits Times|location=Singapore|title=Sport beats out politics|date=2009-07-30|accessdate=2009-08-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122052803/http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2009/7/29/sport-beats-out-politics|archivedate=22 January 2010}}</ref> Tourism Bureau of Kaohsiung announced the Games generated nearly [[United States dollar|US$]]61 million in revenue for the city. The city's department stores reported a 15-percent growth in sales.

Chen was criticized for having a nap in her residence while many parts of Kaohsiung were flooded during [[Typhoon Fanapi]] on 19 September 2010.

Chen tearfully apologized, saying she felt guilty for taking a rest. Stressing that she returned her residence to change her wet clothes, Chen indicated she was also keeping a close eye on the rainstorm.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wang|first1=Flora|title=2010 ELECTIONS: Kaohsiung mayor appears in court|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/11/12/2003488316|accessdate=10 December 2014|work=Taipei Times|date=12 November 2010}}</ref> Critics called for her immediate resignation and compared Chen's behaviour to then-[[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] [[Liu Chao-shiuan]]'s haircut and then-Secretary-General of the [[Executive Yuan]] [[Hsueh Hsiang-chuan|Hsieh Hsiang-chuan]]'s attendance at a Father's Day dinner during [[Typhoon Morakot]] in August 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2010/09/30/2003484166 |title=Chen Chu apologizes for absence |work=The Taipei Times   |date=15 September 2011 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?ID=201009290022&Type=aIPL |title=Cna English News |publisher=Focustaiwan.tw |date=29 September 2010 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}</ref>

Chen and the [[Kaohsiung City Government]] were sued by Lin Chi-mei, a fellow party member and local official from Benhe Village, in the aftermath of the flooding.
