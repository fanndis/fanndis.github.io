The '''African Union''' ('''AU''') is a [[continental union]] consisting of 55 [[Member states of the African Union|member states]] located on the continent of [[Africa]]. The AU was announced in the [[Sirte Declaration]] in [[Sirte District|Sirte]], [[Libya]], on 9 September 1999, calling for the establishment of the African Union. The bloc was founded on 26 May 2001 in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], and launched on 9 July 2002 in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]].<ref name="African Union 2002">{{cite web |url=http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Speeches_&_Statements/HE_Thabo_Mbiki/Launch%20of%20the%20African%20Union,%209%20July%202002.htm |title=Launch of the African Union, 9 July 2002: Address by the chairperson of the AU, President Thabo Mbeki |author=Thabo Mbeki |date=9 July 2002 |publisher=africa-union.org |location=ABSA Stadium, Durban, South Africa |accessdate=8 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503210549/http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Speeches_%26_Statements/HE_Thabo_Mbiki/Launch%20of%20the%20African%20Union%2C%209%20July%202002.htm |archivedate=3 May 2009}}</ref>

The intention of the AU was to replace the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), established on 25 May 1963 in Addis Ababa by 32 signatory governments; the OAU was disbanded on 9 July 2002. The most important decisions of the AU are made by the [[Assembly of the African Union]], a semi-annual meeting of the heads of state and government of its member states. The AU's secretariat, the [[African Union Commission]], is based in Addis Ababa. The largest city in the AU is [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]], while the [[List of urban agglomerations in Africa|largest urban agglomeration]] is [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].

The African Union has over 1.3 billion people and an area of around {{convert|29|e6km2|e6sqmi|sigfig=2|abbr=unit}} and includes popular world landmarks, including the [[Sahara desert]] and the [[Nile river]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Manboah-Rockson |first1=Joseph |title=Politics & the Struggle for Democracy in Ghana: An Introduction to Political Science |date=23 September 2016}}</ref> The primary working languages are [[Arabic]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], with [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]] being developed. Within the African Union, there are official bodies such as the [[Peace and Security Council]] and the [[Pan-African Parliament]].<ref>https://au.int/en/about/languages</ref>

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Overview ==

The African Union is made up of both political and administrative bodies. The highest decision-making organ is the [[Assembly of the African Union]], made up of all the heads of state or government of member states of the AU. The Assembly is chaired by [[Cyril Ramaphosa]], President of [[South Africa]]. The AU also has a representative body, the [[Pan-African Parliament]], which consists of 265 members elected by the national legislatures of the AU member states. Its president is [[Roger Nkodo Dang]].

Other political institutions of the AU include:
* the [[Executive Council of the African Union|Executive Council]], made up of [[foreign minister]]s, which prepares decisions for the Assembly;
* the [[Permanent Representatives' Committee of the African Union|Permanent Representatives Committee]], made up of the ambassadors to [[Addis Ababa]] of AU member states; and
* the [[Economic, Social, and Cultural Council]] (ECOSOCC), a civil society consultative body.

The [[African Union Commission|AU Commission]], the secretariat to the political structures, is chaired by [[Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma]] of South Africa. On 15 July 2012, Dlamini-Zuma won a tightly contested vote to become the first female head of the African Union Commission, replacing [[Jean Ping]] of [[Gabon]].

Other AU structures are hosted by different member states:
* the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] is based in [[Banjul]], [[the Gambia]]; and
* the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD) and [[APRM]] [[wikt:secretariat|Secretariats]] and the [[Pan-African Parliament]] are in [[Midrand]], South Africa.

The AU's first military intervention in a member state was the May 2003 deployment of a peacekeeping force of soldiers from South Africa, [[Ethiopia]], and [[Mozambique]] to [[Burundi]] to oversee the implementation of the various agreements. AU troops were also deployed in [[Sudan]] for peacekeeping during the [[Darfur conflict]], before the mission was handed over to the [[United Nations]] on 1 January 2008 [[UNAMID]]. The AU has also sent a peacekeeping mission to [[Somalia]], consisting of troops from [[Uganda]] and Burundi.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The AU has adopted a number of important new documents establishing norms at continental level, to supplement those already in force when it was created. These include the [[African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption]] (2003), the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance (2007), the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD) and its associated Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance.<ref>[http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Documents/Treaties/treaties.htm Africa-union.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604051527/http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Documents/Treaties/treaties.htm |date=4 June 2007 }}</ref>

== History ==
{{main|History of the African Union|History of Africa}}
The historical foundations of the African Union originated in the '''First Congress of Independence African States''', held in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]], from 15 to 22 April 1958. The conference aimed at forming the [[Africa Day]], to mark the liberation movement each year concerning the willingness of the African people to free themselves from foreign dictatorship, as well as subsequent attempts to unite Africa, including the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), which was established on 25 May 1963, and the [[African Economic Community]] in 1981.<ref>[https://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/history-africa-day-25-may] [[SAHO]] 15 May 2018.</ref>
Critics argued that the OAU in particular did little to protect the rights and liberties of African citizens from their own political leaders, often dubbing it the "Dictators' Club".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2115736.stm African Union replaces dictators' club], [[BBC]], 8 July 2002.</ref>

The idea of creating the AU was revived in the mid-1990s under the leadership of Libyan head of state [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]: the heads of state and government of the OAU issued the [[Sirte Declaration]] (named after Sirte, in Libya) on 9 September 1999, calling for the establishment of an African Union. The Declaration was followed by summits at [[Lomé]] in 2000, when the [[Constitutive Act of the African Union]] was adopted, and at [[Lusaka]] in 2001, when the plan for the implementation of the African Union was adopted. During the same period, the initiative for the establishment of the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD), was also established.

The African Union was launched in [[Durban]] on 9 July 2002, by its first chairperson, South African [[Thabo Mbeki]], at the first session of the Assembly of the African Union. The second session of the Assembly was in [[Maputo]] in 2003, and the third session in [[Addis Ababa]] on 6 July 2004.

Since 2010, the African Union eyes the establishment of a joint African [[space agency]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=David |title=Africa prepares to join the big boys in the space race |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/05/africa-space-programme-david-smith |newspaper=The Guardian |date=5 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=David |title=Sudanese president calls for African space agency |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/sudanese-president-african-space-agency |newspaper=The Guardian |date=6 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://phys.org/news/2012-09-ministers-african-space-agency.html |title=Africa eyes joint space agency |publisher=Phys.org |date=11 September 2012 |accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201008090886.html |title=AU to Establish African Space Agency |first1=Onyebuchi |last1=Ezigbo |first2=Lois |last2=Okpara |publisher=All Africa |date=9 August 2010 |accessdate=11 December 2015}}</ref>

[[Barack Obama]] was the first-ever sitting [[United States]] president to speak in front of the African Union in Addis Ababa, on 29 July 2015. With his speech, he encouraged the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the [[Outline of Africa|continent]], and lauded the progresses made in [[Education in Africa|education]], infrastructure and [[Economy of Africa|economy]]. But he also criticised a lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step down, discrimination against minorities (including [[LGBT]] people, religious groups and ethnicities) and corruption. He suggested an intensified [[democratisation]] and free trade, to significantly increase living quality for Africans.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Carol E. |title=Obama Becomes First U.S. President to Address African Union |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-becomes-first-u-s-president-to-address-african-union-1438090849 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Remarks by President Obama to the People of Africa |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/28/remarks-president-obama-people-africa |publisher=The White House |accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of the African Union}}

Member [[Sovereign state|states]] of the African Union cover almost the entirety of continental Africa, except for several territories held by [[Spain]] ([[Canary Islands]], [[Plazas de soberanía]]); [[France]] ([[Mayotte]], [[Réunion]], [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean]]); Portugal ([[Madeira]], [[Savage Islands]]); and the United Kingdom ([[Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha]]). Consequently, the geography of the African Union is wildly diverse, including the world's largest hot desert (the [[Sahara]]), huge jungles and [[savanna]]s, and the world's longest river (the [[Nile]]).

The AU presently has an area of {{convert|29922059|km2}}, with {{convert|24165|km}} of coastline. The vast majority of this area is on continental Africa, while the only significant territory off the mainland is the island of [[Madagascar]] ([[List of islands by area|the world's fourth-largest island]]), and the [[Sinai peninsula]] accounting for slightly less than 2% of the total.

The total population of the African Union {{as of|2017|lc=yes}} is estimated at more than 1.25 billion, with a growth rate of more than 2.5% p.a.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eloundou|first=Ngah Eric|date=December 2019|title=Private Sector Strengthening as Pillar of South Korea's Development Assistance toward Cameroon|url=https://think-asia.org/bitstream/handle/11540/11504/WEB%2019-26.pdf?sequence=1|journal=World Economic Brief|volume= 9., No. 26|pages=7}}</ref>

=== Languages ===
The official languages of the African Union are Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, [[Kiswahili]], and "any other African language".<ref>https://au.int/en/about/languages</ref> The primary working languages of the African Union are English and French. To a lesser extent Portuguese and Arabic are used. The [[Constitutive Act of the African Union|Constitutive Act]], for example, is written in English, French and Arabic, while the protocol amending the Constitutive Act is written in English, French and Portuguese. As of 2020, the AU website is available in its entirety in English, partially in French and minimally in Arabic.<ref>[https://au.int/en African Union]. Accessed 2020 April 27.</ref> Portuguese and Swahili versions were added as "coming soon" (''em breve'') in April 2019.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190406225637/https://au.int/kiswahili]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190407023106/https://au.int/portuguese]</ref>

== Politics ==
{{Politics of the African Union}}
The African Union has a number of official bodies:
; [[Pan-African Parliament]] (PAP): To become the highest legislative body of the African Union. The seat of the PAP is at [[Midrand]], [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. The Parliament is composed of 265&nbsp;elected representatives from all 55&nbsp;AU states, and intended to provide popular and civil-society participation in the processes of democratic governance. Its president is [[Roger Nkodo Dang]], of [[Cameroon]].
; [[Assembly of the African Union]]: Composed of heads of state and heads of government of AU states, the Assembly is currently the supreme governing body of the African Union. It is gradually devolving some of its decision-making powers to the Pan-African Parliament. It meets once a year and makes its decisions by consensus or by a two-thirds majority. The current [[Chairperson of the African Union|chair of the AU]] is [[South Africa]]n President [[Cyril Ramaphosa]].
; [[African Union Commission|African Union Commission (or Authority)]] : The secretariat of the African Union, composed of ten commissioners and supporting staff and headquartered in [[Addis Ababa]], Ethiopia. In a similar fashion to its [[European Union|European]] counterpart, the [[European Commission]], it is responsible for the administration and coordination of the AU's activities and meetings.
; [[Court of Justice of the African Union]]: The Constitutive Act provides for a Court of Justice to rule on disputes over interpretation of AU treaties. A protocol to set up this Court of Justice was adopted in 2003 and entered into force in 2009. It was, however, superseded by a protocol creating an [[African Court of Justice and Human Rights]], which will incorporate the already established [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (see below) and have two chambers: one for general legal matters and one for rulings on the human rights treaties.
; [[Executive Council of the African Union|Executive Council]]: Composed of ministers designated by the governments of member states. It decides on matters such as foreign trade, social security, food, agriculture and communications, is accountable to the Assembly, and prepares material for the Assembly to discuss and approve. It is chaired by Shawn Makuyana of Zimbabwe (2015– ).
; [[Permanent Representatives' Committee of the African Union|Permanent Representatives' Committee]]: Consisting of nominated permanent representatives of member states, the Committee prepares the work for the Executive Council, similar the role of the [[Committee of Permanent Representatives]] in the [[European Union]].
; [[Peace and Security Council]] (PSC): Proposed at the Lusaka Summit in 2001 and established in 2004 under a protocol to the Constitutive Act adopted by the AU Assembly in July 2002. The protocol defines the PSC as a collective security and early-warning arrangement to facilitate timely and effective response to conflict and crisis situations in Africa. Other responsibilities conferred to the PSC by the protocol include prevention, management and resolution of conflicts, post-conflict peace building and developing common defence policies. The PSC has fifteen members elected on a regional basis by the Assembly. Similar in intent and operation to the [[United Nations Security Council]].
; [[Economic, Social and Cultural Council]]:An advisory organ composed of professional and civic representatives, similar to the European [[Economic and Social Committee]]. The chair of ECOSOCC, elected in 2008, is Cameroonian lawyer [[Akere Muna]] of the Pan-African Lawyers Union (PALU).
; [[Specialised Technical Committees of the African Union|Specialised Technical Committees]]: Both the Abuja Treaty and the Constitutive Act provide for Specialised Technical Committees to be established made up of African ministers to advise the Assembly. In practice, they have never been set up. The ten proposed themes are: Rural Economy and Agricultural Matters; Monetary and Financial Affairs; Trade, Customs, and Immigration; Industry, Science and Technology; Energy, Natural Resources, and Environment; Transport, Communications, and Tourism; Health; Labour, and Social Affairs; Education, Culture, and Human Resources.
; Financial institutions:
* [[African Central Bank]] – [[Abuja]], Nigeria
* [[African Investment Bank]] – [[Tripoli]], Libya

; Human rights: The [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]], in existence since 1986, is established under the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (the African Charter) rather than the Constitutive Act of the African Union. It is the premier African human rights body, with responsibility for monitoring and promoting compliance with the African Charter. The [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]] was established in 2006 to supplement the work of the commission, following the entry into force of a protocol to the African Charter providing for its creation. It is planned that the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights will be merged with the Court of Justice of the African Union (see above).

{{see also|Member states of the African Union}}
All [[member states of the United Nations|UN member states]] based in Africa and on African waters are members of the AU, as is the [[International recognition of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|disputed]] [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR). [[Morocco]], which claims sovereignty over the SADR's territory, withdrew from the Organisation of African Unity, the AU's predecessor, in 1984 due to the admission of the SADR as a member. However, on 30 January 2017, the AU admitted Morocco as a member state.<ref name="worldbulletin">{{cite news |url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/todays-news/183967/morocco-rejoins-african-union |title=Morocco rejoins African Union |publisher=Worldbulletin |date=30 January 2017 |accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>

=== Governance ===
The principal topic for debate at the July 2007 AU summit held in [[Accra]], Ghana, was the creation of a Union Government,<ref>Decision on the Report of the 9th Extraordinary session of the executive council on the proposals for the Union Government, DOC.Assembly/AU/10 (VIII), Assembly/AU/Dec.156 (VIII).</ref> with the aim of moving towards a [[United States of Africa]]. A study on the [[Union Government of Africa|Union Government]] was adopted in late 2006,<ref>Study on an African Union Government: Towards a United States of Africa, 2006. See also, Decision on the Union Government, Doc. Assembly/AU/2(VII).</ref> and proposes various options for "completing" the African Union project. There are divisions among African states on the proposals, with some (notably [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]]) following a maximalist view leading to a common government with an AU army; and others (especially the southern African states) supporting rather a strengthening of the existing structures, with some reforms to deal with administrative and political challenges in making the AU Commission and other bodies truly effective.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/aumonitor/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608200746/http://www.pambazuka.org/aumonitor/|url-status=dead|title=Pambazuka.org|archivedate=8 June 2007}}</ref>

Following a heated debate in Accra, the [[Assembly of the African Union|Assembly of Heads of State and Government]] agreed in the form of a declaration to review the state of affairs of the AU with a view to determining its readiness towards a Union Government.<ref>Accra Declaration, Assembly of the Union at its 9th Ordinary session in Accra, Ghana, 1–3 July 2007.</ref> In particular, the Assembly agreed to:
* Accelerate the economic and political integration of the African continent, including the formation of a [[Union Government of Africa]];
* Conduct an audit of the institutions and organs of the AU; review the relationship between the AU and the RECs; find ways to strengthen the AU and elaborate a timeframe to establish a Union Government of Africa.

The declaration lastly noted the "importance of involving the African peoples, including Africans in the Diaspora, in the processes leading to the formation of the Union Government."

Following this decision, a panel of eminent persons was set up to conduct the "audit review". The review team began its work on 1 September 2007. The review was presented to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government at the January 2008 summit in Addis Ababa. No final decision was taken on the recommendations, however, and a committee of ten heads of state was appointed to consider the review and report back to the July 2008 summit to be held in Egypt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Conferences/2008/january/summit/docs/decisions/Assembly.Dec_171%20-%20192%20_X_%20-%20Addis_February_2008.pdf |title=Decision on the Report of the Executive Council on the Audit of the Union and the Report of the Ministerial Committee on the Union Government, Doc.

==== Role of African Union ====
{{Supranational African Bodies|align=right|size=500px}}
One of the key debates in relation to the achievement of greater continental integration is the relative priority that should be given to integration of the continent as a unit in itself or to integration of the sub-regions. The 1980 [[Lagos Plan of Action for the Development of Africa]] and the 1991 treaty to establish the African Economic Community (also referred to as the Abuja Treaty), proposed the creation of [[Regional Economic Communities]] (RECs) as the basis for African integration, with a timetable for regional and then continental integration to follow.<ref>See note on [https://web.archive.org/web/20040906140832/http://www.dfa.gov.za/docs/2003/au0815.htm The Role of the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) as the Building Blocks of the African Union] prepared by the South African Department of Foreign Affairs.</ref>

Currently, there are eight RECs recognised by the AU, each established under a separate regional treaty. They are:
* the [[Arab Maghreb Union]] (AMU)
* the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA)
* the [[Community of Sahel-Saharan States]] (CEN-SAD)
* the [[East African Community]] (EAC)
* the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] (ECCAS)
* the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS)
* the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] (IGAD)
* the [[Southern Africa Development Community]] (SADC)

The membership of many of the communities overlaps, and their rationalisation has been under discussion for several years—and formed the theme of the 2006 Banjul summit. At the July 2007 Accra summit the Assembly finally decided to adopt a Protocol on Relations between the African Union and the Regional Economic Communities.<ref>Decision on the Protocol on Relations between the African Union and the Regional Economic Communities (RECs), Assembly/AU/Dec.166 (IX).</ref> This protocol is intended to facilitate the harmonisation of policies and ensure compliance with the Abuja Treaty and Lagos Plan of Action time frames.

=== Selection of the chairperson ===
In 2006, the AU decided to create a Committee "to consider the implementation of a rotation system between the regions" in relation to the presidency. Controversy arose at the 2006 summit when Sudan announced its candidacy for the AU's chairmanship, as a representative of the East African region. Several member states refused to support Sudan because of tensions over [[Darfur]] (see also below). Sudan ultimately withdrew its candidacy and President [[Denis Sassou-Nguesso]] of the [[Republic of the Congo]] was elected to a one-year term. At the January 2007 summit, Sassou-Nguesso was replaced by President [[John Agyekum Kufuor]] of Ghana, despite another attempt by Sudan to gain the chair. The year 2007 was the 50th anniversary of Ghana's independence, a symbolic moment for the country to hold the chair of the AU—and to host the mid-year summit at which the proposed Union Government was also discussed. In January 2008, President [[Jakaya Kikwete]] of Tanzania took over as chair, representing the East African region and thus apparently ending Sudan's attempt to become chair—at least till the rotation returns to East Africa.<ref>See [http://www.afrimap.org/english/images/report/AU_People-DrivenNov07.pdf ''Towards a People-Driven African Union: Current Obstacles and New Opportunities''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216054523/http://www.afrimap.org/english/images/report/AU_People-DrivenNov07.pdf |date=16 February 2008 }}, AfriMAP, AFRODAD and Oxfam GB, Updated Edition November 2007, pp. 45–46, and [http://www.afrimap.org/english/images/report/AfriMAP-AU-Guide-EN.pdf ''Strengthening Popular Participation in the African Union: A Guide to AU Structures and Processes''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927110741/http://www.afrimap.org/english/images/report/AfriMAP-AU-Guide-EN.pdf |date=27 September 2013 }}, AfriMAP and Oxfam GB, 2010, pp. 8–9.</ref> The current chair is South Africa.

== Migration ==

Article 14 of the Protocol to the treaty establishing the African economic community relating to the free movement of persons, right of residence, and the right of establishment discusses the free movement of workers.<ref>[https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/36403-treaty-protocol_on_free_movement_of_persons_in_africa_e.pdf Protocol to the treaty establishing the african economic community relating to the free movement of persons, right of residence and right of establishment]</ref>

The African Union also has a Migration Policy Framework for Africa (MPFA).<ref>[https://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/64184.html Support to the African Union on migration and displacement]</ref>

By preventing [[Illegal immigration|irregular immigration]] of people, it is hoped that [[Illegal immigration#Problems faced by illegal immigrants|the threats associated with irregular immigration]] can also be avoided for these people.

Forced displacement of people and groups has also been an area of focus for the AU— over thirty states have ratified the [[Kampala Convention]], the only continental treaty focusing on internally displaced persons in the world.<ref>African Union. (n.d.) African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa.African Union. <nowiki>https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/36846-treaty-0039_-_kampala_convention_african_union_convention_for_the_protection_and_assistance_of_internally_displaced_persons_in_africa_e.pdf</nowiki></ref>

== Foreign relations ==
{{main|Foreign relations of the African Union}}
The individual member states of the African Union coordinate foreign policy through this agency, in addition to conducting their own [[international relations]] on a state-by-state basis. The AU represents the interests of African peoples at large in [[intergovernmental organisation]]s (IGOs); for instance, it is a [[United Nations General Assembly observers|permanent observer]] at the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. Both the African Union and the United Nations work in tandem to address issues of common concerns in various areas. The African Union Mission to the United Nations aspires to serve as a bridge between the two organizations.

Membership of the AU overlaps with other IGOs, and occasionally, these third-party organisations and the AU will coordinate on matters of public policy. The African Union maintains special diplomatic representation with the [[Ambassadors from the United States|United States]] and the [[European Union Special Representative|European Union]].

Beginning in 2016, the Union introduced continent-wide passports.<ref name="passport">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/07/01/the-opposite-of-brexit-african-union-launches-an-all-africa-passport/ |title=The Opposite of Brexit: African Union Launches an All-Africa Passport |last=Frugé |first=Anne |date=1 July 2016 |website=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

In 2017, [[Donald Trump]], [[President of the United States]], issued an executive order to ban citizens from seven countries with suspected links to terrorism from entering the United States. Three of these are African countries, and members of the AU. During the 28th African Union Summit in Ethiopia, African leaders criticised the ban<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2017/1/31/headlines/african_union_slams_trump_muslim_ban_invoking_legacy_of_transatlantic_slave_trade |title=African Union Slams Trump Muslim Ban, Invoking Legacy of Transatlantic Slave Trade |website=Democracy Now! |accessdate=1 February 2017}}</ref> as they expressed their growing concerns for the future of the African economy under President Trump's leadership and subsequent policies.

[[File:Emblem of the African Union.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Emblem of the African Union]]
The [[emblem of the African Union]] consists of a gold ribbon bearing small interlocking red rings, from which palm leaves shoot up around an outer gold circle and an inner green circle, within which is a gold representation of Africa. The red interlinked rings stand for African solidarity and the blood shed for the liberation of Africa; the palm leaves, for peace; the gold, for Africa's wealth and bright future; the green, for African hopes and aspirations. To symbolise African unity, the silhouette of Africa is drawn without internal borders.

The African Union adopted its new flag at its 14th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government taking place in Addis Ababa 2010. During the 8th African Union Summit which took place in Addis Ababa on 29 and 30 January 2007, the Heads of State and Government decided to launch a competition for the selection of a new flag for the Union. They prescribed a green background for the flag symbolising hope of Africa and stars to represent Member States.

Pursuant to this decision, the African Union Commission (AUC) organised a competition for the selection of a new flag for the African Union. The AUC received a total of 106 entries proposed by citizens of 19 African countries and 2 from the Diaspora. The proposals were then examined by a panel of experts put in place by the African Union Commission and selected from the five African regions for short listing according to the main directions given by the Heads of State and Government.

At the 13th Ordinary Session of the Assembly, the Heads of State and Government examined the report of the Panel and selected one among all the proposals. The flag is now part of the paraphernalia of the African Union and replaces the old one.

The old [[flag of the African Union]] bears a broad green horizontal stripe, a narrow band of gold, the emblem of the African Union at the centre of a broad white stripe, another narrow gold band and a final broad green stripe. Again, the green and gold symbolise Africa's hopes and aspirations as well as its wealth and bright future, and the white represents the purity of Africa's desire for friends throughout the world. The flag has led to the creation of the "[[national colours]]" of Africa of gold and green (sometimes together with white). These colours are visible in one way or another in the flags of many African nations. Together the colours green, gold, and red constitute the [[Pan-African colours]].

The African Union has adopted the anthem "[[Let Us All Unite and Celebrate Together]]".

== Celebration ==
[[Africa Day]], formerly African Freedom Day and African Liberation Day, is an annual commemoration regarding the founding of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), on 25 May 1963, and occurring on the same date of the month each year. Other celebrations include the following:
* The Fez Festival of World Sacred Music: a week-long celebration for harmony between cultures with dancing, Moroccan music, art exhibitions and films.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fès Festival of World Sacred Music |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/fez/events/fes-festival-of-world-sacred-music/a/poi-fes/1302608/355510 |website=Lonely Planet |accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref>

== Current issues ==
The AU faces many challenges, including health issues such as combating [[malaria]] and the [[AIDS/HIV]] epidemic; political issues such as confronting undemocratic regimes and mediating in the many civil wars; economic issues such as improving the [[Human Development Index|standard of living]] of millions of impoverished, uneducated Africans; ecological issues such as dealing with recurring famines, [[desertification]], and lack of ecological [[sustainability]]; as well as the [[international law|legal]] [[Legal status of Western Sahara|issues regarding Western Sahara]].

=== AIDS in Africa ===
The AU has been active in addressing the AIDS pandemic in Africa. In 2001, the AU established AIDS Watch Africa to coordinate and mobilise a continent-wide response.<ref>{{cite book |title=AIDS Watch Africa: An instrument for promoting AIDS responses in Africa |date=July 2004 |publisher=Discussion Paper presented by HE President Olusegun Obasanjo to Heads of State of the African Union |url=http://data.unaids.org/una-docs/awa_brochure_en.pdf}}</ref> [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], especially southern and eastern Africa, is the most affected area in the world. Though this region is home to only 6.2% of the world's population, it is also home to half of the world's population infected with HIV.<ref>http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/2016-prevention-gap-report_en.pdf</ref> While the measurement of HIV prevalence rates has proved methodologically challenging, more than 20% of the sexually active population of many countries of southern Africa may be infected, with South Africa, Botswana, [[Kenya]], Namibia, and [[Zimbabwe]] all expected to have a decrease in [[life expectancy]] by an average of 6.5 years. The pandemic has had massive implications for the economy of the continent, reducing economic growth rates by 2–4% across Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Dixon |first1=Simon |last2=McDonald |first2=Scott |last3=Roberts |first3=Jennifer |date=2002 |title=The Impact of HIV And AIDS on Africa's Economic Development |jstor=25227281 |journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal |volume=324 |issue=7331 |pages=232–234|doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7331.232 |pmid=11809650 |pmc=1122139 }}</ref>

In July 2007, the AU endorsed two new initiatives to combat the AIDS crisis, including a push to recruit, train and integrate 2 million community health workers into the continent's healthcare systems.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barton-Knott |first1=Sophie |title=African Union endorses major new initiatives to end AIDS |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2017/july/20170704_africanunion |accessdate=6 August 2017 |agency=UNAIDS |date=3 July 2017}}</ref>

In January 2012, the African Union Assembly requested that the African Union Commission would work out "a roadmap of shared responsibility to draw on African efforts for a viable health funding with support of traditional and emerging partners to address AIDS dependency response." Once created, the roadmap (as it is officially known) provided a group of solutions that would enhance the shared responsibility and global solidarity for [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], [[Tuberculosis|TB]], and [[Malaria]] responses in Africa by 2015. The roadmap was organised into three pillars: diversified financing, access to medicines, and enhanced health governance. The roadmap held stakeholders accountable for the realisation of these solutions between 2012 and 2015.

The first pillar, diversified financing, ensures that countries begin to develop a country specific financial sustainability plans with clear targets, and identify and maximise opportunities to diversify funding sources in order to increase the domestic resource allocation to AIDS and other diseases.

The second pillar, access to affordable and quality-assured medicines, tries to promote and facilitate investing in leading medicine hub manufacturers in Africa, accelerate and strengthen medicine regulatory harmonisation, and create legislation that would help to protect the knowledge of the researchers who develop these life-saving medicines.

The third pillar, enhanced leadership and governance, tries to invest in programs that support people and communities to prevent HIV and ensure that leadership at all levels is mobilised to implement the roadmap. There are several organisations that will ensure the smooth implementation of the roadmap, including [[New Partnership for Africa's Development|NEPAD]], [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], and several other UN partners.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Buse |first=Kent |date=January 2012 |title=Zeroing in on AIDS and Global Health Post-2015 |journal=Globalization and Health |volume=8 |pages=42–44 |doi=10.1186/1744-8603-8-42 |pmid=23199137 |pmc=3528638 }}</ref>

=== Corruption ===
Daniel Batidam, an anti-corruption advisory board member of the African Union, resigned after stating that the organisation had "multiple irregularities" and that "issues have come up over and over again" regarding corruption. The African Union quickly accepted his resignation, with Batidam saying that it was a sign that mismanagement towards corruption will "continue with business as usual".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.rfi.fr/africa/20180616-official-quits-au-anti-corruption-body-over-multiple-irregularities-african-union |title=Official quits AU anti-corruption body over 'multiple irregularities' |date=2018-06-23 |website=[[Radio France Internationale]] |language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-31}}</ref>

In a story published on 12 March 2020, AU staff alleged that Commission chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat was guilty of corruption and cronyism, as well as running of "a "mafia-style cartel" that operates with impunity.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2020-03-12-exclusive-a-mafia-style-cartel-is-running-the-african-union-claim-staff/|title=Exclusive: A 'mafia-style' cartel is running the African Union, claim staff|date=12 March 2020}}</ref> The allegations were contained in a memo leaked to the South African ''[[Mail & Guardian]]''. This followed [[sexual harassment]] allegations raised in late 2018.

=== Libya ===
In 2011, when the conflict in Libya began, the African Union was initially criticised for doing little to prevent the conflict's escalation. Additionally, the AU hesitated to take a side.  It was unclear whether the AU supported the Libyan regime or the rebels. This occurred as several human right violations were perpetrated against members of the Libyan regime. It was later realised that the AU's hesitation was due to its lack of capacity and its inability to engage in democratic reform.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last=Hove |first=Mediel |date=May 2017 |title=Post-Gaddafi Libya and the African Union: Challenges and the Road to Sustainable Peace. |journal=Journal of Asian & African Studies |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=271–286 |doi=10.1177/0021909615583366 |s2cid=147689749 }}</ref>

The AU attempted to mediate in the early stages of the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], forming an ''ad hoc'' committee of five presidents ([[Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] President [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]], [[Mali]]an President [[Amadou Toumani Touré]], [[Mauritania]]n President [[Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz]], [[South Africa]]n President [[Jacob Zuma]], and [[Uganda]]n President [[Yoweri Museveni]]) to broker a truce.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?sec=nation&file=/2011/3/21/nation/8313696 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321192206/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F3%2F21%2Fnation%2F8313696&sec=nation |url-status=dead |archivedate=21 March 2011 |work=The Star |title=African Union urges restraint on both sides |date=21 March 2011 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref> However, the beginning of the [[NATO]]-led [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention]] in March 2011 prevented the committee from traveling to [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]] to meet with Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/1129850/-/c3uoa3z/-/ |work=[[Daily Monitor]] |title=Kutesa, AU blocked from entering Libya |date=21 March 2011 |accessdate=21 March 2011 |first=Emmanuel |last=Mulondo}}</ref> As a body, the AU sharply dissented from the [[United Nations Security Council]]'s decision to create a [[no-fly zone]] over Libya,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sudantribune.com/NAfrican-Union-demands-end-to,38339 |title=African Union demands end to military strikes on Libya, skips Paris meeting |website=Sudan Tribune |date=19 March 2011 |accessdate=21 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321212338/http://www.sudantribune.com/NAfrican-Union-demands-end-to%2C38339 |archivedate=21 March 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> though a few member states, such as [[Botswana]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&aid=1909&dir=2011/March/Wednesday23 |date=23 March 2011 |accessdate=5 April 2011 |title=Khama supports no-fly zone on Libya |work=Mmegi |first=Baboki |last=Kayawe}}</ref> [[Gabon]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/03/201131720311168561.html |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=18 March 2011 |accessdate=18 March 2011 |title=UN authorises no-fly zone over Libya |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318102654/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/03/201131720311168561.html |archivedate=18 March 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Zambia]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.postzambia.com/post-read_article.php?articleId=19332 |work=The Post |date=27 March 2011 |accessdate=5 April 2011 |title=Rupiah backs action against Libya |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911072915/http://www.postzambia.com/post-read_article.php?articleId=19332 |archivedate=11 September 2012}}</ref> and others expressed support for [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|the resolution]].

In post-Gaddafi Libya, the African Union believes it still has an important responsibility to the country despite its failure to contribute to the conflict when it originated. Although the African Union is there to keep peace, it is not a long-term solution. The goal, as stated by the AU, is to establish a Libyan government that is sustainable to ensuring peace in Libya. To achieve some level of peace in Libya, the AU has to moderate peace talks which are aimed at achieving compromises and power sharing accommodations as well.<ref name=":2" />

{{See also|List of African Union military interventions}}

==== Togo ====
In response to the death of [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]], President of [[Togo]], on 5 February 2005, AU leaders described the appointment of his son, [[Faure Gnassingbé]], to the presidency to have been a [[Coup d'état|military coup]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4240485.stm |title=AU denounces Togo 'military coup' |publisher=BBC News |date=6 February 2005 |accessdate=10 July 2006}}</ref> Togo's constitution calls for the speaker of parliament to succeed the president in the event of his death. By law, the parliament speaker must call national elections to choose a new president within sixty days. The AU's protest forced Gnassingbé to hold elections. Under heavy allegations of election fraud, he was officially elected president on 4 May 2005.

==== Mauritania ====
On 3 August 2005, a coup in [[Mauritania]] led the African Union to suspend the country from all organisational activities. The Military Council that took control of Mauritania promised to hold elections within two years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} These were held in early 2007, the first time that the country had held elections that were generally agreed to be of an acceptable standard. Following the elections, Mauritania's membership of the AU was restored. However, on 6 August 2008, a fresh coup overthrew the government elected in 2007. The AU once again suspended Mauritania from the continental body.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/14105592 |title=All is rather easily forgiven |work=[[The Economist]] |date=23 July 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> The suspension was once again lifted in 2009 after the military junta agreed with the opposition to organise elections.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mauritania-sanctions/african-union-lifts-sanctions-on-mauritania-idUSTRE56021Z20090701 |title=African Union lifts sanctions on Mauritania |work=[[Reuters]] |date=1 July 2009 |accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref>

==== Mali ====
In March 2012, a military coup was staged in Mali, when an alliance of Touareg and Islamist forces conquered the north, resulting in a coming to power of the Islamists.

The AU decided to do this because of increasing tensions between al-Qaeda forces and the Mali army. There have been several rebel groups that are vying for control of parts of Mali. These rebel groups include the [[National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad|National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA)]], the National Front for the Liberation of Azawad (FLNA), Ganda Koy, Ganda Izo, [[Ansar al-Din Front|Ansar ad-Din]], and [[Al-Qaeda]] in the [[Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb|Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)]]. AU forces have been tasked with counterinsurgency missions in Mali as well as governing presidential elections to ensure as smooth a transition of power as possible.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Besancon |first1=Marie |last2=Dalzell |first2=Stephen |date=June 2014 |title=The Soldier and the Street: East African CIMIC in Somalia and Beyond. |journal=PRISM Security Studies Journal |volume=5 |pages=117–135 }}</ref>  In October 2020, the Peace and Security Council of the African Union lifted the suspension imposed on Mali from all activities of the pan-African body.<ref>{{Cite web|title=African Union lifts Mali’s suspension imposed in the wake of coup|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/9/african-union-lifts-malis-suspension-imposed-in-the-wake-of-coup|access-date=2020-10-09|website=www.aljazeera.com|language=en}}</ref>

== Regional conflicts and peacekeeping ==
One of the objectives of the AU is to "promote peace, security, and stability on the continent".<ref>Article 3(f) of the Constitutive Act.</ref> Among its principles is "Peaceful resolution of conflicts among Member States of the Union through such appropriate means as may be decided upon by the Assembly".<ref>Article 4(e) of the Constitutive Act.</ref> The primary body charged with implementing these objectives and principles is the Peace and Security Council. The PSC has the power, among other things, to authorise peace support missions, to impose sanctions in case of unconstitutional change of government, and to "take initiatives and action it deems appropriate" in response to potential or actual conflicts. The PSC is a decision-making body in its own right, and its decisions are binding on member states.

Article 4(h) of the Constitutive Act, repeated in article 4 of the Protocol to the Constitutive Act on the PSC, also recognises the right of the Union to intervene in a member state in circumstances of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. Any decision to intervene in a member state under article 4 of the Constitutive Act will be made by the Assembly on the recommendation of the PSC.

Since it first met in 2004, the PSC has been active in relation to the crises in Darfur, Comoros, Somalia, [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], Burundi, Côte d'Ivoire and other countries. It has adopted resolutions creating the AU peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Darfur, and imposing sanctions against persons undermining peace and security (such as travel bans and asset freezes against the leaders of the rebellion in Comoros). The council is in the process of overseeing the establishment of a "standby force" to serve as a permanent African peacekeeping force.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Institute for Security Studies, South Africa, March 2008. <!-- Is this supposed to be a ref?-->

The founding treaty of the AU also called for the establishment of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA), including the [[African Standby Force]] (ASF), which is to be deployed in emergencies. That means, in cases of genocide or other serious human-rights violations, an ASF mission can be launched even against the wishes of the government of the country concerned, as long as it is approved by the AU General Assembly. In the past AU peacekeeping missions, the concept was not yet applied, forces had to be mobilised from member states. The AU is planning on putting the concept into practise by 2015 at the earliest.<ref name=dandc.eu/>{{update inline|reason=Was this done? If not, how did the plans change?|date=July 2018}}

=== Darfur, Sudan ===
{{main|African Union Mission in Sudan}}
[[File:Eritrea - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|[[South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011]]]]
In response to the ongoing [[Darfur conflict]] in Sudan, the AU has deployed 7,000 peacekeepers, many from Rwanda and Nigeria, to [[Darfur]]. While a donor's conference in Addis Ababa in 2005 helped raise funds to sustain the peacekeepers through that year and into 2006, in July 2006 the AU said it would pull out at the end of September when its mandate expires.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5124608.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=AU Darfur mission 'to end soon' |date=28 June 2006 |accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> Critics of the AU peacekeepers, including Dr. [[Eric Reeves]], have said these forces are largely ineffective due to lack of funds, personnel, and expertise. Monitoring an area roughly the size of France has made it even more difficult to sustain an effective mission. In June 2006, the [[United States Congress]] appropriated US$173&nbsp;million for the AU force. Some, such as the [[Genocide Intervention Network]], have called for UN or [[NATO]] intervention to augment and/or replace the AU peacekeepers. The UN has considered deploying a force, though it would not likely enter the country until at least October 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2007/sc9089.doc.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815184454/http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sc9089.doc.htm|url-status=dead |archivedate=15 August 2007 |title=Security Council Authorises Deployment of United Nations-African Union 'Hybrid' Peace Operation in Bid To Resolve Darfur Conflict |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 November 2012}}</ref> The under-funded and badly equipped AU mission was set to expire on 31 December 2006 but was extended to 30 June 2007 and merged with the [[United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur]] in October 2007. In July 2009 the African Union ceased cooperation with the [[International Criminal Court]], refusing to recognise the international arrest warrant it had issued against Sudan's leader, [[Omar al-Bashir]], who was indicted in 2008 for [[war crime]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8134718.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=African move on Bashir dismissed |date=5 July 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref>

The AU struggled to have a strategic role in the independence talks and the reconciliation process of [[South Sudan]], due to overwhelming interests of African and non-African powers, its influence is still limited and not consistent.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sulaiman |first=Abubkar o. |author2=Agoha, Ifeanyi Chuckwu |title=South Sudan Negotiated Independence: A Critique of African Union's Role |journal=European Journal of Sustainable Development |date=1 October 2013 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=145–154 |doi=10.14207/ejsd.2013.v2n3p145|doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== Somalia ===
{{main|African Union Mission to Somalia}}
From the early 1990s up until 2000, [[Somalia]] was without a functioning central government. A peace agreement aimed at ending the [[Somali Civil War|civil war]] that broke out following the collapse of the [[Siad Barre]] regime was signed in 2006 after many years of peace talks. However, the new government was almost immediately threatened by further violence. In February 2007, the African Union (AU) and European Union (EU) worked together to establish the [[African Union Mission to Somalia (2007-present)|African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)]]. The purpose of AMISOM was to create a foundation that would hopefully provide aid to some of Somalia's most vulnerable and keep the peace in the region. They are tasked with everything from protecting federal institutions to facilitating humanitarian relief operations. Much of the AU's opposition comes from an Islamic extremist group named [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last=Anderson |first=Noel |date=2014 |title=Peacekeepers Fighting a Counterinsurgency Campaign: A Net Assessment of the African Union Mission in Somalia |journal=Studies in Conflict and Terrorism |volume=37 |issue=11 |pages=936–954 |doi=10.1080/1057610X.2014.952260 |s2cid=109822861 }}</ref> To temporarily shore up the government's military base, starting in March 2007, AU soldiers began arriving in [[Mogadishu]] as part of a peacekeeping force that was intended by the AU to eventually be 8,000 strong.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2115736.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=African Union replaces dictators' club |date=8 July 2002 |accessdate=23 April 2010 |first=Paul |last=Reynolds |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601025542/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2115736.stm |archivedate=1 June 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> Eritrea recalled its ambassadors to the African Union on 20 November 2009<ref>[http://www.afrol.com/articles/10577 Afro News] ''Eritrea breaks with African Union'', 20 November 2009.</ref> after the African Union called on the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions on them due to their alleged support of Somali Islamists attempting to topple the [[Transitional Federal Government]] of Somalia, the internationally recognised government of Somalia which holds Somalia's seat on the African Union.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8064939.stm "AU calls for sanctions on Eritrea"] BBC.co.uk 23 May 2009. Retrieved 23 May 2009</ref> On 22 December 2009, the United Nations Security Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1907|UNSCR 1907]], which imposed an arms embargo on Eritrea, travel bans on Eritrean leaders, and asset freezes on Eritrean officials. Eritrea strongly criticised the resolution. In January 2011, Eritrea reestablished their mission to the AU in Addis Ababa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201101210166.html |title=Eritrea: Nation Appoints AU Envoy in Ethiopia |date=20 January 2011 |accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref>

In the fall of 2011, AMISOM forces, along with Kenyan and Ethiopian forces, launched a set of offensive attacks on the [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]]. In these attacks, [[African Union Mission to Somalia (2007-present)|AMISOM]] forces were able to reclaim key cities including the Somali capital of [[Mogadishu]]. In September 2013, political scientist Ethan Bueno de Mesquita argued that with the help of [[African Union Mission to Somalia (2007-present)|AMISOM]] forces, they had made it "nearly impossible for [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] to hold territory even in its former strongholds in southern Somalia". Although much progress has been made towards peace in the region, it should still be noted that African Union forces' still get attacked regularly. Despite [[African Union Mission to Somalia (2007-present)|AMISOM]] being effective, it is vastly underfunded and many forces lack the resources required. Funding for humanitarian relief and the formation of armies tends to be vastly undercut.<ref name=":3" />
