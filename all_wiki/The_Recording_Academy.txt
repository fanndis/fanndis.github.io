'''The Recording Academy''' (formally the '''National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences'''; abbreviated '''NARAS''') is an American [[Learned society|learned academy]] of musicians, producers, recording engineers, and other musical professionals. It is famous for its [[Grammy Award]]s, which recognize achievements in the [[music industry]] of the [[United States]].

==History==
[[File:National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The Recording Academy's former headquarters in [[Santa Monica, California]].]]
The origin of the academy dates back to the beginning of the 1950s [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] project. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce asked the help of major recording industry executives in compiling a list of people in the music business who should be honored by Walk of Fame stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/|title=About Hollywood Star Walk|work=LA Times|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/history|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|publisher=Hollywood Walk of Fame|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref> The music committee, made up of these executives, compiled a list, but as they worked, they realized there were many more talented industry people who would not qualify to be recognized with a Hollywood Boulevard bronze star.

The founding committee members included Jesse Kaye, MGM Records; [[Lloyd Dunn]] and Richard Jones, Capitol Records; [[Sonny Burke]] and [[Milt Gabler]], Decca Records; [[Dennis Farnon]], RCA Records; and [[Axel Stordahl]], [[Paul Weston]], and [[Doris Day]] from Columbia Records.<ref>("Broadcasting" magazine 6-17-57.)</ref> This was the start of the academy and also of the [[Grammy Award]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NnRPAAAAIBAJ&pg=1440,1446700&dq=paul+weston&hl=en|title=Record Academy Plans TV Spectacular of Its Own|author=Thomas, Bob|date=April 8, 1959|publisher=Ocala Star-Banner|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ca9NAAAAIBAJ&pg=7065,1739274&dq=paul+weston&hl=en|title=Recording Stars Plan Eddie To Join Oscar And Emmy|date=August 9, 1957|publisher=The Deseret News|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aSBAAAAAIBAJ&pg=3612,4838071&dq=paul+weston+grammy&hl=en|title=Bronze Stars Begot Grammy|date=February 22, 1976|publisher=The Robesonian|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}</ref>

The Recording Academy was formally established in 1957.

The [[1st Annual Grammy Awards]] was held simultaneously in two locations on May 4, 1959 - Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills California, and Park Sheraton Hotel in New York City,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1959-may-238.html |title=Grammy Awards 1959 (May) |work=Grammy }}</ref> and 28 Grammys were awarded.
