'''Mammography''' (also called '''mastography''') is the process of using low-energy [[X-ray]]s (usually around 30 [[Peak kilovoltage|kVp]]) to examine the human [[breast]] for diagnosis and screening. The goal of mammography is the early detection of [[breast cancer]], typically through detection of characteristic masses or [[microcalcification]]s.

As with all X-rays, mammograms use doses of [[ionizing radiation]] to create images. These images are then analyzed for abnormal findings. It is usual to employ lower-energy X-rays, typically Mo (K-shell x-ray energies of 17.5 and 19.6 keV) and Rh (20.2 and 22.7 keV) than those used for [[radiography]] of [[bone]]s. [[Ultrasound]], [[ductography]], [[positron emission mammography]] (PEM), and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) are adjuncts to mammography. Ultrasound is typically used for further evaluation of masses found on mammography or palpable masses not seen on mammograms. Ductograms are still used in some institutions for evaluation of bloody nipple discharge when the mammogram is non-diagnostic. MRI can be useful for further evaluation of questionable findings, as well as for screening pre-surgical evaluation in patients with known breast cancer, in order to detect additional lesions that might change the surgical approach, for example, from breast-conserving [[lumpectomy]] to [[mastectomy]]. Other procedures being investigated include [[tomosynthesis]].

For the average woman, the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] recommends (2016) mammography every two years between the ages of 50 and 74, concluding that "the benefit of screening mammography outweighs the harms by at least a moderate amount from age 50 to 74 years and is greatest for women in their 60s".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/breast-cancer-screening1 |title=Breast Cancer: Screening |work=United States Preventive Services Task Force |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115075028/https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/breast-cancer-screening1 |archivedate=2016-01-15 }}</ref> The American College of Radiology and American Cancer Society recommend yearly screening mammography starting at age 40.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breast Cancer Early Detection|url=http://www.cancer.org/cancer/breastcancer/moreinformation/breastcancerearlydetection/breast-cancer-early-detection-acs-recs|website=cancer.org|accessdate=29 July 2014|date=2013-09-17|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810064747/http://www.cancer.org/cancer/breastcancer/moreinformation/breastcancerearlydetection/breast-cancer-early-detection-acs-recs|archivedate=10 August 2014}}</ref> The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (2012) and the European Cancer Observatory (2011) recommend mammography every 2 to 3 years between ages 50 and 69.<ref name=pmid22106103>{{cite journal |title=Recommendations on screening for breast cancer in average-risk women aged 40-74 years |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |date=21 November 2011 |volume=183 |issue=17 |pages=1991–2001 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.110334 |pmid=22106103 |pmc=3225421 |last1=Tonelli |first1=M. |last2=Connor Gorber |first2=S. |last3=Joffres |first3=M. |last4=Dickinson |first4=J. |last5=Singh |first5=H. |last6=Lewin |first6=G. |last7=Birtwhistle |first7=R. |last8=Fitzpatrick-Lewis |first8=D. |last9=Hodgson |first9=N. |last10=Ciliska |first10=D. |last11=Gauld |first11=M. |last12=Liu |first12=Y.

Mammography has a false-negative (missed cancer) rate of at least ten percent. This is partly due to [[optical density|dense]] tissue obscuring the cancer and the appearance of cancer on mammograms having a large overlap with the appearance of normal tissue. A meta-analysis review of programs in countries with organized screening found a 52% over-diagnosis rate.<ref name="urlwww.cochrane.dk"/>

==History==
As a medical procedure that induces ionizing radiation, the origin of mammography can be traced to the discovery of x-rays by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] in 1895.

In 1913, German surgeon [[Albert Salomon (surgeon)|Albert Salomon]] performed a mammography study on 3,000 [[mastectomies]], comparing X-rays of the breasts to the actual removed tissue, observing specifically [[microcalcification]]s.<ref name="Nass">{{cite book|author1=Sharyl J.

In 1930, American physician and radiologist [[Stafford L.

In the early 1950s, Uruguayan radiologist Raul Leborgne developed the breast compression technique to produce better quality images, and described the differences between benign and malign microcalcifications.{{cite journal | last1 = Gold | first1 = Richard H. | last2 = Bassett | first2 = Lawrence W. | last3 = Widoff | first3 = Bobbi E. | date = 1990 | title = Highlights from the history of mammography| journal = RadioGraphics | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 1111–1131 | doi = 10.1148/radiographics.10.6.2259767| pmid = 2259767 | doi-access = free }}

In the late 1950s, Robert Egan at the [[University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center]] combined a technique of low kVp with high mA and single emulsion films to devise a method of screening mammography for the first time. He published these results in 1959 in a paper, and subsequently in a 1964 book called ''Mammography''.<ref>Medich DC, Martel C. ''Medical Health Physics''. Health Physics Society 2006 Summer School.

Use of mammography as a screening technique spread clinically after a 1966 study demonstrating the impact of mammograms on mortality and treatment led by [[Philip Strax]]. This study, based in New York, was the first large-scale randomized controlled trial of mammography screening.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3138/cbmh.20.2.299 |pmid=14723235 |title="To See Today with the Eyes of Tomorrow": A History of Screening Mammography |journal=Canadian Bulletin of Medical History |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=299–321 |year=2003 |last1=Lerner |first1=Barron H |s2cid=2080082 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cced3563cb4f8dd0c40de332c75f3ae3ab68eccc }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1966.03100090065016 |pmid=5951878 |title=Evaluation of Periodic Breast Cancer Screening with Mammography |journal=JAMA |volume=195 |issue=9 |pages=731–8 |year=1966 |last1=Shapiro |first1=Sam |last2=Strax |first2=P |last3=Venet |first3=L }}</ref>

== Procedure ==
[[File:Blausen 0628 Mammogram.png|thumb|Illustration of a mammogram]]
[[File:BreastScreen Aotearoa.JPG|thumb|A mobile mammography unit in New Zealand]]
During the procedure, the breast is compressed using a dedicated mammography unit. Parallel-plate compression evens out the thickness of breast [[biological tissue|tissue]] to increase image quality by reducing the thickness of tissue that x-rays must penetrate, decreasing the amount of scattered radiation (scatter degrades image quality), reducing the required radiation dose, and holding the breast still (preventing [[motion blur]]). In screening mammography, both head-to-foot (craniocaudal, CC) view and angled side-view (mediolateral oblique, MLO) images of the breast are taken. Diagnostic mammography may include these and other views, including geometrically magnified and spot-compressed views of the particular area of concern. [[Deodorant]], [[talcum powder]] or [[lotion]] may show up on the X-ray as [[calcium]] spots, so women are discouraged from applying them on the day of their exam. There are two types of mammogram studies: screening mammograms and diagnostic mammograms. Screening mammograms, consisting of four standard X-ray images, are performed yearly on patients who presents with no symptoms. Diagnostic mammograms are reserved for patients with breast symptoms, changes, or abnormal findings seen on their screening mammograms. Diagnostic mammograms are also performed on patients with breast implants, breast reductions, and patients with personal and/or family histories of breast cancer.

Until some years ago, mammography was typically performed with screen-film cassettes. Today, mammography is undergoing transition to digital detectors, known as [[digital mammography]] or Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM). The first FFDM system was approved by the FDA in the U.S. in 2000. This progress is occurring some years later than in general radiology. This is due to several factors:
# The higher spatial resolution demands of mammography
# Significantly increased expense of the equipment
# Concern by the FDA that digital mammography equipment demonstrate that it is at least as good as screen-film mammography at detecting breast cancers without increasing dose or the number of women recalled for further evaluation.

As of March 1, 2010, 62% of facilities in the United States and its territories have at least one FFDM unit.<ref>[https://www.fda.gov/CDRH/MAMMOGRAPHY/scorecard-statistics.html Mammography Quality Scorecard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403172657/https://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mammography/scorecard-statistics.html |date=2007-04-03 }}, from the [[Food and Drug Administration]].

Photon-counting mammography was introduced commercially in 2003 and was shown to reduce the x-ray dose to the patient by approximately 40% compared to conventional methods while maintaining image quality at an equal or higher level.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Weigel|first1=Stefanie|last2=Berkemeyer|first2=Shoma|last3=Girnus|first3=Ralf|last4=Sommer|first4=Alexander|last5=Lenzen|first5=Horst|last6=Heindel|first6=Walter|date=May 2014|title=Digital Mammography Screening with Photon-counting Technique: Can a High Diagnostic Performance Be Realized at Low Mean Glandular Dose?|journal=Radiology|volume=271|issue=2|pages=345–355|doi=10.1148/radiol.13131181|pmid=24495234|issn=0033-8419|doi-access=free}}</ref> The technology was subsequently developed to enable [[Spectral imaging (radiography)|spectral imaging]]<ref name="Berglund 031003">{{Cite journal|last1=Berglund|first1=Johan|last2=Johansson|first2=Henrik|last3=Lundqvist|first3=Mats|last4=Cederström|first4=Björn|last5=Fredenberg|first5=Erik|date=2014-08-28|title=Energy weighting improves dose efficiency in clinical practice: implementation on a spectral photon-counting mammography system|journal=Journal of Medical Imaging|volume=1|issue=3|pages=031003|doi=10.1117/1.JMI.1.3.031003|issn=2329-4302|pmc=4478791|pmid=26158045}}</ref> with the possibility to further improve image quality,<ref name="Berglund 031003"/> to distinguish between different tissue types,<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fredenberg|first1=Erik|last2=Willsher|first2=Paula|last3=Moa|first3=Elin|last4=Dance|first4=David R|last5=Young|first5=Kenneth C|last6=Wallis|first6=Matthew G|date=2018-11-22|title=Measurement of breast-tissue x-ray attenuation by spectral imaging: fresh and fixed normal and malignant tissue|journal=Physics in Medicine & Biology|volume=63|issue=23|pages=235003|doi=10.1088/1361-6560/aaea83|pmid=30465547|issn=1361-6560|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/289601}}</ref> and to measure breast density.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Johansson|first1=Henrik|last2=von Tiedemann|first2=Miriam|last3=Erhard|first3=Klaus|last4=Heese|first4=Harald|last5=Ding|first5=Huanjun|last6=Molloi|first6=Sabee|last7=Fredenberg|first7=Erik|date=July 2017|title=Breast-density measurement using photon-counting spectral mammography|journal=Medical Physics|volume=44|issue=7|pages=3579–3593|doi=10.1002/mp.12279|pmid=28421611|doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Galactography ===
{{main|Galactography}}
A galactography (or breast ductography) is a type of mammography used to visualize the milk ducts. Prior to the mamography itself, a radiopaque substance is injected into the duct system. This test is indicated when nipple discharge exists.

==Scoring==
Mammogram results are often expressed in terms of the [[BI-RADS]] Assessment Category, often called a "BI-RADS score."  The categories range from 0 (Incomplete) to 6 (Known biopsy&nbsp;– proven malignancy). In the UK mammograms are scored on a scale from 1-5 (1 = normal, 2 = benign, 3 = indeterminate, 4 = suspicious of malignancy, 5 = malignant). Evidence suggests that accounting for genetic risk factors improve breast cancer risk prediction.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Jie|last2=Page|first2=David|last3=Nassif|first3=Houssam|last4=Shavlik|first4=Jude|last5=Peissig|first5=Peggy|last6=McCarty|first6=Catherine|last7=Onitilo|first7=Adedayo A|last8=Burnside|first8=Elizabeth|title=Genetic Variants Improve Breast Cancer Risk Prediction on Mammograms|journal=American Medical Informatics Association Symposium (AMIA)|date=2013|pages=876–885|pmid=24551380|volume=2013|pmc=3900221}}</ref>

=="Work-up" process==
In the past several years, the "work-up" process has become highly formalized. It generally consists of [[screening mammography]], diagnostic mammography, and [[biopsy]] when necessary, often performed via [[stereotactic biopsy|stereotactic core biopsy]] or [[ultrasound]]-guided core biopsy. After a screening mammogram, some women may have areas of concern which cannot be resolved with only the information available from the screening mammogram. They would then be called back for a "diagnostic mammogram". This phrase essentially means a problem-solving mammogram. During this session, the radiologist will be monitoring each of the additional films as they are taken by a radiographer. Depending on the nature of the finding, [[ultrasound]] may often be used as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lord |first1=S.J. |last2=Lei |first2=W. |last3=Craft |first3=P. |last4=Cawson |first4=J.N. |last5=Morris |first5=I. |last6=Walleser |first6=S. |last7=Griffiths |first7=A. |last8=Parker |first8=S. |last9=Houssami |first9=N. |title=A systematic review of the effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an addition to mammography and ultrasound in screening young women at high risk of breast cancer |journal=European Journal of Cancer |date=September 2007 |volume=43 |issue=13 |pages=1905–1917 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2007.06.007 |pmid=17681781 }}</ref>

Generally, the cause of the unusual appearance is found to be [[benign]]. If the cause cannot be determined to be benign with sufficient certainty, a biopsy will be recommended. The biopsy procedure will be used to obtain actual tissue from the site for the [[pathologist]] to examine microscopically to determine the precise cause of the abnormality. In the past, biopsies were most frequently done in surgery, under local or general [[anesthesia]]. The majority are now done with needles in conjunction with either ultrasound or mammographic guidance to be sure that the area of concern is the area that is biopsied. These [[core biopsies]] require only local anesthesia, similar to what would be given during a minor dental procedure.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=DAHLSTROM |first1=J.E. |last2=JAIN |first2=S. |last3=SUTTON |first3=T. |last4=SUTTON |first4=S. |title=Diagnostic accuracy of stereotactic core biopsy in a mammographic breast cancer screening programme |journal=Histopathology |date=30 October 2003 |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=421–427 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2559.1996.332376.x |pmid=8735717 |s2cid=7707679 }}</ref>

Keen and Keen indicated that repeated mammography starting at age fifty saves about 1.8 lives over 15 years for every 1,000 women screened.<ref>{{Cite journal  | url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/590535  | author=Nick Mulcahy  | date=April 2, 2009  | journal=Medscape  | title=Screening Mammography Benefits and Harms in Spotlight Again  | url-status=live  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413020916/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/590535  | archivedate=April 13, 2015  }}</ref> This result has to be seen against the adverse effects of errors in diagnosis, [[overtreatment|over-treatment]], and radiation exposure. The Cochrane analysis of screening indicates that it is "not clear whether screening does more good than harm". According to their analysis, 1 in 2,000 women will have her life prolonged by 10 years of screening, while 10 healthy women will undergo unnecessary breast cancer treatment. Additionally, 200 women will suffer from significant psychological stress due to false positive results.<ref name=":0" /> Newman points out that screening mammography does not reduce death overall, but causes significant harm by inflicting cancer scare and unnecessary surgical interventions.<ref>{{Cite book|  author=David H.

Often women are quite distressed to be called back for a diagnostic mammogram. Most of these recalls will be [[Type I and type II errors|false positive]] results. Of every 1,000 U.S. women who are screened, about 7% will be called back for a diagnostic session (although some studies estimate the number to be closer to 10% to 15%).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83865/|title=Wrap-Up Session|first1=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on New Approaches to Early Detection and Diagnosis of Breast|last1=Cancer|first2=Roger|last2=Herdman|first3=Larry|last3=Norton|date=4 May 2018|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|accessdate=4 May 2018|via=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504022034/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83865/|archivedate=4 May 2018}}</ref>  About 10 of these individuals will be referred for a biopsy; the remaining 60 cases are found to be of benign cause. Of the 10 referred for biopsy, about 3.5 will have cancer and 6.5 will not. Of the 3.5 who have cancer, about 2 will have an early stage cancer that will be  cured after treatment.

Mammography may also produce false negatives. Estimates of the numbers of cancers missed by mammography are usually around 20%.<ref>[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/mammograms Mammograms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217005145/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Detection/mammograms |date=2014-12-17 }}, National Cancer Institute</ref>  Reasons for not seeing the cancer include observer error, but more frequently it is because the cancer is hidden by other dense tissue in the breast, and even after retrospective review of the mammogram, the cancer cannot be seen. Furthermore, one form of breast cancer, lobular cancer, has a growth pattern that produces shadows on the mammogram that are indistinguishable from normal breast tissue.

=== Mortality ===
The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] states that the best quality evidence does not demonstrate a reduction in mortality or a reduction in mortality from all types of cancer from screening mammography.<ref name=":0" />

The Canadian Task Force found that for women ages 50 to 69, screening 720 women once every 2 to 3 years for 11 years would prevent 1 death from breast cancer. For women ages 40 to 49, 2,100 women would need to be screened at the same frequency and period to prevent a single death from breast cancer.<ref name=pmid22106103/>

Women whose breast cancer was detected by screening mammography before the appearance of a lump or other symptoms commonly assume that the mammogram "saved their lives".<ref name=Saved />  In practice, the vast majority of these women received no practical benefit from the mammogram. There are four categories of cancers found by mammography:

# Cancers that are so easily treated that a later detection would have produced the same rate of cure (women would have lived even without mammography).
# Cancers so aggressive that even early detection is too late to benefit the patient (women who die despite detection by mammography).
# Cancers that would have receded on their own or are so slow-growing that the woman would die of other causes before the cancer produced symptoms (mammography results in [[overdiagnosis|over-diagnosis]] and [[overtreatment|over-treatment]] of this class).
# A small number of breast cancers that are detected by screening mammography and whose treatment outcome improves as a result of earlier detection.

Only 3% to 13% of breast cancers detected by screening mammography will fall into this last category. Clinical trial data suggests that 1 woman per 1,000 healthy women screened over 10 years falls into this category.<ref name="well.blogs.nytimes.com">Parker-Pope, Tara.

A 2016 review for the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] found that mammography was associated with an 8%-33% decrease in breast cancer mortality in different age groups, but that this decrease was not [[statistically significant]] at the age groups of 39-49 and 70-74. The same review found that mammography significantly decreased the risk of advanced cancer among women aged 50 and older by 38%, but among those aged 39 to 49 the risk reduction was a non significant 2%.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nelson |first1=Heidi D. |last2=Fu |first2=Rochelle |last3=Cantor |first3=Amy |last4=Pappas |first4=Miranda |last5=Daeges |first5=Monica |last6=Humphrey |first6=Linda |title=Effectiveness of Breast Cancer Screening: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis to Update the 2009 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |date=12 January 2016 |volume=164 |issue=4 |pages=244–55 |doi=10.7326/M15-0969 |pmid=26756588 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== False positives ===
The goal of any screening procedure is to examine a large population of patients and find the small number most likely to have a serious condition. These patients are then referred for further, usually more invasive, testing. Thus a screening exam is not intended to be definitive; rather it is intended to have sufficient sensitivity to detect a useful proportion of cancers. The cost of higher sensitivity is a larger number of results that would be regarded as suspicious in patients without disease. This is true of mammography. The patients without disease who are called back for further testing from a screening session (about 7%) are sometimes referred to as "false positives". There is a trade-off between the number of patients with disease found and the much larger number of patients without disease that must be re-screened.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

Research shows<ref name="false-positive">{{cite journal |vauthors=Brewer NT, Salz T, Lillie SE |title=Systematic review: the long-term effects of false-positive mammograms |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=146 |issue=7 |pages=502–10 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17404352 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-146-7-200704030-00006|s2cid=22260624 }}</ref> that false-positive mammograms may affect women's well-being and behavior. Some women who receive false-positive results may be more likely to return for routine screening or perform breast self-examinations more frequently. However, some women who receive false-positive results become anxious, worried, and distressed about the possibility of having breast cancer, feelings that can last for many years.

False positives also mean greater expense, both for the individual and for the screening program. Since follow-up screening is typically much more expensive than initial screening, more false positives (that must receive follow-up) means that fewer women may be screened for a given amount of money. Thus as sensitivity increases, a screening program will cost more or be confined to screening a smaller number of women.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

=== Overdiagnosis ===
The central harm of mammographic breast cancer screening is [[overdiagnosis]]: the detection of abnormalities that meet the pathologic definition of cancer but will never progress to cause symptoms or death. Dr. [[H. Gilbert Welch]], a researcher at Dartmouth College, states that "screen-detected breast and prostate cancer survivors are more likely to have been over-diagnosed than actually helped by the test."<ref name="well.blogs.nytimes.com"/> Estimates of overdiagnosis associated with mammography have ranged from 1% to 54%.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Gelder|first1=R.|last2=Heijnsdijk|first2=E.

=== False negatives ===
Mammograms also have a rate of missed tumors, or "false negatives." Accurate data regarding the number of false negatives are very difficult to obtain because [[mastectomy|mastectomies]] cannot be performed on every woman who has had a mammogram to determine the false negative rate. Estimates of the false negative rate depend on close follow-up of a large number of patients for many years. This is difficult in practice because many women do not return for regular mammography making it impossible to know if they ever developed a cancer. In his book ''The Politics of Cancer'', Dr. Samuel S. Epstein claims that in women ages 40 to 49, 1 in 4 of cancer is missed at each mammography. Researchers have found that breast tissue is denser among younger women, making it difficult to detect tumors. For this reason, false negatives are twice as likely to occur in pre-menopausal mammograms (Prate). This is why the screening program in the UK does not start calling women for screening mammograms until age 50.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The importance of these missed cancers is not clear, particularly if the woman is getting yearly mammograms. Research on a closely related situation has shown that small cancers that are not acted upon immediately, but are observed over periods of several years, will have good outcomes. A group of 3,184 women had mammograms that were formally classified as "probably benign." This classification is for patients who are not clearly normal but have some area of minor concern. This results not in the patient being biopsied, but rather in having early follow up mammography every 6 months for 3 years to determine whether there has been any change in status. Of these 3,184 women, 17 (0.5%) did have cancers. Most importantly, when the diagnosis was finally made, they were all still stage 0 or 1, the earliest stages. Five years after treatment, none of these 17 women had evidence of re-occurrence. Thus, small early cancers, even though not acted on immediately, were still reliably curable.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sickles |first1=E A |title=Periodic mammographic follow-up of probably benign lesions: results in 3,184 consecutive cases. |journal=Radiology |date=May 1991 |volume=179 |issue=2 |pages=463–468 |doi=10.1148/radiology.179.2.2014293 |pmid=2014293 }}</ref>

=== Other risks ===
The radiation exposure associated with mammography is a potential risk of screening, which appears to be greater in younger women. The largest study of radiation risk from mammography concluded that for women 40 years of age and older, the risk of radiation-induced breast cancer was minuscule, particularly compared with the potential benefit of mammographic screening, with a benefit-to-risk ratio of 48.5 lives saved for each life lost due to radiation exposure.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Feig S, Hendrick R |title=Radiation risk from screening mammography of women aged 40–49 years |journal=J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr |volume=1997 |issue= 22|pages=119–24 |year= 1997|pmid=9709287|doi=10.1093/jncimono/1997.22.119 }}</ref> In contrast epidemiologic studies show a high incidence of breast cancer following mammography screening.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Corcos D, Bleyer A |title=Epidemiologic Signatures in Cancer |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=382 |issue= 1|pages=96–97 |year= 2020|pmid=31875513|doi=10.1056/NEJMc1914747 }}</ref>
Organizations such as the [[National Cancer Institute]] and United States Preventive Task Force do not take such risks into account when formulating screening guidelines.<ref name="USPTF" />

The majority of health experts agree that the risk of breast cancer for asymptomatic women under 35 is not high enough to warrant the risk of radiation exposure. For this reason, and because the radiation sensitivity of the breast in women under 35 is possibly greater than in older women, most radiologists will not perform screening mammography on women under 40. However, if there is a significant risk of cancer in a particular patient (BRCA positive, positive family history, palpable mass), mammography may still be important. Often, the radiologist will try to avoid mammography by using ultrasound or MRI imaging.

While screening between ages 40 and 50 is still controversial, the preponderance of the evidence indicates that there is some small benefit in terms of early detection. Currently, the [[American Cancer Society]], the [[American College of Radiology]], and the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] encourage annual mammograms beginning at age 40.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.org/healthy/findcancerearly/cancerscreeningguidelines/american-cancer-society-guidelines-for-the-early-detection-of-cancer |title=Cancer Screening Guidelines &#124; Detecting Cancer Early |accessdate=2011-06-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613085624/http://www.cancer.org/Healthy/FindCancerEarly/CancerScreeningGuidelines/american-cancer-society-guidelines-for-the-early-detection-of-cancer |archivedate=2011-06-13 }} Retrieved 2013-09-11.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jacr.2009.09.022 |pmid=20129267 |title=Breast Cancer Screening with Imaging: Recommendations from the Society of Breast Imaging and the ACR on the Use of Mammography, Breast MRI, Breast Ultrasound, and Other Technologies for the Detection of Clinically Occult Breast Cancer |journal=Journal of the American College of Radiology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=18–27 |year=2010 |last1=Lee |first1=Carol H |last2=Dershaw |first2=D.

===Pain===
The mammography procedure can be painful. Reported pain rates range from 6-76%, with 23-95% experiencing pain or discomfort.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-146-7-200704030-00008 |pmid=17404354 |title=Screening Mammography in Women 40 to 49 Years of Age: A Systematic Review for the American College of Physicians |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=146 |issue=7 |pages=516–26 |year=2007 |last1=Armstrong |first1=Katrina |last2=Moye |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Williams |first3=Sankey |last4=Berlin |first4=Jesse A |last5=Reynolds |first5=Eileen E |doi-access=free }}</ref> Experiencing pain is a significant predictor in women not re-attending screening.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.breast.2013.03.003 |pmid=23541681 |title=The effect of mammography pain on repeat participation in breast cancer screening: A systematic review |journal=The Breast |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=389–94 |year=2013 |last1=Whelehan |first1=Patsy |last2=Evans |first2=Andy |last3=Wells |first3=Mary |last4=MacGillivray |first4=Steve }}</ref> There are few proven interventions to reduce pain in mammography, but evidence suggests that giving women information about the mammography procedure prior to it taking place may reduce the pain and discomfort experienced.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Dawn|last2=Livingstone|first2=Vicki|last3=Herbison|first3=G Peter|date=2008-01-23|title=Interventions for relieving the pain and discomfort of screening mammography|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=1|pages=CD002942|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd002942.pub2|pmid=18254010|issn=1465-1858}}</ref> Furthermore, research has found that standardised compression levels can help to reduce patients' pain while still allowing for optimal diagnostic images to be produced.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Serwan|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Matthews|first2=Donna|last3=Davies|first3=Josephine|last4=Chau|first4=Minh|title=Mammographic compression practices of force- and pressure-standardisation protocol: A scoping review|journal=Journal of Medical Radiation Sciences|year=2020|language=en|volume=n/a|issue=n/a|pages=233–242|doi=10.1002/jmrs.400|pmid=32420700|pmc=7476195|issn=2051-3909|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Regulation==
Mammography facilities in the United States and its territories (including military bases) are subject to the [[Mammography Quality Standards Act]] (MQSA). The act requires annual inspections and accreditation every 3 years through an FDA-approved body. Facilities found deficient during the inspection or accreditation process can be barred from performing mammograms until corrective action has been verified or, in extreme cases, can be required to notify past patients that their exams were sub-standard and should not be relied upon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/MammographyQualityStandardsActandProgram/FacilityCertificationandInspection/ucm246568.htm|title=Facility Certification and Inspection (MQSA) - Mammography Safety Notifications|last=Health|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|website=www.fda.gov|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>

At this time, MQSA applies only to traditional mammography and not to related scans, such as [[breast ultrasound]], stereotactic breast biopsy, or breast MRI.

Many states in the US require a notification to be given to women with dense breasts to inform them that mammography is less accurate if breast tissue density is high. In 2019, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] proposed a rule that would require doctors inform these women that they may need other imaging tests in addition to mammograms.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Angelica LaVito|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/27/fda-proposes-rule-to-notify-women-about-cancer-risks-of-breast-density.html|title=FDA proposes rule to notify women with dense breasts about increased cancer risk and imprecise mammograms|publisher=CNBC|date=2019-03-27|access-date=2019-03-27}}</ref>
