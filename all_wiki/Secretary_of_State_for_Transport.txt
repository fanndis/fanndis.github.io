The '''Secretary of State for Transport''', also referred to as the '''Transport Secretary''', is the member of the cabinet responsible for the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Department for Transport]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/secretary-of-state-for-transport|title=Secretary of State for Transport - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> The office used to be called the Minister of Transport and has been merged with the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department for the Environment]] at various times.

The Secretary of State is supported by a small team of junior Ministers. Each Minister is a [[Member of Parliament]] from either the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] or the [[House of Lords]]. The number of Ministers supporting the Secretary of State for Transport varies from time to time, but is usually about 3. The titles given to these Ministers also vary. Currently the positions are held by one Minister of State for Transport and two [[Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State]] for Transport.

During the tenure of different governments the title of Minister of/for Transport has been used to refer to the Secretary of State for Transport, one or more of the junior Ministers or even both the Secretary of State and the junior Ministers at the same time.

From 2003 until June 2007 the role of Secretary of State for Transport was combined with the role of [[Secretary of State for Scotland]].  This arrangement changed on 28 June 2007, when in the appointment of his first Cabinet, Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] assigned the responsibilities of [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] to [[Des Browne]], his [[Secretary of State for Defence]].

The names provided in the sections below are those who have served in a position equivalent to the Secretary of State for Transport.

==Minister of (War) Transport and Minister of Civil Aviation (1941–1953)==
The Ministry of Transport absorbed the [[Minister of Shipping|Ministry of Shipping]] and was renamed the Ministry of War Transport in 1941, but resumed its previous name at the end of the war.

The Ministry of Civil Aviation was created by [[Winston Churchill]] in 1944 to look at peaceful ways of using [[aircraft]] and to find something for the aircraft factories to do after the war. The new Conservative government in 1951 appointed the same minister to both Transport and Civil Aviation, finally amalgamating the ministries on 1 October 1953.

From 1997 to 2001, the Ministers of State with responsibility for Transport were:

* [[Gavin Strang]] (''3 May 1997&nbsp;– 27 July 1998'')
* [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]] (''27 July 1998&nbsp;– 17 May 1999'')
* [[Helen Liddell]] (''17 May 1999&nbsp;– 29 July 1999'')
* [[Gus Macdonald, Baron Macdonald of Tradeston|Lord Macdonald of Tradeston]] (''29 July 1999&nbsp;– 8 June 2001'')

John Reid attended cabinet meetings, but was not formally a member of the cabinet whereas Gavin Strang was given a seat in the cabinet when he held the position.

==Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (2001–2002)==
The [[Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions]] was widely considered unwieldy and so was broken up, with the Transport functions now combined with Local Government and the Regions in the '''DTLR''' ('''Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions'''). Critics argued from the outset that this was a mistake and that a post of Secretary of State for Transport was needed in its own right.

After Byers' resignation, such a division was made, with the portfolios of Local Government and the Regions transferred to the [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]].

During the lifetime of DTLGR, [[John Spellar]] served as Minister of State for Transport with a right to attend Cabinet.
