'''Open Britain''' is British pro-[[European Union]] campaign group set up in the [[Aftermath of the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|aftermath of the 2016 European Union referendum]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Dallison | first = Paul |url=https://www.politico.eu/article/remain-mps-launch-pro-europe-campaign-group/ |title=Remain MPs launch pro-Europe campaign group |work=[[Politico Europe|Politico]] |date=2 September 2016 |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref>

Following the referendum, the official remain group in the [[2016 EU referendum]], [[Britain Stronger in Europe]], changed its name on 25 August 2016 to Open Britain.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Straw |first1=Will |title=Special Resolution - Change of company name on 25 August 2016 |url=https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/document-api-images-live.ch.gov.uk/docs/SQSgtXb9yfLsDdIBfkbMNpXE4JxkIkgrH9zkPWyXAJ4/application-pdf?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAWRGBDBV3PFRBBA4C%2F20190910%2Feu-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20190910T121144Z&X-Amz-Expires=60&X-Amz-Security-Token=AgoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEAQaCWV1LXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIB%2F%2FR4vL616ev89N%2Bw6IJ02Sgckh1fqtfbjE6ygHAI63AiAXOzESIHGTqtqm0ZQTyheGPJLGheBapfTK8d60D3itaSrjAwi9%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDQ0OTIyOTAzMjgyMiIM2SeMcZsnvNltM5jxKrcDLjtW2S3dgxXLhtU7yYzDfMRhaB2%2BUPFIrtVCUPJU2lbPe92if0jv8BwbRJb%2FpAF3FZ%2BycD03fmRLYJwD1054jlAO3%2Fexy30cbGo%2B9djSgzUsyLLhp4oNnq9mTSPC6H6OaeU%2BLqblzmJuMJm3hhWQvraeyJt8GJ5Dq4heHixkhBd8jJV4w%2BkhLgXr7tf4pNDK8mhc%2Bm3SzTYZOk%2FocedCpXZXSXcDW0Zl21B5t7gMNqIA9GFawo3qyF5JmLX2PnbEgVCXfZ%2FlaWn90SMDWbllGixC%2BGPQLyHdagw1jBe8YVJpGydOvkd6x0ERoAK87QJiURvq8PRtsoeoRbXPbXwBFjQGwLBMKfLOWiNIgh83xyjWnrohlW1umnr9Tjm0sJ6TIcgsrX8bQztQtGsLQAVm2mdNKMkMUJCDqtW1KxkyZ0prNUMaZFegS16ZyLEx7lIBXUpTWgu9ynW63sT7tCpYJCwjvFpuFz1Rgj0wCqk0adPvoSy4flv8NRXkFJqWeyHmoJ%2B%2FPMFOOZwXqHY%2Ffm3ebY%2Flu4j8wyN2%2B8esJeQbNycgvy5Mrim%2BlmChNvHcGw%2BNxpuytwrsTTDyjt7rBTq1AePKpAfJIJuAaV0t%2FkCSXxgXq5%2BPsUEIkWxrmxI3026frd1wziQma6Yhccq9nBVtc1O%2BH7F3viLrH8pSgFyZkNZK5a0hg%2F3utYAxniHwt0AqBuRZd3GBbJTayypgdxWj%2BOt%2FrQqtseAj2Eyt19w%2FdnPt6h63BfB240LYy1pjkTPwFuxJmwSiKtgPKBpJh9ZNQVcAZ3e6spC3Bb2pIQQbxFsKxZCy1%2FynIBjRQVym7ewhPOaDVgM%3D&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=afcd4fcbbd7ebe84de36645654262a707f7625394850e043642339c991943a05 |website=Companies House |publisher=Companies House}}</ref>

Open Britain defines itself as campaigning for the United Kingdom to be open and inclusive, open for business, open to trade and investment, open to talent and hard work, open to Europe and to the world.<ref>{{cite web|author=Open Britain |url=http://www.open-britain.co.uk/about | website = open-britain.co.uk |title=About |publisher=Open Britain |date= |accessdate=13 December 2016}}</ref> It is originally campaigned for Britain to remain in the Single Market as part of the outcome of the [[Brexit negotiations]].<ref>{{cite news | last1 = Asthana | first1 = Anushka | last2 = Mason | first2 = Rowena | last3 = Syal | first3 = Rajeev | author-link1=Anushka Asthana |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/11/government-adviser-leaving-eu-customs-union-uk-25bn |title=Brexit adviser: leaving EU customs union will cost UK £25bn a year |work=The Guardian |date=11 October 2016 |accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref>

In October 2016, Open Britain launched a 'Write to Remain' letter-writing campaign directed at [[Theresa May]] asking her to guarantee the right of EU nationals to stay in the UK.<ref>{{cite news | last = Mason | first = Rowena |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/13/letter-campaign-theresa-may-eu-nationals-stay-in-uk |title=Letter-writing campaign urges Theresa May to let EU nationals stay in UK |work=The Guardian |date=13 October 2016 | accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref>

The individuals involved in the campaign group include former Ministers [[Pat McFadden (British politician)|Pat McFadden]] (Labour) and [[Norman Lamb]] (Liberal Democrat).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.open-britain.co.uk/new_campaign_group_open_britain_launches_to_fight_for_best_possible_eu_deal_for_britain|title=New campaign group, Open Britain, launches to fight for best possible EU deal for Britain|last=Open Britain | website = open-britain.co.uk|publisher=Open Britain|accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref> Conservatives [[Anna Soubry]], [[Nicky Morgan]], and [[Dominic Grieve]] cut their ties with Open Britain in April 2017 after it began to campaign against the re-election of anti-EU members of parliament, mostly Conservatives.<ref>{{cite news | last = Walker | first = Peter |title=Pro-EU Tories quit Open Britain over plans to oust Brexit-backing MPs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/25/pro-eu-tories-quit-open-britain-over-plans-to-oust-brexit-backing-mps |work=The Guardian |date=25 April 2017 |accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref>

Open Britain continues to campaign in collaboration with other major pro-European campaign groups such as Britain for Europe and [[European Movement UK]]. It launched and promotes [[People's Vote]] in April 2018 to campaign for a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|second referendum]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Porritt | first = Richard | title = Campaign launched to push for People's Vote | url = http://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/second-brexit-vote-campaign-launch-1-5476745 | work = [[The New European]] | date = 15 April 2018 | access-date = 17 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Launch of the new national People's Vote campaign | url = https://www.open-britain.co.uk/launch_of_the_new_national_people_s_vote_campaign | website = open-britain.co.uk | publisher = Open Britain | date = 15 April 2018 | access-date = 17 April 2018}}</ref>

In October 2019, shortly before the [[2019 UK General Election]], CEO James McGrory was forced out<ref name="gu2019"/> of [[People's Vote]] and Open Britain. Almost all the directors resigned. As the lead organisation behind the People's Vote campaign, this led to a [[People's Vote#October 2019 internal power struggle|major staff walk out]] in protest of Roland Rudd, the Chairperson's, actions.
