On June 30, 2020, with Mayor [[Muriel Bowser]]'s support, the NAACP announced its plans to move its headquarters from [[Baltimore]] to [[Washington, D.C.]]. NPR reported, "Muriel Bowser, the mayor of the District of Columbia, said the plan is to have the NAACP move to the city's historic U Street corridor." <ref>{{cite web |last1=Booker |first1=Brakkton |title=NAACP Plans To Move Its Headquarters From Baltimore To Washington, D.C. |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/30/885191089/naacp-plans-to-move-its-headquarters-from-baltimore-to-washington-d-c |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2 July 2020}}</ref>

===2020 Election===
In an interview with [[GQ Magazine]], Derrick Johnson expressed that the [[NAACP]] does not endorse Presidential candidates. "We don't endorse candidates or political parties. I'm going to embrace the need to increase voter turnout in the Black community, and then we allow the voters to make a determination of the options on the ballot, which of the two they're going to select," Johnson stated. <ref name="Bassett">{{cite web |last1=Bassett |first1=Laura |title=NAACP President Derrick Johnson Knows How to Fight Voter Suppression |url=https://www.gq.com/story/naacp-president-derrick-johnson-interview |website=GQ |accessdate=2 July 2020}}</ref> On June 10, 2020, the NAACP hosted a virtual town hall with former Vice President [[Joe Biden]]. <ref>{{cite web |title=NAACP TO HOST VIRTUAL TOWN HALL ABOUT SYSTEMIC RACISM FEATURING FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND CONGRESSWOMAN MARCIA FUDGE |url=https://www.naacp.org/latest/naacp-host-virtual-town-hall-systemic-racism-featuring-former-vice-president-joe-biden-congresswoman-marcia-fudge/ |publisher=NAACP |accessdate=2 July 2020}}</ref>

When asked about Trump, President Johnson expressed, "In my lifetime, I have not seen a single president as bad as Trump. I vacillate between whether or not it's malicious intent, incompetence, a very narrow, myopic view of the world, narcissism... We have not in my lifetime seen anyone so narrowly focused on personal ego and not what's in the best interest of public citizens. It's one thing to disagree about public policy and tax policy; it's a completely different thing to destroy the faith in our system the way he does." <ref name="Bassett" />

===Jimmy Fallon Interview===
On June 1, 2020, President Johnson joined [[Jimmy Fallon]] on the ''[[Tonight Show]]''. In the interview, Fallon apologized for wearing blackface in an old ''[[SNL]]'' sketch that had resurfaced. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Christopher |title=Jimmy Fallon Repeats SNL Blackface Apology in Larger Conversation About Race |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/06/jimmy-fallon-blackface-apology |work=Vanity Fair |accessdate=30 June 2020}}</ref> Jimmy Fallon expressed, "the silence is the biggest crime that white guys like me and the rest of us are doing, staying silent. We need to say something, we need to keep saying something, and we need to say 'That's not OK' more than one day on Twitter." In response to the apology, Derrick Johnson noted “that was powerful, but most importantly, that's about courage ... In this time of many people searching for answers and the display of anger and hopelessness and wandering, more people need to speak about where they are with a really authentic voice. And I think you did that with the opening monologue.” <ref>{{cite web |last1=NBC |title=Jimmy Addresses Past Mistakes and Speaks to NAACP President Derrick Johnson |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMpbwODjNTA&feature=emb_title |via=YouTube |publisher=NBC |accessdate=30 June 2020}}</ref> Derrick Johnson later added, "we are all born flawed, but flawed is part of the journey we are on to get to perfection.

===DACA===
On June 18, 2020, in [[Trump v. NAACP (DACA)|''Trump v. NAACP'']], the Supreme Court of the United States blocked the Trump administration's effort to dismantle [[DACA]] in "[[Donald J. Trump]], President of the United States, et al., Petitioners v. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, et al." The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the [[NAACP]] in a 5-to-4 decision.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Barnes |first1=Robert |title=Supreme Court blocks Trump’s bid to end DACA, a win for undocumented ‘dreamers’ |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-rules-against-trump-administration-attempt-to-end-daca-a-win-for-undocumented-immigrants-brought-to-us-as-children/2020/06/18/4f0b6c74-b163-11ea-8758-bfd1d045525a_story.html |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=24 June 2020}}</ref> President Trump later wrote in a tweet that this was a "shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Trump |first1=Donald J. |title=These horrible & politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives.

GQ Magazine reported that under Derrick Johnson's leadership, "the nation's foremost and oldest civil rights organization landed a huge win in its Supreme Court case — Trump v. NAACP — that prevents Donald Trump's administration from rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for young immigrants." Johnson added, "It's a huge victory for us." <ref>{{cite web |last1=Bassett |first1=Laura |title=NAACP President Derrick Johnson Knows How to Fight Voter Suppression |url=https://www.gq.com/story/naacp-president-derrick-johnson-interview |website=GQ |accessdate=25 June 2020}}</ref>

On June 25, 2020, The Hill reported that the [[NAACP]] "successfully convinced the Supreme Court to rule against Trump. Its decision to defend DACA, Johnson said, came in part because of the organization's traditional role of being a voice for Black communities, including immigrants. “DACA, oftentimes people seem to think of the Latinx community, when in fact it was far more reaching than that,” Johnson said." <ref>{{cite web |last1=Bernal |first1=Rafael |title=The Hill interview: NAACP president puts Trump DACA actions alongside Dred Scott decision |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/news/504428-the-hill-interview-naacp-president-puts-trump-daca-actions-alongside-dred-scott |website=The Hill |accessdate=25 June 2020}}</ref>

[[File:DACA protest at Trump Tower (52703).jpg|thumb|left|Protesters outside Trump Tower in New York City, September 5, 2017]]
President Derrick Johnson, expressed in a statement: "For far too long, the voices of the undocumented DACA recipients from the African Diaspora were silenced. There is no democratic dream for anyone if we don't allow our DREAMers to fully participate. This is a tremendous victory for America. Today's Supreme Court ruling in our favor is an incredible victory for justice, in the spirit of the NAACP's groundbreaking Supreme Court victory in Brown v Board of Education. We know the value of affirmative litigation to ensure that the nation lives up to its ideals. This ruling exemplifies the ways in which ensuring the Civil Rights for our community pushes the needle on social justice for the benefit of all. Although today represents an exciting victory, we won a battle; the war wages on. Trump could rescind DACA again tomorrow if he wants. The fight truly ends when Congress passes a permanent solution that protects DREAMERS, and the NAACP will continue that fight along with its allies."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Derrick |title=NAACP APPLAUDS SUPREME COURT VICTORY IN NAACP V.

The Washington Post also reported that "Trump has often seemed ambivalent about DACA recipients — lauding them at some points and declaring they are “no angels” at others — but his administration has tried since September 2017 to end the program. It was implemented as an executive action by Obama in 2012 after a failed congressional attempt at comprehensive immigration reform." <ref>{{cite web |last1=Barnes |first1=Robert |title=Supreme Court blocks Trump’s bid to end DACA, a win for undocumented ‘dreamers’ |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-rules-against-trump-administration-attempt-to-end-daca-a-win-for-undocumented-immigrants-brought-to-us-as-children/2020/06/18/4f0b6c74-b163-11ea-8758-bfd1d045525a_story.html |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=25 June 2020}}</ref>

Justice Roberts wrote in an opinion that "the dispute before the court is not whether DHS may rescind DACA. All parties agree that it may. The dispute is instead primarily about the procedure the agency followed in doing so..."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Supreme Court of the United States |title=DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ET AL. v.

===Facebook: Stop Hate For Profit campaign===
In the summer of 2020, the NAACP launched the Stop Hate For Profit campaign, targeting [[Facebook]] and its founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]] for refusing to take down [[hate speech]] on the platform. In a live interview on [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[Morning Joe]]'', Johnson called Facebook "one of the biggest threats to democracy'. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Manskar |first1=Noah |title=NAACP chief calls Facebook ‘one of the biggest threats to democracy’ |url=https://nypost.com/2020/06/25/naacp-ceo-derrick-johnson-calls-facebook-a-threat-to-democracy/ |website=The New York post |publisher=The New York post |accessdate=1 July 2020}}</ref> It was later revealed that The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, [[Prince Harry]] and [[Meghan Markle]] were working with the NAACP in this campaign.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perry |first1=Simon |title=Meghan Markle & Prince Harry 'Working' with Civil Rights Groups to Support Facebook Boycott: Source |url=https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-prince-harry-support-working-with-civil-rights-groups-facebook-boycott/ |website=People |accessdate=1 July 2020}}</ref> President Johnson praised the couple for embodying “the kind of leadership that meets the moment." He added, "The NAACP deeply value your unwavering support to Stop Hate For Profit." <ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Derrick |title=Tweet |url=https://twitter.com/derricknaacp/status/1277331608673099776 |via=Twitter |accessdate=1 July 2020}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Forbes]]'', Johnson said, "the flagrant disregard Facebook has shown in putting a stop to the hateful lies and dangerous propaganda on its platform exemplifies a lack of concern for the greater public and nullifies any notion of corporate social responsibility coming from its leadership. Any brand that claims to have the best interest of its consumers in mind should undoubtedly join the #StopHateForProfit campaign. Facebook is ultimately damaging its credibility with the American public, and any company that wants to avoid doing the same should send a message that we will no longer accept disinformation during this critical time." <ref>{{cite web |title=Facebook Ad Boycott Campaign ‘Stop Hate For Profit’ Gathers Momentum And Scale: Inside The Movement For Change |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/afdhelaziz/2020/06/24/facebook-ad-boycott-campaign-stop-hate-for-profit-gathers-momentum-and-scale-inside-the-movement-for-change/ |website=Forbes |accessdate=1 July 2020}}</ref>

===CBS Studios Partnership===

On July 15, 2020, The NAACP and President Johnson announced a multi-year deal with CBS Television Studios. [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] announced that "Under the deal, the two organizations will work together to develop and produce scripted, unscripted, and documentary projects for linear and streaming platforms. The partnership will be aimed toward elevating a diverse range of voices as well as increasing the visibility of Black artists. The deal includes a commitment to develop projects for CBS Television Network but also allows the selling of show to outside entities." <ref>{{cite web |last1=Otterson |first1=Joe |title=NAACP, CBS Television Studios Set Multi-Year Content Partnership |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/naacp-cbs-television-studios-deal-1234706656/ |website=Variety |publisher=Variety |accessdate=15 July 2020}}</ref>

[[The Hollywood Reporter]] added, "Included in the deal is a commitment to not only develop for CBS-owned platforms but also to third-party platforms, meaning CBS/NAACP would own content that would be supplied to other buyers like Netflix and Amazon." <ref>{{cite web |title=CBS, NAACP Ink Sprawling Content Partnership Deal |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cbs-naacp-ink-sprawling-content-partnership-deal-1303262 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=15 July 2020}}</ref>

"In this moment of national awakening, the time has never been better to further tell stories of the African American experience,” said NAACP CEO Derrick Johnson.

The Chief Justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court appointed Derrick Johnson to the Mississippi Access to Justice Commission. The Governor of Mississippi also appointed Johnson as the Chair of the Governor's Commission for Recovery, Rebuilding, and Renewal after his humanitarian work following [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name=NAACPbio />

=== ''The Guardian'' ===
On June 3, 2020, ''The Guardian'' published an op-ed by Johnson titled "In America, Black deaths are not a flaw in the system. They are the system."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Derrick |title=In America, Black deaths are not a flaw in the system. They are the system |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/america-black-deaths-racism |website=The Guardian |accessdate=1 July 2020}}</ref> In the op-ed, Johnson wrote, "we are 3.5 times more likely to die of Covid-19 than white people. Although Black people are only 13% of the population, we constitute about twice that percentage of US coronavirus cases. This is not because the coronavirus seeks us by color; it is because we suffer from an underlying condition. Say its name. The condition is racism. It is manifest in a lack of opportunity; in economic inequality; in the absence of healthcare; in a biased criminal justice system and mass incarceration; in schools that scream for care; in a denial of truth; and more." This op-ed was quoted the following day by [[Wolf Blitzer]] on [[CNN]], in a special coverage of [[George Floyd]]'s memorial.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blitzer |first1=Wolf |title=NAACP president: Protesting is crucial, but so is electing accountable officials |url=https://www.facebook.com/CNNReplay/videos/naacp-president-protesting-is-crucial-but-so-is-electing-accountable-officials/909017019510279/ |via=Facebook |publisher=CNN |accessdate=1 July 2020}}</ref>

== COVID-19 ==
In a piece on [[CNN]], Derrick Johnson wrote, "it wasn't a surprise to many of us that the shortage of hospitals and health care providers serving our communities, combined with the biased assumptions that lead doctors to undertreat Black people's pain and heart attacks, would result in African Americans finding it harder to get tested and treated. And we knew that as soon as the pandemic became racialized, many Americans would no longer be willing to make sacrifices in order to address a crisis that suddenly seemed to be not about "us" but about "them."" He added, "Lives and livelihoods are at stake, most acutely in Black and brown communities -- but so is our democracy. We are seeing high levels of scarcity, with extreme unemployment numbers, while the nation's chief executive uses his bully pulpit to sow division and demonize otherness. With the elections approaching, our country could sink to a level of tribalism that leads to violence." <ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Derrick |title=When it comes to Covid-19, another case of white flight |url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/11/opinions/covid-19-case-white-flight-johnson/index.html |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2 July 2020}}</ref>
