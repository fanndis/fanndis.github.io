'''Individual action on climate change''' can include personal choices in many areas, such as diet, means of long- and short-distance travel, household energy use, consumption of goods and services, and family size. Individuals can also engage in local and political [[advocacy]] around issues of [[climate change]].

Depending on if these planes are domestic or flying international, these planes carry anywhere from 90 to 544 passengers per flight. Compared to longer flight routes, shorter flights actually produce larger amounts of greenhouse gas emissions per passenger they carry. Airplanes contribute to damaging our environment since airplanes cause greater air pollution as they release carbon dioxide along with nitrogen oxides, which is an atmospheric pollutant. These gases lead to the formation of the greenhouse gas called ozone. Ozone has a greater concentration level in higher altitudes than being on the ground. The carbon in the fuel which jets burn gets released into the atmosphere forming carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere also causes ocean acidification, the decrease in the pH of the oceans. Ocean acidification causes a shift in the water's pH balance from seawater to acidic water. While it may seem that one plane ride won’t cause much damage, over time the carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides do contribute to climate change.

===Surface transport===

[[File:Amish kick scooters.jpg|thumb|Amish kick scooters]]
*[[Walking]] and [[running]] are among the least environmentally harmful modes of transportation.
*[[Cycling]] follows walking and running as having a low impact on the environment.
*[[Public transport]] such as [[electric bus]]es, [[Rapid transit|metro]] and [[Electric locomotive|electric trains]] generally emit less greenhouse gases than cars per passenger.
*[[Electric kick scooter]]s could also be a low-impact form of transportation, with emerging startups such as [[Bird (company)|Bird]] and [[Lime (transportation company)|Lime]] providing shared scooters allowing for last-mile transportation. However, their short lifespan caused by rough usage and vandalism could mean additional resources spent on replacement units. Some models provide higher range (35+ miles, 56+ km) and speed (40+ mph, 64+ km/h), which can be used in areas with poor public transportation infrastructure where cars and motorcycles would have previously been the only option.
* [[Car]]s: Using an [[electric car]] instead of a gasoline or diesel car helps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

Meats such as beef have a higher climate impact since cows release methane, a greenhouse gas that is more harmful than carbon dioxide.

Eating meat not only affects the climate but also affects our bodies. Studies show that eating meats such as red meats have many links to current diseases and illnesses. A research team led by Dr. Frank Hu of the Harvard School of Public Health, studied over 37,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (beginning in 1986) and over 83,000 women from the Nurses' Health Study (beginning in 1980).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Publishing|first=Harvard Health|title=Cutting red meat-for a longer life|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/cutting-red-meat-for-a-longer-life|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Harvard Health}}</ref> All the participants were free of cardiovascular disease and cancer at the start of the study. Dr. Hu states that there is evidence that shows a link between a high intake of red and processed meats and a higher risk for heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and premature death. The results state that almost 24,000 participants died during the study, including about 5,900 from cardiovascular disease and about 9,500 from cancer.

===Low energy products and consumption=== 
Labels, such as [[Energy Star]] in the US, can be seen on many household appliances, home electronics, office equipment, heating and cooling equipment, windows, residential light fixtures, and other products. Energy star is a program in the U.S. that promotes energy efficiency. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. The Department of Energy runs the program, and they produce energy-efficient products, which help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to data found by energysage.com<ref>{{Cite web|title=2019 Most Energy Efficient Appliances {{!}} EnergySage|url=https://www.energysage.com/energy-efficiency/costs-benefits/energy-star-rebates/#:~:text=ENERGY%20STAR%20appliances%20can%20significantly%20reduce%20your%20electric%20bills&text=The%20average%20home%20appliance%20lasts,a%20non-energy%20efficient%20equivalent.|access-date=2020-11-24|website=www.energysage.com}}</ref> Energy star appliance lasts for 10 to 20 years and uses anywhere from 10 to 50 percent less energy each year than a non-energy efficient equivalent.

[[Carbon emission label]]s describe the [[carbon dioxide]] emissions created as a by-product of manufacturing, transporting, or disposing of a [[consumer product]].

Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) "present transparent, verified and comparable information about the life-cycle environmental impact of products."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.environdec.com/|title=The International EPD® System|website=www.environdec.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref>

These labels may help consumers choose lower energy products.

===Landscape and gardens=== 
[[File:People&#039;s Climate March 2017 in Washington DC 196.jpg|thumb]]
Protecting forests and planting new trees contributes to the absorption of carbon dioxide from the air. There are many opportunities to plant trees in the yard, along roads, in parks, and in public gardens. In addition, some charities plant fast-growing trees—for as little as $US0.10 per tree—to help people in tropical developing countries restore the productivity of their lands.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://trees.org/aboutus/ |title=Our Story |publisher=Trees for the Future |accessdate=2019-09-25 }}</ref>

[[Turfgrass]] [[lawn]]s can contribute to climate change through the impacts of [[fertilizer]]s, [[herbicide]]s, [[irrigation]], and gas-powered [[lawnmower]]s and other tools; depending on how lawns are managed, the impact of emissions from maintenance and chemicals may outweigh any carbon sequestration from the lawn.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Bright-Green/2010/0122/Lawns-may-contribute-to-global-warming|title=Lawns may contribute to global warming|date=2010-01-22|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2019-10-20|issn=0882-7729}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Townsend‐Small|first1=Amy|last2=Czimczik|first2=Claudia I.|date=2010|title=Carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions in urban turf|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=n/a|doi=10.1029/2009GL041675|bibcode=2010GeoRL..37.2707T|issn=1944-8007|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/16h20797}}</ref> Reducing irrigation, reducing chemical use, planting native plants or bushes, and using hand tools can all reduce the climate impact of lawns.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/climate/climate-newsletter-lawns.html|title=One Thing You Can Do: Reduce Your Lawn|last1=Fountain|first1=Henry|date=2019-04-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-20|last2=Kaysen|first2=Ronda|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Producing raw materials such as clothing has a big impact on our environment. Factors such as spinning material into fibers, dyeing, and weaving require massive amounts of water and chemicals. Some materials such as cotton require pesticides like Aldicarb for growing as cotton. “The World Resources Institute estimates that the so-called “fast fashion” industry annually releases about 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming” <ref>{{Cite web|last=Copyright © 2020|title=Lessening the Harmful Environmental Effects of the Clothing Industry|url=https://www.planetaid.org/blog/lessening-the-harmful-effects-of-the-clothing-industry|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Planet Aid, Inc.|language=en}}</ref>  Not only is making clothes hurtful to the environment but getting rid of clothes also hurts the environment. According to PlanetAid.Org “Clothing is the second-largest pollution source in the world”. Some clothing is donated and recycled, meanwhile, the rest of the waste heads to landfills where they release “greenhouse gases and leach toxins and dyes into the surrounding soil and water”.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Copyright © 2020|title=Lessening the Harmful Environmental Effects of the Clothing Industry|url=https://www.planetaid.org/blog/lessening-the-harmful-effects-of-the-clothing-industry|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Planet Aid, Inc.|language=en}}</ref>

The choice of stove may vary depending on location.

[[Electric stoves]] are preferable to [[Gas stove|natural gas]] in locations where the electric grid has a high proportion of renewable energy, such as California.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-gas-stove-climate-change-southern-california-20190404-story.html|title=California's next frontier in fighting climate change: your kitchen stove|last=Roth|first=Sammy|date=2019-04-04|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref>

==Individual purchase of carbon offsets==
{{Main|Carbon offset}}

The principle of [[carbon offset]] is this: one decides that they don't want to be responsible for accelerating climate change, and they've already made efforts to reduce their [[carbon dioxide emissions]], so they decide to pay someone else to further reduce their net emissions by planting trees or by taking up low-carbon technologies. Every unit of carbon that is absorbed by trees—or not emitted due to your funding of renewable energy deployment—offsets the emissions from their fossil fuel use. In many cases, funding of renewable energy, energy efficiency, or [[tree planting]] — particularly in developing nations—can be a relatively cheap way of making an individual "carbon neutral".{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

==Political advocacy==

However, sudden removal of a subsidy by governments not trusted to redirect it,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/14/heres-why-raising-gas-prices-leads-violent-protests-like-ecuadors/|title=Here's why raising gas prices leads to violent protests like Ecuador's|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014131609/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/14/heres-why-raising-gas-prices-leads-violent-protests-like-ecuadors/|archive-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> or without providing good alternatives for individuals, can lead to civil unrest. An example of this took place in 2019, when Ecuador removed its gasoline and diesel subsidies without providing enough [[electric bus]]es to maintain service. The result was overnight fuel price hikes of 25-75 percent. The corresponding fare hikes for Ecuador's existing gas and diesel powered bus fleet were met with violent protests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theecologist.org/2019/oct/21/how-not-eliminate-fossil-fuel-subsidies|title=How not to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies|website=The Ecologist|language=en|access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>

==Lack of information, or misleading information on individual actions==
{{See also|Climate change policy of the United States#Trump_administration}}As recently as 2008, "about 40% of adults worldwide ... [had] never heard of climate change, or nearly 2 billion people."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/news-events/what-world-thinks-about-climate-change/|title=Nearly 2 Billion Adults Have Never Heard of Climate Change|last=Leiserowitz|first=Anthony|date=2015-10-29|website=Yale Program on Climate Change Communication|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>

=== Focus on climate change effects, without information on taking action ===
[[Climate change education (CCE)|Climate change education]], which became mandatory in [[Italy]] in 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/italy-makes-climate-change-education-compulsory/story?id=66817133|title=Italy makes climate change education compulsory|last=Bentson|first=Clark|date=November 7, 2019|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> is completely absent in some countries, or fails to provide information on action that individuals can take.

In some countries [[media coverage of global warming]] reports the effects of climate change, such as extreme weather, but makes no mention of either individual or government actions which can be taken.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/life/2019/09/12/climate-change-triggers-extreme-weather-in-turkey|title=Climate change triggers extreme weather in Turkey|website=DailySabah|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref>

=== Presenting plant based diets as strict vegetarianism ===
The suggestion that eating a plant based diet requires a person to become strictly vegetarian is also misinformation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/myths-and-misconceptions-about-plant-based-diets|title=Myths and Misconceptions About Plant-Based Diets|date=2018-08-18|website=National Kidney Foundation|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> A plant-based diet focuses on consuming foods primarily from plants. Some examples of food consumed in a plant-based diet are fruits and vegetables, nuts, seeds, oils, whole grains, legumes, and beans. People may consider it as being vegan or vegetarian but it is very different. Vegan diets eliminate all animal products, meanwhile, plant-based diets do not completely eliminate animal products, but they encourage the focus on eating mostly plants. One downside of having a plant-based diet is that Plant-based diets carry some risk of inadequate protein and mineral intake. But, according to the Physicians Committee,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Plant-Based Diets|url=https://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/plant-based-diets|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine|language=en}}</ref> you can choose the right plant-based food to overcome the risk “Plant-based foods are full of fiber, rich in vitamins and minerals, free of cholesterol, and low in calories and saturated fat”.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Plant-Based Diets|url=https://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/plant-based-diets|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine|language=en}}</ref> 

== Impact of individual actions ==
[[File:People&#039;s Climate March 2017 in Washington DC 199.jpg|thumb]]Media focus on low impact rather than high impact behaviors is concerning for scientists. The most impactful actions for individuals may differ significantly from the popular advice for "greening" one's lifestyle. For instance, popular suggestions for individual actions include:
* Replacing a typical car with a hybrid (0.52 tonnes);
* washing clothes in cold water (0.25 tonnes);
* recycling (0.21 tonnes);
* upgrading light bulbs (0.10 tonnes); etc. -- all lower impact behaviors.

Researchers have stated that "Our recommended high-impact actions:

* one fewer child,
* living car-free
* avoiding one trans-Atlantic flight
* eating a plant-based diet

are more effective than many more commonly discussed options. For example, eating a plant-based diet saves eight times more emissions than upgrading light bulbs."<ref name="Wynes-Nicholas-2017" /><ref name="Perkins2017" /> Public discourse on reducing one's carbon footprint overwhelmingly focuses on low-impact behaviors, and as of 2017, the mention of high-impact individual behaviors to impact climate was almost non-existent in [[mainstream media]], government publications, [[K-12]] school textbooks, etc.<ref name="Wynes-Nicholas-2017" /><ref name="Perkins2017" />

However, advocate [[Bill McKibben]] is joined by many others in his opinion that "no effort is too small" with regards to climate change.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-02-07|title=Solutions|url=https://www.drawdown.org/solutions|access-date=2019-12-09|website=Drawdown|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Wilkinson|first=Katharine|date=April 23, 2018|title=Solving Climate Change: A Blueprint.
