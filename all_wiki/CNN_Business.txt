'''CNN Business''' (formerly '''CNN Money''') is a financial news and information website, operated by [[CNN]]. The website was originally formed as a joint venture between [[CNN.com]] and [[Time Warner]]'s ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' and ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' magazines. Since the spin-off of Time Warner's publishing assets as [[Time Inc.]] (and their subsequent sale to [[Meredith Corporation]]), the site has since operated as an affiliate of [[CNN]].

==History==
CNN Money launched in 2001, replacing [[CNNfn]]'s website. Time Warner had also announced an intention to relaunch the CNNfn television network under the CNN Money moniker, but those plans were apparently scrapped.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/2001/01/31/cnnfn-to-become-cnn-money | title=CNNfn To Become CNN MONEY | publisher=[[Time Warner]] | date=January 31, 2001}}</ref>

Prior to June 2014, the website was operated as a joint venture between [[CNN]] and two Time Warner-published business magazines; ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' and ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]''. In June 2014, Time Warner's publishing assets were spun-out as [[Time Inc.]]; as a result, all three properties launched separate web presences, and CNN Money introduced a new logo that removed the [[wordmark]] of ''Money'' magazine from its branding. With the re-launch, CNN head [[Jeff Zucker]] also promised increased synergies between the website and the CNN channel, such as branded segments and the re-branding of CNN's weekly financial show ''Your Money'' as ''CNNMoney''.<ref name="tvn-newcnnmoney">{{cite web|author=Merrill Knox|title=New CNNMoney 'Will Be More Connected to CNN Television Than Ever'|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/new-cnnmoney-will-be-more-connected-to-cnn-television-than-ever_b227101|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605230425/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/new-cnnmoney-will-be-more-connected-to-cnn-television-than-ever_b227101|archive-date=5 June 2014|access-date=July 22, 2014|website=TVNewser}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Emma | last=Bazilian | title=Fortune, Money Spinoff From CNNMoney.com - Both titles finally have stand-alone sites |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/press/fortune-money-spin-cnnmoneycom-158054 | work=[[Adweek]] | date=June 1, 2014}}</ref>

In October 2018, CNN re-launched the vertical as '''CNN Business'''; the new brand is focused on "digital transformation of business, and how it is disrupting every corner of the global economy". The relaunch came alongside the opening of a new San Francisco bureau. As with CNNMoney, it will be supported by branded segments on CNN television, as well as streaming content.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/cnn-business-launches-today-with-a-new-san-francisco-bureau/379820 | title=CNN Business Launches Today With a New San Francisco Bureau | first=A.J. | last=Katz | work=[[Adweek]] | date=October 4, 2018}}</ref>
