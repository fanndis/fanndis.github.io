===Emergency Preparedness and Climate Resilience===
One of the core pillars of the Clara Lionel Foundation's work is to transform the way the world responds to natural disasters. Through its work supporting relief efforts for Hurricane Harvey, Irma, and Maria, which together caused $380 billion in damages and killed thousands of people, to Cyclone Idai in East Africa, CLF saw the challenges with traditional current disaster response systems work. "In 2018, the foundation decided to begin testing a different approach, focused on proactively making buildings, infrastructure, and social systems stronger so that they would be most likely to survive future storms, preventing damage rather than repeatedly rebuilding. In a first pilot, the foundation is working with International Planned Parenthood Federation and Engineers Without Borders to make reproductive health clinics in the Caribbean more resilient to disasters."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Peters |first1=Adele |title="How Rihanna’s foundation is rethinking disaster response" |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90398816/how-rihannas-foundation-is-rethinking-disaster-response |website=Fast Company |publisher=Fast Company |accessdate=1 February 2020}}</ref>

On September 19, in response to Hurricane Dorian, one of the strongest Atlantic storms in history, CLF announced a $1 million funding package to be distributed to Airlink, All Hands and Hearts, Direct Relief, the Information Technology Disaster Resource Center, Team Rubicon and World Central Kitchen<ref>{{cite web |title=CLF Deploys Additional $1 Million to Help Rebuild Bahamas |url=https://claralionelfoundation.org/news/clf-deploys-additional-1-million-to-help-rebuild-bahamas/ |website=Clara Lionel Foundation Latest News |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref> to:

In September 2016, the Clara Lionel Foundation partnered with Global Partnership for Education and Global Citizen on a multi-year initiative to support education across the world. Through this push, Rihanna hoped to advocate for more than a quarter of a billion children who are not currently in school as well as about 330 million students who aren't learning in the schools they're in. As GPE's new Global Ambassador, Rihanna aimed to reach more than 60 developing countries, prioritizing those with the most need, including children in conflict and crisis areas.<ref name="rap-up Rihanna GA" />

In early May 2016, Rihanna announced a scholarship program through the Clara Lionel Foundation, that will award students attending college in the United States. The scholarship is need-based, with scholarships ranging from $5,000 to $50,000 and may be renewed for up to three more years or until they earn their bachelor's degree. The only requirements for eligibility were that applicants have been accepted into a bachelor's degree program at an accredited four-year U.S. college or university for the 2016-17 year and that they are residents of either Barbados, Brazil, Cuba, Haiti, Guyana, Jamaica, or the U.S. Speaking to USA Today College Rihanna stated, "To be able to give the gift of an education is actually an honor, higher education will help provide perspective, opportunities and learning to a group of kids who really deserve it. I am thrilled to be able to do this."<ref>http://time.com/4323769/rihanna-global-scholarship-program/</ref><ref>https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2016/05/10/477491644/rihanna-launches-college-scholarships-for-foreign-students</ref>
