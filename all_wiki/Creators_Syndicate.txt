==History==
Creators Syndicate originated on February 13, 1987, after the December 24, 1986-announced sale of the [[Irvine, California]]-based [[News America Syndicate]] to [[King Features Syndicate]], a [[print syndication]] company owned by [[The Hearst Corporation]].<ref name="Popular">{{cite news |page=4 |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=February 13, 1987 |title=Popular Advice Columnist Ann Landers Joins Tribune |accessdate=August 18, 2012|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-02-13/news/8701120036_1_america-syndicate-creators-syndicate-chicago-sun-times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|page=4F |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 16, 1986 |author=Jeff Rowe |title=Murdoch News America Group Is Up for Sale |accessdate=August 18, 2012|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Hearst-Agrees-to-Buy-News-America-Syndicate/id-439a044b39d61bc1c695957af237bc99}}</ref> The pending sale of News America Syndicate, which was first reported by [[Advertising Age]] in October 1986,<ref>{{cite news |page=2D |newspaper=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |date=October 21, 1986 |title=2 New York Papers Deny Merger Rumor |author= United Press International |accessdate=August 18, 2012 |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-10-21/business/8603040097_1_daily-news-president-rupert-murdoch-magazine}}</ref> prompted 36-year-old News America Syndicate president [[Richard S.

[[Milton Caniff]] was another of several important cartoonists who had tried unsuccessfully to secure rights to their creations. In 1946, he walked away from the enormously popular ''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'' comic strip because his syndicate insisted that they own his creation.

[[Bil Keane]], creator of ''[[The Family Circus]]'', described Creators Syndicate as "the first breath of fresh air the syndicates have had in 100 years of existence."<ref>{{Cite journal|date=21 March 1987|title='B.C.' comic joining Ann Landers at CS|journal=Editor & Publisher}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a story about Newcombe with the headline, “A Superhero for Cartoonists?”<ref>{{Cite news|title=A Superhero for Cartoonists|date=14 June 1987|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Today, largely as a result of Creators Syndicate, all syndicates grant cartoonists ownership rights to their work.
