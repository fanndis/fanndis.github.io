'''''Speak Now''''' is the third [[studio album]] by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. It was released on October 25, 2010, by [[Big Machine Records]].

Swift wrote the album entirely by herself, and co-produced all tracks with longtime collaborator [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]]. She described the album as a loose [[concept album]] about confessions, inspired by her personal life.<ref name="RollingStone"/> The music of ''Speak Now'' combines [[country pop]] styles of her previous albums with [[Rock music|rock]] sensibility, drawing influences from [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[pop punk]], [[pop rock]] and [[soft rock]]. The lyrics revolve around Swift's recurring romantic themes of love, heartbreak and forgiveness. It transcends the fairy tale-inspired theme of its predecessor, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008), to explore Swift's growing maturity in perspectives.

Six songs were released as [[single (music)|singles]] to support ''Speak Now''. Four songs from the album reached the top-10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: the first two singles—"[[Mine (Taylor Swift song)|Mine]]" and "[[Back to December]]", the promotional single "[[Speak Now (song)|Speak Now]]", and the deluxe bonus track "If This Was a Movie". Three singles peaked within the top 20: "[[Mean (song)|Mean]]", "[[Sparks Fly (song)|Sparks Fly]]", and "[[Ours (song)|Ours]]". The other single, "[[The Story of Us (song)|The Story of Us]]", was Swift's first single released to [[contemporary hit radio|mainstream pop radio]]. Swift promoted the album with the [[Speak Now World Tour]], which ran from February 2011 to March 2012.

Contemporary critics received ''Speak Now'' with generally positive reviews, with praise centered on Swift's songwriting craftsmanship. The album debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of over one million copies, claiming the biggest one-week sales tally for an album by a female country artist. The album spent six weeks at number one and has sold over 4.71&nbsp;million copies in the United States. It also peaked atop the charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. At the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards|54th Grammy Awards]], ''Speak Now'' was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album|Best Country Album]], and the single "Mean" won [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Country Solo Performance|Best Country Solo Performance]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' featured ''Speak Now'' in their 2012 list of the "50 Best Female Albums of All Time".

==Recording and title==
Swift worked on the album for two years prior to its release.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news|last=John |first=Christopher |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/07/21/taylor-swift-sets-release-date-for-new-album-speak-now/ |title=Taylor Swift Sets Release Date for New Album 'Speak Now'&nbsp;– Speakeasy&nbsp;— WSJ |work=The Wall Street Journal |date= July 21, 2010|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref> Swift wrote all of the songs on the album without co-writers. In an analysis of Swift's lyrics, ''[[The Oxonian Review]]'' noted themes of regret and solitude, highlighting that "December is a month to get through so we can return to the beginning, and is certainly not a month to relish. Yet, Swift goes there—'all the time'—in 'Back to December' by delivering an apology to an ex-boyfriend, which she never did on her prior two albums."<ref>[http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/taylor-swift-needs-a-gap-year/ Taylor Swift needs a gap year]. ''[[The Oxonian Review]]''. Retrieved November 2, 2010.</ref> Music writer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] viewed that the album musically is "no great progression from ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' but rather a subtle shift toward pure pop with the country accents [...] used as flavoring".<ref name="AllMusic"/>

Recording sessions for the album took place at several recording locations, including Aimeeland Studio, Blackbird Studios, and [[Capitol Studios]] in Hollywood, California, Pain in the Art Studio, and Starstruck Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, and Stonehurst Studio in Bowling Green, Kentucky.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/5tzzi5sS3?url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=8253061 Product Page: ''Speak Now''].

According to Big Machine Records president/CEO [[Scott Borchetta]], the album's original title was ''Enchanted''. He explained: "We were at lunch, and she had played me a bunch of the new songs. I looked at her and I'm like, 'Taylor, this record isn't about fairy tales and high school anymore. That's not where you're at. I don't think the record should be called ''Enchanted.''" After the discussion, Swift then excused herself from the table at that point. By the time she came back, she had the ''Speak Now'' title, which comes closer to representing the evolution that the album represents in her career and in her still-young understanding of the world.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roland |first=Tom |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/15/us-swift-idUSTRE69E5RK20101015?pageNumber=3 |title=Taylor Swift ready to Speak Now with third album |work=Reuters |date= October 15, 2010|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}</ref>

The ''Korean Focus Times'' praised it by saying: "Taylor Swift charms Korea in style, radiant...with pitch-perfect and sincere vocals. The dedication of the fans present was boundless, the cheers of the crowd were sometimes louder than the music itself." The ''New York Times'' claimed the tour "went off, as did every number, with clockwork professionalism and thousands of voices singing along and screaming between the lines. Ms. Swift, 22, is their superstar....her songs are taut, tuneful narratives."<ref name="news">{{cite web|url=http://www.taylorswift.com/news/o1287965052241?post=taylor-to-release-live-cd-dvd#o1287965052241 |title=Taylor Swift News and Blog |publisher=Taylorswift.com |date=September 21, 2011 |accessdate=September 23, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011141259/http://www.taylorswift.com/news/o1287965052241?post=taylor-to-release-live-cd-dvd |archivedate=October 11, 2011 }}</ref>
