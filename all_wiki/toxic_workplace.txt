{{short description|Workplace riddled with heavy drama and infighting}}
A '''toxic workplace''' is a workplace that is marked by significant drama and infighting, where personal battles often harm [[productivity]]. Toxic workplaces are often considered the result of toxic employers and/or toxic employees who are motivated by personal gain ([[Power (social and political)|power]], [[money]], [[Celebrity|fame]] or special [[Social status|status]]), use unethical, mean-spirited and sometimes illegal means to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] and annoy those around them; and whose motives are to maintain or increase power, money or special status or divert attention away from their performance shortfalls and misdeeds. Toxic workers do not recognize a duty to the organization for which they work or their co-workers in terms of [[ethics]] or [[professional conduct]] toward others.<ref name = "Housman and Minor, HBS, 2015" > {{ Cite web | url = https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/16-057_d45c0b4f-fa19-49de-8f1b-4b12fe054fea.pdf | title = Toxic Workers  | access-date = 2019-08-25 | first1 = Michael | last1 = Housman | first2 = Minor | last2 = Dylan | date = 2015-11-01 | website = Harvard Business School | quote = Thus, a toxic worker is defined as a worker that engages in behavior that is harmful to an organization, including either its property or people. | format = pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190815063749/http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/16-057_d45c0b4f-fa19-49de-8f1b-4b12fe054fea.pdf | archive-date = 2019-08-15  | df = dmy-all }} </ref> Toxic workers define relationships with co-workers, not by [[organizational structure]] but by co-workers they favour and those they do not like or trust.<ref>Benoit, Suzanne (2011) "Toxic Employees: great companies resolve this problem, you can too!" Falmouth, Maine: BCSPublishing</ref>

Quite similarly, Harder et al. (2014) define a '''toxic work environment''' as an environment that negatively impacts the viability of an organization. They specify: "It is reasonable to conclude that an organization can be considered toxic if it is ineffective as well as destructive to its employees".

In the [[United States]], the issue of [[workplace bullying]] is getting increasing attention from state governments; twenty-six states have introduced a version of the Healthy Workplace Bill which provides a definition of this conduct and support for employers to address the behaviour through discipline.<ref>The Healthy Workplace Campaign accessed June 14, 2011 at: http://www.healthyworkplacebill.org/</ref>

Studies by National Occupational Safety and Health found toxic workplace environments a leading cause of workplace violence such as “violent acts, including physical assaults and threats of assault, directed toward persons at work or on duty.” Studies on this issue include verbal violence (threats, verbal abuse, hostility, harassment, and the like) can cause significant psychological trauma and stress, even if no physical injury takes place. Verbal assaults and hostility can also escalate to physical violence.

==Corporate and organizational results==
This phenomenon harms both the company and the other employees, including those who are not direct targets. Co-workers are distracted by drama, [[gossip]] and by choosing sides in the ongoing animosity. This can translate into lost productivity.<ref>Bitting, Robert. "Using Effective Leadership Strategies in the Workplace". {{cite web |url=http://www.robertbitting.com/files/articles/Toxic-Employees-in-the-Work-Place.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813050332/http://www.robertbitting.com/files/articles/Toxic-Employees-in-the-Work-Place.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-13 }}. Retrieved May 13, 2011.</ref> While employees are [[Distraction|distracted]] by this activity, they cannot devote time and attention to the achievement of business goals. Positively [[Motivation|motivated]] and ethical employees may try to speak up to a toxic employee but this can make them a target (see [[whistleblower]]). Managers of toxic employees can feel intimidated by a toxic employee and try to appease the employee in an effort to avoid confrontation. Over time, positively motivated employees drift away from the workplace and may begin to view management as inept and ineffective. This can result in poor job performance as they begin to feel less valued, therefore less loyal to the company. 

Fellow employees may begin to experience physical symptoms from the [[Occupational stress|stress]] and worry over whether they or someone they care about in the work place may be targeted. This can even develop into a clinical depression requiring treatment.<ref>Davies, Andrews and Smith. "Do You Have a Toxic Employee in Your Workplace?" Retrieved May 13, 2011</ref>

==Prevention and resolution==
[[Intervention (counseling)|Interventions]] to address this negative behaviour in the workplace should be undertaken carefully.<ref name = "Ryan, BusinessWeek 2007" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/nov2007/ca2007111_532773_page_2.htm | title = The Toxic Employee | access-date = 2019-08-25 | first = Liz | last = Ryan | date = 2007-11-01 | website = BusinessWeek (now [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]) | quote =  Interpersonal relationships, contrary to popular opinion, are not irrelevant to performance planning.

When toxic workers leave the workplace, it can improve the culture overall because the remaining staff become more engaged and productive.<ref>Mayhew, Ruth "Is employee turnover always bad?" accessed at: http://smallbusiness.chron.com/employee-turnover-always-bad-11089.html</ref> Companies who articulate a strong set of cultural values regarding communication, respect and professionalism as well as a [[performance appraisal|performance evaluation]] system that ranks both technical performance and the professional treatment of fellow employees are felt by [[human resources|HR]] professionals to be less [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]].<ref name="SHARP">SHARP Report, April 2011, Washington State Department of Labor and Industries, "Workplace Bullying and Disruptive Behaviour" accessed at: http://www.lni.wa.gov/safety/research/files/bullying.pdf</ref>
