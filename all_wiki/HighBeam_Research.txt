== History ==
The company was established in August 2002 after [[Patrick Spain]], who had just sold [[Hoover's]], which he had co-founded, bought [[eLibrary]] and [[Encyclopedia.com]] from [[Tucows]]. The new company was called Alacritude, LLC (a combination of Alacrity and Attitude). ELibrary had a library of 1,200 newspaper, magazine and radio/TV transcript archives that were generally not freely available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/about-us|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728110114/http://www.highbeam.com/about-us|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 28, 2011|title=About Us|website=HighBeam Research|accessdate=March 23, 2012}}</ref>

Original investors included Prism Opportunity Fund of Chicago and 1 to 1 Ventures of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]].

Spain stated, "There was a glaring gap between free search like [[Google]] and high-end offerings like [[LexisNexis]] and [[Factiva]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/fina-news/article.php/3315981|title=Q&A: Patrick Spain, Founder HighBeam|work=[[InterNetNews]]|date=February 20, 2004|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}</ref>

Later in 2002, it bought Researchville.com. By 2003, it had increased its archive base to articles from 2,600 publishers. In 2004, it was renamed HighBeam Research. In 2005, it increased its publisher base to 3,500 publishers. In 2006, [[Oxford University Press]], [[Knight Ridder]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' archives were added. In 2008, it was purchased by [[Gale (publisher)|Gale]], a subsidiary of [[Cengage]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Gwen|url=http://www.websearchguide.ca/netblog/archives/008099.html|title=Gale Acquired HighBeam Research|work=Web search guide|date=December 16, 2008|accessdate=December 4, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305194620/http://www.websearchguide.ca/netblog/archives/008099.html|archivedate=March 5, 2012}}</ref> Highbeam featured many articles by the UK based [[Trinity Mirror]] Group.

Until late 2018, Highbeam Research was a partner in the [[Womensforum]] network and a major content provider for the ''WomensForum'' women's issues research website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womensforum.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3541:highbeamcom&catid=161:education-sites&Itemid=190 |title=Highbeam Research is a WomensForum Network Partner|work=WomensForum|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}</ref>
