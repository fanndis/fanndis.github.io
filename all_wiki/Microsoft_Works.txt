'''Microsoft Works''' was a [[office suite|productivity software suite]] developed by [[Microsoft]] and sold from 1987 to 2009. Its core functionality included a [[word processor]], a [[spreadsheet]] and a [[database management system]]. Later versions had a calendar application and a dictionary while older releases included a [[terminal emulator]]. Works was available as a standalone program, and as part of a namesake home productivity suite.  Because of its low cost ($40 retail, or as low as $2 [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-eyes-ads-as-consumers-close-wallets/2100-1012_3-5954406.html|title=Microsoft eyes ads as consumers close wallets|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}</ref> companies frequently pre-installed Works on their low-cost machines. Works was smaller, less expensive, and had fewer features than [[Microsoft Office]] and other major office suites available at the time.

==History==
Microsoft Works originated as MouseWorks, an integrated spreadsheet, word processor and database program, designed for the Macintosh by ex-Apple employee Don Williams and Rupert Lissner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vy8EAAAAMBAJ|title=InfoWorld|first=InfoWorld Media Group|last=Inc|date=28 July 1986|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc.|accessdate=21 July 2016|via=Google Books}}</ref> Williams was planning to emulate the success of [[AppleWorks]], a similar product for Apple II computers. Bill Gates and his Head of Acquisitions, [[Alan M. Boyd]], convinced Williams to license the product to Microsoft instead.<ref>'''''Gates'''''. By Stephen Manes, Paul Andrews, Page 328</ref> Initially it was to be a scaled-down version of Office for the (then) small laptops such as the Radio Shack [[TRS-80 Model 100]] which Microsoft was developing. As laptops grew in power, Microsoft Works, as it was to be called, evolved as a popular product in its own right.

On September 14, 1987, Microsoft unveiled Works for DOS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/History/The-History-of-Microsoft-1987 |title=The History of Microsoft - 1987 |author=Tina |date=29 April 2009 |work=Channel 9 |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> The initial version 1.x of Works ran on any PC with at least 256k of memory. Works 2.x, introduced in 1990, required 512k and 3.x, introduced in 1992, required 640k.

In 1991, Microsoft issued the first Windows version of Works, titled MS Works for Windows 2.0. System requirements consisted of Windows 3.0, a 286 CPU, and 1MB of memory. Works 3.x in 1993 moved to requiring Windows 3.1, a 386 CPU, and 4MB of memory. Subsequent releases were for Windows 95 and up and the final version was Works 9.x in 2007, requiring Windows XP or Vista, 256MB of memory, and a Pentium 4 CPU.

Microsoft released Macintosh versions of Works starting with Works 2.0 in 1988. The version numbering roughly followed that of Windows releases.

Through version 4.5a, Works used a [[Monolithic system|monolithic program architecture]] whereby its [[word processor]], [[spreadsheet]] and [[database]] documents ran in [[window (computing)|window]]s of the same program interface. This resulted in a small memory and disk footprint, which enabled it to run on slower computers with requirements as low as 6 MB of RAM and 12 MB free disk space. It also provided a mini version of Excel for DOS systems as a DOS version of that program was not available.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/135878 System requirements for Works for Windows 95].</ref> Works 2000 (Version 5.0) switched to a modular architecture which opens each document as a separate instance and uses the print engine from [[Internet Explorer]].

Version 9.0, the final version, was available in two editions: an advertisement-free version, available in retail and for OEMs, and an ad-supported free version (Works SE) which was available only to [[Original Equipment Manufacturers|OEMs]] for preinstallation on new computers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fried |first=Ina |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-9922750-56.html |title=Microsoft quietly offering ad-funded Works &#124; Beyond Binary - CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2008-04-18 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref>

In late 2009, Microsoft announced it was discontinuing Works and replacing it with [[Microsoft Office 2010#Starter Edition|Office 2010 Starter Edition]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111213182426/http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/2009/10/08/office-starter-2010-to-replace-microsoft-works/ Office Starter 2010 to replace Microsoft Works]</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120102131557/http://blogs.technet.com/b/office2010/archive/2009/10/07/new-ways-to-try-and-buy-microsoft-office-2010.aspx</ref> although it replaced only the word processor and spreadsheet components but not the calendar or the database.

==Features==
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}
Microsoft Works has built-in compatibility for the Microsoft Office document formats (<tt>DOC</tt> and <tt>XLS</tt>), including, but not limited to, the ability of the Works Word Processor to open [[Microsoft Word]] documents and the ability of the Works Spreadsheet to open [[Microsoft Excel]] workbooks. Newer{{Which|date=April 2017}} versions include task panes but do not include significantly updated features. Even in the final version (Version 9.0), the [[Windows 95]]-era icons and toolbars were not updated to make them consistent with later application software.

While its utility for larger organizations is limited by its use of incompatible [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] native .<tt>WKS</tt> (spreadsheet), .<tt>WDB</tt> (database), and .<tt>WPS</tt> (word processor) file formats, the simplicity of integrating database/spreadsheet data into word processor documents (e.g., [[mail merge]]) allow it to remain an option for some small and home-based business owners. Version 4.5a is particularly noted in this respect.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} The database management system, while a "[[flat file database|flat file]]" (i.e., non-[[Relational Database|relational]]) allows the novice user to perform complex transformations through formulas (which use standard algebraic syntax and can be self-referential) and user-defined reports which can be copied as text to the clipboard. A 'Works Portfolio' utility offers [[Microsoft Binder]]-like functionality.

By installing the [[Office 2007|2007 Office System]] Compatibility Pack, the Works Word Processor and Spreadsheet can import and export [[Office Open XML]] document formats, although they are converted rather than being operated upon natively. The Works Calendar can store appointments, integrates with the [[Windows Address Book]], as well as Address Book's successor, Windows Contacts, and can remind users of birthdays and anniversaries. It supports importing and exporting [[iCalendar]] (<tt>.ICS</tt>) files. It does not support subscribing to iCalendar files or publishing them online via [[WebDAV]]. Up to version 8, using the Works Task Launcher, the calendar and contacts from [[Windows Address Book]] could be synchronized with portable devices. In Works 9.0, the sync capability has been removed.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940004/ Works 9 does not support synchronizing the Works Calendar and the Address Book together with portable devices]</ref>

==File format compatibility and other issues==
Microsoft makes file format conversion filters for [[Microsoft Word]] for opening and saving to Works Word Processor format.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=bf41401e-70fa-465d-ae2e-cf44dbf05297 Microsoft Works 6–9 File Converter]</ref><ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=b37a2510-6ad0-495a-8262-48305325110b Microsoft Works 4 File Converter]</ref> Microsoft Office Excel can import newer Works Spreadsheets because the newer Works Spreadsheet also uses the Excel format but with a different extension (*.xlr).<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/271074 Works: How to Recover Data from a Corrupted Works Spreadsheet]</ref> There is an import filter for older Works 2.0 spreadsheet format (*.wks);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rl-software.com/converter/wks-wdb-to-excel.htm|title=Open WKS and WDB files in your speadsheet<!--sic?--> programm|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016|archive-date=19 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319102532/http://www.rl-software.com/converter/wks-wdb-to-excel.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> however it may be disabled in the registry by newer [[Microsoft Office]] [[Service pack]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/david_leblanc/archive/2008/01/04/office-sp3-and-file-formats.aspx|title=Office SP3 and File formats|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2016}}</ref> As far as Works Spreadsheet 3.x/4.x/2000 (*.wks) and Works database (any version of *.wdb) files are concerned, Microsoft does not provide an import filter for Excel or Access.

==Works Suite==
In 1997, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Home Essentials, which packaged several of its home productivity titles into a single suite that was sold for a then low price described in a review by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' as "one of the best bargains ever offered." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-03-16/business/9703160192_1_microsoft-internet-explorer-microsoft-home-microsoft-Encarta |title=Microsoft Home Essentials 97 Produced by... - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1997-03-16 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref> Home Essentials continued to evolve and, beginning with the 1999 edition, took the namesake of Works, becoming Works Suite.  A slimmer version of the suite, dubbed Works Deluxe, was also offered for that year, but discontinued thereafter.

As the programs within Works Suite were developed separately and sold individually, each had a unique look and feel.  They were integrated by a task plane, which picked the appropriate program for the user to accomplish each task.  In addition to the core programs, each version of Works Suite also included programs such as FoneSync in 2001, and PowerPoint Viewer beginning in 2005.  Later editions of Works Suite prompted users to upgrade to more featured versions of the included programs at a discounted rate.

In addition to retail sales, Works Suite was included with the purchase of a new computer by several manufacturers, notably [[Dell]] and [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]].  Works Suite was discontinued after the 2006 edition.  Works was later bundled with Word as Works Plus 2008, but this was made available only to OEMs.
