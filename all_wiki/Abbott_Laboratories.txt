=== Foundation and early history ===
In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the [[University of Michigan]], founded the '''Abbott Alkaloidal Company''' in Ravenswood, Chicago. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a [[Herbalism|medicinal plant]], generally an [[alkaloid]] (e.g., [[morphine]], [[quinine]], [[strychnine]] and [[codeine]]), which he formed into tiny "dosimetric granules". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Abbott-Laboratories-Company-History.html |title=Abbott Laboratories Company History |publisher=Funding Universe |accessdate= 17 April 2013}}</ref> In 1922, the company moved from Ravenswood to North Chicago, Illinois.

=== International expansion ===
Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21).{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} Abbott started operations in [[Pakistan]] as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently, two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in [[Karachi]] continue to produce pharmaceutical products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abbott.com.pk/11_Aboutus.htm|title=About Us}}</ref> Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} In 1964, it merged with Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott, and Richard Ross gained a seat on Abbott's board of directors until his retirement in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1993-12-11-9312110107-story.html|title=RICHARD MOORE ROSS, 77, ABBOTT LABS EXECUTIVE|first=Chicago|last=Tribune|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref> The acquisition of Ross brought Similac under the Abbott umbrella.

===Taxation===
{{See also|Double Irish arrangement}}
On 19 March 2019, it was reported that Abbott was a long-term user of the [[Double Irish]] tax structure, a legal but controversial Irish taxation tool used by U.S. multinationals to reduce U.S. corporate taxes on non-U.S profits.<ref name="di"/> Abbott's Irish holding company, the Bermuda-resident Abbott Laboratories Vascular Enterprises (ALVE), employed no staff in 2017, but was responsible for distributing Abbot's products and licensing its technology worldwide.<ref name="di"/> Newly filed accounts showed that ALVE was incorporated in 2003 and had a pre-tax profit of €2 billion in 2016 and 2017 on revenues of €5.2 billion; no taxation was paid on these profits.<ref name="di"/> ALVE had never filed accounts in Ireland since 2003 as it was structured as an [[unlimited liability company]] (ULC); however, new EU accounts directives required ALVE to file Irish accounts in 2018.<ref name="di"/> These accounts listed ALVE's registered office as the address of Ireland's largest tax-law firm, [[Matheson (law firm)|Matheson]], who have been identified with Double Irish tax structures for Microsoft and Google.<ref name="di">{{cite news|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/abbott-ireland-tax-avoidance-4528308-Mar2019/|title=How the IDA's top client used Ireland to siphon billions offshore tax-free|newspaper=[[TheJournal.ie]]|author=Peter Bodkin|date=19 March 2019|accessdate=19 March 2019|quote=Meanwhile, through a myriad of subsidiaries and system of inter-company charges involving a variation on the infamous so-called 'double Irish' structure, its local operations have also legally shaved their tax bills with the Exchequer despite pulling in huge sales.}}</ref><ref name="wsj">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/dublin-moves-to-block-controversial-tax-gambit-1381890312| title=Dublin Moves to Block Controversial Tax Gambit|quote=At least 125 major U.S. companies have registered several hundred subsidiaries or investment funds at 70 Sir John Rogerson’s Quay, a seven–story building in Dublin’s docklands, according to a review of government and corporate records by The Wall Street Journal.

==Litigation==

===Humira===
In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to "initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira" ([[Adalimumab]]) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=af.37juYEPaQ |title=Cambridge Antibody Wins Lawsuit Against Abbott Labs (Update5) – Bloomberg }}</ref>

Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development. Of this sum, the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) of the United Kingdom received US$191 million, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further $7.5 million over five years from 2006 providing that Humira remains on the market.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Depakote===
On 2 October 2012, the company was charged with a $500 million fine and $198.5 million forfeiture for illegal marketing of [[Depakote]] for uses not approved by the FDA. The court also ordered Abbott to a five-year term of probation and court supervision.<ref name="doj">[https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/May/12-civ-585.html Abbott Labs to Pay $1.5 Billion to Resolve Criminal & Civil Investigations of Off-label Promotion of Depakote], Press Release, [[United States Department of Justice]] Office of Public Affairs, 7 May 2012.

Following Abbott's spinoff of its research-based pharmaceuticals business, it no longer owns the commercial rights and associated responsibilities for Humira and Depakote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/abbott/update-2-abbott-ultra-bullish-on-humira-despite-spinoff-plan-idUSN1E79K06F20111021|title=Abbott ultra-bullish on Humira despite spinoff plan|website=Reuters}}</ref>
