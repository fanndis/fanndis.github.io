'''William Holcombe Pryor Jr.''' (born April 26, 1962) is an American lawyer and jurist who serves as a circuit judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]]. He is a former Commissioner of the [[United States Sentencing Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|last=U.S. Sentencing Commission|title=Bios of Commissioners|url=http://www.ussc.gov/About_the_Commission/About_the_Commissioners/Commissioner_Bios.cfm|accessdate=November 8, 2013}}</ref> Previously, he was the [[Attorney General of Alabama]], from 1997 to 2004.

==Background==
Pryor was born in 1962 in [[Mobile, Alabama]], the son of William Holcombe Pryor and Laura Louise Bowles.  Pryor was raised in a devoutly Roman Catholic family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/pryor-perhaps-the-most-polarizing-supreme-court-justice-possibility/2017/01/28/f25bb7e2-e4ae-11e6-ba11-63c4b4fb5a63_story.html|title=Pryor: Perhaps the most polarizing Supreme Court justice possibility|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref> He and his siblings attended [[McGill–Toolen Catholic High School]] in Mobile. He attended Northeast Louisiana University (now [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]]) on a band scholarship, and graduated in 1984 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] ''[[Latin honors#United States|magna cum laude]]''. He then attended [[Tulane University Law School]], where he was editor-in-chief of the ''[[Tulane Law Review]]'' and graduated in 1987 with a [[Juris Doctor]] ''magna cum laude''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/pryor-william-holcombe-jr|title=Pryor, William Holcombe, Jr. {{!}} Federal Judicial Center|website=www.fjc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref>

== Legal career ==
Pryor served as a [[law clerk]] to Judge [[John Minor Wisdom]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] from 1987–88.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=Kevin|last2=Davis|first2=Charles|title=Potential nominee profile: William Pryor (Expanded)|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/01/potential-nominee-profile-william-pryor|accessdate=July 2, 2018|work=SCOTUSblog|date=January 10, 2017}}</ref> 

Pryor worked as a private attorney from 1988–95, serving as adjunct professor of maritime law at the [[Cumberland School of Law]] at [[Samford University]] from 1989–95. Pryor is currently a [[visiting professor]] at the [[University of Alabama School of Law]]<ref>{{cite web|last=University of Alabama|title=Faculty Page|url=http://www.law.ua.edu/directory/People/view/Judge_William_Pryor|accessdate=November 8, 2013}}</ref> and an [[adjunct professor]] at the Cumberland School of Law at Samford University.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cumberland School of Law|title=Adjunct Faculty Page|url=http://cumberland.samford.edu/faculty/adjunct|accessdate=November 8, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109094331/http://cumberland.samford.edu/faculty/adjunct|archivedate=November 9, 2013}}</ref>

== Political career ==
In 1994, Pryor was introduced to [[Jeff Sessions]], who was then campaigning to become the [[Attorney General of Alabama]].<ref name=NYT10june05>{{cite news |last1=Stolberg |first1=Sheryl Gay |title=A Different Timpanist |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/10/politics/a-different-timpanist.html |accessdate=July 2, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 10, 2005 |language=en}}</ref>  Sessions won, and from 1995 to 1997 Pryor served as Alabama's deputy attorney general.<ref name=NYT10june05/> When Sessions became a U.S. Senator in 1997, Alabama Governor [[Fob James]] made Pryor the state's Attorney General.<ref name=NYT10june05/> He was, at that time, the youngest state attorney general in the United States. Pryor was elected in 1998 and reelected in 2002. At reelection, Pryor received nearly 59% of the vote, the highest percentage of any statewide candidate.<ref>Alabama Department of Archives & History (August 25, 2009). [http://www.archives.alabama.gov/conoff/pryor.html Alabama Attorneys General.]</ref>

Pryor received national attention in 2003 when he called for the removal of Alabama Chief Justice [[Roy Moore]], who had disobeyed a federal court order to remove a [[Ten Commandments]] monument from the Alabama Judicial Building. Pryor said that although he agreed with the propriety of displaying the Ten Commandments in a courthouse, he was bound to follow the court order and uphold the rule of law. Pryor personally prosecuted Moore for violations of the Canons of Judicial Ethics, and the [[Alabama Court of the Judiciary]] unanimously removed Moore from office.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/11/13/moore.tencommandments/ Ten Commandments Judge Removed From Office], CNN (November 14, 2003).</ref>

Pryor has been criticized<ref>Kyle Whitmire (April 3, 2015).

== Federal judicial service ==
=== Eleventh Circuit nomination and confirmation ===
Pryor was nominated to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] by President [[George W. Bush]] on April 9, 2003, to fill a seat vacated by Judge [[Emmett Ripley Cox]], who had assumed [[senior status]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Presidential Nomination 512, 108th United States Congress|date=April 9, 2003|url=https://www.congress.gov/nomination/108th-congress/512|publisher=[[United States Congress]]|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> Originally, [[William H. Steele (judge)|William H. Steele]] had been nominated to the seat in 2001, but his nomination had become stalled in the Democratic-controlled [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] during the [[107th United States Congress]] because [[African-American]] groups protested his decisions in two civil rights cases as a magistrate judge. His nomination was withdrawn in January 2003. Pryor was nominated as Steele's replacement.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Despite the fact that the [[108th United States Congress]] was controlled by the Republican Party, Senate Democrats refused to allow Pryor to be confirmed, criticizing him as an extremist, citing statements he had made such as referring to the Supreme Court as "nine octogenarian lawyers" and saying that Roe v. Wade was the "worst abomination in the history of constitutional law."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-108shrg91200/html/CHRG-108shrg91200.htm|title=CONFIRMATION HEARING ON THE NOMINATIONS OF WILLIAM H.

During the confirmation hearing, Pryor was criticized in particular for filing an [[amicus brief]] in 2003 on behalf of the State of Alabama in the U.S. Supreme Court case of ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' that urged the Court to uphold Texas penal code § 21.06, which classifies homosexual sex as a misdemeanor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-president-supreme-court-gay-rights-abortion-william-h-pryor-a7422416.html|title=Donald Trump's potential Supreme Court judge pick thinks gay people should be jailed for having sex|last=Mortimer|first=Caroline|date=November 17, 2016|website=The Independent|access-date=January 12, 2017}}</ref> Pryor wrote in the brief that "this Court has never recognized a fundamental right to engage in sexual activity outside of monogamous heterosexual marriage, let alone to engage in homosexual sodomy,"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Costa |first1=Daniela |title=Trump Supreme Court Pick William Pryor Thinks Gays Should Be Jailed For Having Sex In Their Homes |url=https://thegailygrind.com/2016/11/15/trump-supreme-court-pick-william-pryor-thinks-gays-jailed-sex-homes/ |accessdate=9 December 2018 |publisher=Gaily Grind |date=15 November 2016}}</ref> further arguing that the recognition of a constitutional right to sodomy would "logically extend" to activities like "prostitution, adultery, necrophilia, bestiality, incest and pedophilia."<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript227_full.html Transcript], ''[[NOW on PBS]]'', PBS (July 11, 2003).</ref><ref>Lawrence Hurley, [https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-trump-court-idUSL2N18G273 Trump's U.S. high court list: all conservative, some provocative], Reuters (May 19, 2015) (quoting [http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/supreme_court/briefs/02-102/02-102.mer.ami.states.pdf Brief of the States of Alabama, South Carolina, and Utah as Amici Curiae in Support of Respondent], ''[[Lawrence v.

Due to a [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]] of his nomination, President George W. Bush installed Pryor as a circuit court judge on February 20, 2004, using a [[recess appointment]] to bypass the regular Senate confirmation process.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Neil A.|title=Bypassing Senate For Second Time, Bush Seats Judge|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/21/us/bypassing-senate-for-second-time-bush-seats-judge.html|accessdate=July 2, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 21, 2004}}</ref> Pryor resigned as Alabama's attorney general that same day and took his judicial oath for a term lasting until the end of the first session of the [[109th Congress]] (December 22, 2005), when his appointment would have ended had he not been eventually confirmed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/fyi/news/08/02/extra.recess.appointments/index.html|title=Recess Appointments|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=August 2, 2005|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref>

On May 23, 2005, Senator [[John McCain]] announced an agreement between seven Republican and seven Democratic U.S. Senators, the [[Gang of 14]], to ensure an [[up-or-down vote]] on Pryor and two other stalled Bush nominees, [[Priscilla Owen]] and [[Janice Rogers Brown]]. On June 9, 2005, Pryor was confirmed to the Eleventh Circuit by a vote of 53–45.<ref>{{cite web|title=Presidential Nomination 200, 109th United States Congress|date=February 14, 2005|url=https://www.congress.gov/nomination/109th-congress/200|publisher=[[United States Congress]]|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=1&vote=00133|title=U.S. Senate: Roll Call Vote|work=senate.gov|accessdate=July 8, 2018}}</ref> 

Pryor received his commission on June 10, 2005. On June 20, 2005, he was sworn in at the age of 43. Pryor was the only judge appointed to the Eleventh Circuit by President George W. Bush.<ref>{{citation|author=Denis Steven Rutkus|title=U.S. Circuit and District Court Nominations by President George W.

=== Sentencing Commission service ===
President [[Barack Obama]] nominated Pryor to serve as a commissioner on the [[United States Sentencing Commission]] on April 15, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |title=Presidential Nomination 324, 113th United States Congress |date=April 15, 2013 |url=https://www.congress.gov/nomination/113th-congress/324 |publisher=[[United States Congress]] |accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> Pryor had experience with sentencing issues and reform at the state level. 

During his tenure as Attorney General of the State of Alabama, he successfully led the effort to establish, by legislation, the Alabama Sentencing Commission. Pryor has written several law review articles about his experiences with sentencing reform. The Senate unanimously confirmed Pryor by voice vote on June 6, 2013, and he served a term that expired on October 31, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Senate Confirms Three Sentencing Commissioners|url=http://www.ussc.gov/Legislative_and_Public_Affairs/Newsroom/Press_Releases/20130607_Press_Release.pdf|accessdate=November 8, 2013}}</ref> On January 3, 2017, Pryor was named the Acting Chair of the Commission. <ref>{{cite web|title=CIRCUIT JUDGE WILLIAM H.

=== Notable opinions ===
In November 2014, Pryor wrote for the ''[[en banc]]'' circuit when it found, by a vote of 5–4, that an inmate who is no longer classified as a career offender nevertheless cannot seek a sentencing reduction.<ref>{{Bluebook journal |first=|last=Note| title=Recent Case: Eleventh Circuit Holds Misapplication of "Career Offender" Enhancement Not Cognizable Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 | volume=128 | journal=[[Harvard Law Review|Harv.

* ''United States v. Phillips'' (11th Cir. 2016). Judge Pryor wrote an opinion for a unanimous panel, affirming the denial of Ted Phillips's motion to suppress. The police caught Phillips, a convicted felon, with a firearm while they were arresting him on a civil writ of bodily attachment for his failure to pay child support. The Court's opinion explored the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment and the history of civil writs to conclude that the writ for unpaid child support gave the police the authority to arrest Phillips and to conduct a search incident to arrest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201414660.pdf |title=United States v. Phillips|publisher=U.S. Courts |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}</ref>
* ''[[Eternal Word Television Network]], Inc. v. Sec'y, U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Servs. '' (11th Cir. 2014). In a unanimous order, a panel of the Eleventh Circuit enjoined the Secretary of HHS from enforcing the contraception mandate against Catholic television network EWTN.  Judge Pryor specially concurred, explaining why, in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Hobby Lobby, EWTN had shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits under the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]].  The concurrence is particularly notable because Judge Pryor noted that he parted ways with decisions of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits on the subject "because the decisions of those courts are wholly unpersuasive."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/unpub/files/201412696order.pdf |title=Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v.

* ''Walker v. [[R.J. Reynolds Tobacco]] Co.'' (11th Cir. 2013).  On behalf of a unanimous panel, Pryor rejected the due process challenge brought by R.J. Reynolds to the application, as res judicata, of the previous determinations on liability made by a Florida jury in an unorthodox class action against the tobacco companies in the 1990s.  The panel concluded that it was required to give full faith and credit to the decision of the Florida trial court, as interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court and that the application of full faith and credit did not violate the tobacco company's due process rights because R.J. Reynolds had been given notice and an opportunity to be heard throughout the litigation.  The opinion is particularly notable for a colorful paragraph at its conclusion discussing the intractable problem of tobacco litigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201213500.op2.pdf |title=Walker v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. |publisher=U.S. Courts |date=October 31, 2013 |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}</ref>
* ''Day v. Persels & Associates'' (11th Cir. 2013).  Pryor wrote the majority (2–1) opinion vacating a settlement award in a class action relating to debt-settlement services.  The court concluded that the magistrate judge had subject-matter jurisdiction to approve the settlement because unnamed class members are not parties whose consent is required for adjudication by a magistrate judge.  But the court also concluded that the magistrate judge had abused its discretion when it approved a settlement that provided no monetary relief to the class members because he found that the defendants could not pay such monetary relief, but no evidence supported that finding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201211887.pdf |title=Day v. Persels & Associates |publisher=U.S. Courts |date=September 10, 2013 |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}</ref>
* ''United States v. Bellaizac-Hurtado'' (11th Cir. 2012). Pryor wrote the majority (2–1) opinion reversing the convictions of four defendants for drug-trafficking in the territorial waters of Panama because the Act that criminalized their behavior exceeded the authority of Congress under the Offences against the Law of Nations Clause of the Constitution.  The opinion is the first in-depth interpretation of the constitutional provision by a federal circuit court.  Judge Rosemary Barkett specially concurred in the judgment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201114049.pdf|title=United States v. Bellaizac-Hurtado|publisher=}}</ref>
* ''United States v. Shaygan'' (11th Cir. 2011).  Pryor wrote the majority (2–1) opinion vacating an award of over $600,000 in attorney's fees and costs against the United States and the public reprimand of two federal prosecutors.  The court explained that the prosecution was objectively reasonable and did not warrant sanctions under the Hyde Amendment.  The court also concluded that the district court had violated the due process rights of the federal prosecutors when it denied them notice of the charges and an opportunity to be heard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200912129.pdf|title=United States v. Shaygan|publisher=}}</ref>  Pryor later wrote a statement respecting the denial of rehearing en banc of this opinion in United States v. Shaygan'' (11th Cir. April 10, 2012).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200912129.op2.pdf|title=United States v. Shaygan|publisher=}}</ref>  
* ''First Vagabonds Church of God v. Orlando'' (11th Cir. 2011).  Writing for a unanimous en banc court, Pryor rejected an as-applied challenge by Orlando Food Not Bombs to a municipal ordinance that restricted the frequency of its feedings of homeless persons in parks located within a 2-mile radius of the Orlando City Hall.  The court assumed, without deciding, that the feeding of homeless persons constituted expressive conduct and determined that the ordinance, as applied to Orlando Food Not Bombs, constituted a reasonable time, place, or manner restriction and a reasonable regulation of expressive conduct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200816788op2.pdf|title=First Vagabonds Church of God v. Orlando|publisher=}}</ref>
* ''In re United States'' (11th Cir. 2010).  Pryor wrote the majority (2–1) opinion granting a writ of mandamus to substitute an Assistant Administrator of the EPA for the appearance of the Administrator in a case about the ecology of the Everglades.  The panel explained that the district court had abused its discretion in ordering the appearance of the agency head and encroached on the separation of powers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201014535.pdf|title=In re United States|publisher=}}</ref>
* ''Scott v. Roberts'' (11th Cir. 2010).  Pryor wrote for a unanimous panel reversing the district court and preliminarily restraining the enforcement of a Florida law that provided a dollar-for-dollar subsidy to a candidate's opponent once that candidate exceeded a statutory expenditure limit.  The panel concluded that Rick Scott, then-candidate in the Republican primary for the Governor of Florida, had made a substantial showing of likelihood of success on the merits because, even if the law served compelling state interests, the law was not the least restrictive means of serving those interests.  Scott went on to win the Republican primary and the general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201013211.pdf|title=Scott v. Roberts|publisher=}}</ref>
* ''Common Cause/Georgia v. Billups'' (11th Cir. 2009).  Pryor wrote for a unanimous panel upholding a Georgia law that required all registered voters in Georgia to present a government-issued photo identification to be allowed to vote in person.  The law also required Georgia to issue, free of charge, a "Georgia voter identification card" to any registered Georgia voter who lacked an acceptable form of identification.  The panel concluded that the NAACP and voters had standing to challenge the law, but that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to enjoin the law because the burdens on voters from the law were insignificant and the state had legitimate interests in preventing voter fraud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200714664.pdf|title=Common Cause/Georgia v. Billups|publisher=}}</ref>
* ''Pelphrey v. Cobb County'' (11th Cir. 2008). Pryor wrote the majority (2–1) opinion, joined by Judge [[Charles R. Wilson (judge)|Charles R. Wilson]], affirming the district court ruling that sectarian prayers used to open commission meetings did not violate the [[Establishment Clause]] as long as the prayer opportunity was not exploited to proselytize or to advance or disparage any particular faith or belief.  [[U.S. District Court]] Judge [[Donald Middlebrooks]] dissented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200713611.pdf|title=Pelphrey v. Cobb County|publisher=}}</ref>
* '' United States v. Campa,'' (11th Cir. 2008).
