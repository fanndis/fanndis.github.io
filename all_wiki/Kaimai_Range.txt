The '''Kaimai Range''' (sometimes referred to as the ''Kaimai Ranges'') is a mountain range in the [[North Island]] of New Zealand.  It is part of a series of ranges, with the [[Coromandel Range]] to the north and the [[Mamaku Ranges]] to the south. The Kaimai Range separates the [[Waikato]] in the west from the [[Bay of Plenty]] in the east.

The highest point of the range is Mount Te Aroha (952 m), at the foot of which is the town of [[Te Aroha]]. The range's terrain is rough, and only two roads pass over it: [[New Zealand State Highway 2|State Highway 2]], across the northern end of the range through [[Karangahake Gorge]], and [[New Zealand State Highway 29|State Highway 29]] from [[Tauranga]] to [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]]. Mt Te Aroha can be described as the northern head peak of the Kaimai Range.

The New Zealand [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] gives a translation of "eat fermented food" for ''Kaimāī''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/maori-language-week/1000-maori-place-names|title=1000 Māori place names|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=6 August 2019}}</ref> 

The Kaimai Ranges feature in local Maori folklore. The name Te Aroha translates from Maori as Te - The & Aroha  - Love. Literally "the love". The name comes from a Maori legend that the sun god - male - loved the moon goddess - female. They never could see each another due to the planets positions. One day the moon goddess came to earth to see the sun god, knowing the risks, was turned to stone as the daylight came. Hers was the ultimate expression of love. Te Aroha in Maori. This is why on the Kaimai Range, to the right of Mt Te Aroha is a high skyline silhouetted rock that from afar is shaped as a woman. It is known locally as the rock of Hinemoa.

Within the Kaimai Ranges the Hendersons Tramline loop track follows the route of bush tramlines and haul lines once used to extract logs from the bush. The walk includes forest and clearings near the fringe of the park. A side track off the main walk leads down to the base of a waterfall and a large swimming hole.
Also some 10-16km, on the Gordon backroad from te Aroha is a four-wheel drive track named Thomsons track, that takes venturers from the foothills around manawaru to the ranges top, where a large swimming hole is present.

==Geology==
The Kaimai Range is the result of a fault that uplifted primarily [[andesite|andesitic]] rocks from long-extinct volcanoes. This fault has not been active for about 140,000 years and started more than a million years ago.

==Demographics==
{{Historical populations|2006|1,701|2013|1,752|2018|2,028|percentages=pagr|source=<ref name="Census 2018"/>}}
The statistical area of Kaimai, which is 328 square kilometres but does not cover the entire range, had a population of 2,028 at the [[2018 New Zealand census]], an increase of 276 people (15.8%) since the [[2013 New Zealand census|2013 census]], and an increase of 327 people (19.2%) since the [[2006 New Zealand census|2006 census]].

==Kaimai Tunnel==
The [[Kaimai Tunnel|Kaimai Railway Tunnel]] runs for nearly nine kilometres under the range, making it the longest tunnel in New Zealand. Construction of the tunnel started from both sides of the range in 1969: the headings met in 1976 and the tunnel opened on 12 September 1978. The Kaimai Range and this tunnel led to a [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] [[railcar]] service between Auckland and Tauranga being named the [[Kaimai Express (train)|Kaimai Express]]. This service operated from 1991 until 2001.

A peak of the Kaimai directly above the tunnel, previously unnamed, was named Stokes Peak in 2010 in honour of geographer [[Evelyn Stokes]].<ref>[http://www.linz.govt.nz/placenames/consultation-decisions/a-to-z/stokes-peak/index.aspx Stokes Peak] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085701/http://www.linz.govt.nz/placenames/consultation-decisions/a-to-z/stokes-peak/index.aspx |date=2014-01-10 }}, [[Land Information New Zealand]], retrieved 2010-09-09.</ref>

==Flight 441 disaster==
At approximately 9:09 am on 3 July 1963 the [[DC-3]] Skyliner ZK-AYZ Hastings operating [[New Zealand National Airways Corporation Flight 441]] from [[Whenuapai Airport]], [[Auckland]] to Tauranga crashed into the range. All 23 aboard died, making it the worst air disaster in mainland New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10545462|title=New Zealand's worst air disasters |date=28 November 2008|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19630703-0|title=Accident description|publisher=Aviation Safety Network|accessdate=2009-01-21}}</ref>

==Communications==
The [[New Zealand Post Office]] engineering division (radio) built and maintained a [[microwave communications]] facility near the top of Kaimai range, close to the [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]]–[[Tauranga]] highway saddle. In the 1960s it was a [[Lenkurt]] relay as part of the national network, linking [[Sanitorium Hill]] near [[Cambridge, New Zealand|Cambridge]] to [[Rotorua]], with a spur to Tauranga. It now has cell phone and various other radio communications facilities, and is owned and operated by [[Telecom New Zealand]].

[[Airways New Zealand]] maintains a [[Secondary Surveillance Radar]] installation on ''Te Weraiti'', a peak on the Kaimai range, 5 kilometers north of the State Highway 29 saddle. This is used to facilitate [[air traffic control]] of [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]] equipped aircraft in the area.
