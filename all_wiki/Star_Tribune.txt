The '''''Star Tribune''''' is the largest [[newspaper]] in [[Minnesota]]. It originated as the ''Minneapolis Tribune'' in 1867 and the competing ''Minneapolis Daily Star'' in 1920. During the 1930s and 1940s Minneapolis's competing newspapers were consolidated, with the ''Tribune'' published in the morning and the ''Star'' in the evening. They merged in 1982, creating the ''Star and Tribune'', and it was renamed to ''Star Tribune'' in 1987. After a tumultuous period in which the newspaper was sold and re-sold and filed for [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] protection in 2009, it was purchased by local businessman [[Glen Taylor]] in 2014.

The ''Star Tribune'' serves [[Minneapolis]] and is distributed throughout the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul]] metropolitan area, the state of Minnesota and the [[Upper Midwest]]. It typically contains a mixture of national, international and local news, sports, business and lifestyle content. Journalists from the ''Star Tribune'' and its predecessor newspapers have won six [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, most recently winning two in 2013. The newspaper's headquarters is in downtown Minneapolis. Its distribution is ranked [[List of newspapers in the United States#Top 10 newspapers by circulation|7th in the United States]].

==History==

===''Minneapolis Tribune''===
The ''Star Tribune''{{'s}} roots date to the creation of the ''Minneapolis Daily Tribune'' by Colonel [[William S. King]], [[William D. Washburn]], and [[Dorilus Morrison]]; the ''Tribune''{{'s}} first issue was published on May 25, 1867. The newspaper went through several different editors and publishers during its first two decades, including John T. Gilman, George K. Shaw, [[Albert Shaw (journalist)|Albert Shaw]], and [[Alden J. Blethen]]. In 1878 the ''Minneapolis Evening Journal'' began publication, giving the ''Tribune'' its first competition. On November 30, 1889, the ''Tribune'' headquarters in downtown Minneapolis caught fire. Seven people were killed and 30 injured, and the building and presses were a total loss.<ref name=morison>{{cite book |last1 = Morison |first1 = Bradley |title = Sunlight on Your Doorstep: The Minneapolis Tribune's First Hundred Years |date = 1966 |publisher = Ross & Haines |location = Minneapolis }}</ref>{{rp|3, 10–14}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn00058008/|title=About  Star tribune. (Minneapolis, MN) 1999-current|website=Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=January 24, 2020}}</ref>

In 1891, the ''Tribune'' was purchased by [[Gilbert A. Pierce]] and William J. Murphy for $450,000 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US-GDP|450000|1891|r=-3}}}} in {{inflation-year| US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}). Pierce quickly sold his share to [[Thomas Lowry]] and Lowry sold it to Murphy, making Murphy the newspaper's sole owner. His business and legal background helped him structure the ''Tribune''{{'s}} debt and modernize its printing equipment. The newspaper experimented with partial-color printing and the use of [[halftone]] for photographs and portraits. In 1893, Murphy sent the ''Tribune''{{'s}} first correspondent to [[Washington, D.C.]] As Minneapolis grew, the newspaper's circulation expanded; the ''Tribune'' and the ''Evening Journal'' were closely competitive, with the smaller ''Minneapolis Times'' in third place. In 1905, Murphy bought out the ''Times'' and merged it with the ''Tribune''.<ref name=morison/>{{rp|15–18}}

He died in 1918, endowing a [[University of Minnesota School of Journalism and Mass Communication|school of journalism at the University of Minnesota]]. After a brief transitional period, Murphy's son Fred became the ''Tribune''{{'s}} publisher in 1921.<ref name=morison/>{{rp|23, 29}}

===''Minneapolis Daily Star''===
The other half of the newspaper's history begins with the ''Minnesota Daily Star,'' which was founded on August 19, 1920, by elements of the agrarian [[Nonpartisan League]] and backed by [[Thomas Van Lear]] and Herbert Gaston. The ''Daily Star'' had difficulty attracting advertisers with its overt political agenda, and went bankrupt in 1924. After its purchase by A. B. Frizzell and former ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' executive John Thompson, the newspaper became the politically independent ''Minneapolis Daily Star''.<ref name=morison/>{{rp|55–56}}<ref name=minnpost>{{cite web |last1 = Nathanson |first1 = Iric |title = 'Newspaper with a Soul': The Short-Lived ''Minnesota Daily Star'' launched in 1920 |url = https://www.minnpost.com/media/2015/03/newspaper-soul-short-lived-minnesota-daily-star-launched-1920 |website = [[MinnPost]] }}</ref>

===Cowles era===
[[File:John Cowles-194101-cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|alt=Smiling man in round-rimmed glasses|''Star'' manager John Cowles, Sr.]]

In 1935, the Cowles family of [[Des Moines, Iowa]], purchased the ''Star.'' The family patriarch, [[Gardner Cowles, Sr.]], had purchased ''[[The Des Moines Register]]'' and the ''[[Des Moines Tribune]]'' during the first decade of the century and managed them successfully. Gardner's son, [[John Cowles, Sr.]] (1898–1983), moved to Minneapolis to manage the ''Star''. Under him it had the city's highest circulation, pressuring Minneapolis's other newspapers. In 1939 the Cowles family purchased the ''Minneapolis Evening Journal'', merging the two newspapers into the ''Star-Journal''. ''Tribune'' publisher Fred Murphy died in 1940; the following year the Cowles family bought the ''Tribune'' and merged it with their company, giving it ownership of the city's major newspapers. The ''Tribune'' became the city's morning newspaper, the ''Star-Journal'' (renamed the ''Star'' in 1947) was the evening newspaper, and they published a joint Sunday edition. A separate evening newspaper (the ''Times'') was spun off, which published until 1948.<ref name=morison/>{{rp|57–62}}<ref name=stribtimeline>{{cite web |title = Timeline: A Look at History of ''Star Tribune'' |url = http://www.startribune.com/timeline-a-look-at-history-of-star-tribune/264439631/#1 |website = Star Tribune }}</ref>

In 1944, John Cowles, Sr., hired [[Wisconsin]] native and former ''[[Tulsa Tribune]]'' editor [[William P. Steven]] as managing editor of the two newspapers; Steven became vice president and executive editor in 1954. During his tenure in Minneapolis, he was president of the Associated Press Managing Editors Association in 1949 and first chairman of the organization's Continuing Study Committee. By August 1960 [[John Cowles, Jr.]], was vice president and associate editor of the two papers, and it was soon apparent that he disapproved of Steven's hard-nosed approach to journalism. When Steven chafed under the younger Cowles's management, he was fired.<ref name="Lubbock">{{cite web |url = https://newspaperarchive.com/us/texas/lubbock/avalanche-journal/1960/09-20/page-39 |title = Minneapolis Man Gets Houston Post |work = [[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]] |date = September 20, 1960 |access-date = June 14, 2014 |pages = 39 |via = [[NewspaperArchive.com]] }}</ref><ref name="TIME-1960">{{cite web |url = http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939222,00.html |title = The Press: Let History Try |work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date = August 29, 1960 |access-date = October 10, 2011 }}</ref>

After Steven's ouster, John Cowles, Jr., was editor of the two newspapers; he became president in 1968 and editorial chairman the following year. He had a progressive political viewpoint, publishing editorials supporting the [[civil rights movement]] and liberal causes.<ref name=cowlesobit>{{cite news |last1 = Royce |first1 = Gradon |title = Publisher John Cowles Jr., who Shaped the Twin Cities for 50 Years, Dies |url = http://www.startribune.com/publisher-john-cowles-jr-who-shaped-the-twin-cities-for-50-years-dies/143100356/ |work = Minneapolis Star Tribune |date = March 19, 2012 }}</ref>

In 1982 the afternoon ''Star'' was discontinued due to dwindling circulation, a trend common for afternoon newspapers. The two papers were merged into a single morning paper, the ''Minneapolis Star and Tribune''. Cowles, Jr., fired publisher [[Donald R. Dwight]]. His handling of Dwight's termination led to his removal as editor in 1983, although his family retained a controlling financial interest in the newspaper.<ref name=cowlesobit/>

In 1983, the ''Star and Tribune'' challenged a Minnesota tax on paper and ink before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. In ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune Co. v. Commissioner]]'', the court found that the tax (which targeted specific newspapers) was a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Minneapolis Star & Tribune Company v. Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue |url = https://www.oyez.org/cases/1982/81-1839 |via = Oyez }}</ref> In 1987 the newspaper's name was simplified to ''Star Tribune'', and the slogan "Newspaper of the Twin Cities" was added.<ref name=stribtimeline/>

==={{anchor|Recent history}}1998 to present===
In 1998 [[the McClatchy Company]] purchased [[Cowles Media Company]] for $1.4 billion (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US-GDP|1400000000|1998}}}} in {{inflation-year| US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}), ending the newspaper's 61-year history in the family in one of the largest sales in American newspaper history. Although McClatchy sold many of Cowles's smaller assets, it kept the ''Star Tribune'' for several years. On December 26, 2006, McClatchy sold the paper to private equity firm [[Avista Capital Partners]] for $530 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US-GDP|530000000|2006}}}} in {{inflation-year| US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}), less than half of what it had paid for Cowles eight years earlier.<ref name=mcclatchysale>{{cite news |title = McClatchy in $1.4 Billion Cowles Deal |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/14/business/the-media-business-mcclatchy-in-1.4-billion-cowles-deal.html |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = November 14, 1997 }}</ref><ref name="WSJ27DEC06">{{cite web |url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116717230686359894 |title = McClatchy's Minneapolis Sale Aids Web Efforts |work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] |date = December 26, 2006 |access-date = June 14, 2014 |last = Ellison |first = Sarah }}</ref>

In March 2007 Par Ridder was appointed ''Star Tribune'' publisher after his predecessor, J. Keith Moyer, left the newspaper after the sale.<ref name="ST_Par_Ridder">{{cite web |url = http://www.startribune.com/business/11216341.html |title = Par Ridder named ''Star Tribune'' CEO, publisher |work = Star Tribune |date = March 5, 2007 |access-date = June 4, 2008 |last = McKinney |first = Matt }}</ref> Ridder is a member of the Ridder family, which had owned [[Knight Ridder]] (publishers of several newspapers, including the rival ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]''). Ridder's arrival resulted in litigation when it was discovered that he had stolen a hard drive containing information about employees and advertisers which the ''Pioneer Press'' called "[[trade secret]]s". Ridder also took two high-ranking staff members with him to the Minneapolis paper, which raised eyebrows since such employees usually have [[non-compete clause]]s in their contracts. On September 18, 2007, Ridder was removed from his post by a Ramsey County judge,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.mprnews.org/story/2007/09/18/ridderruling |title = Judge Critical of Par Ridder's Conduct in Ruling |publisher = [[Minnesota Public Radio]] |date = September 18, 2007 |access-date = June 14, 2014 |last = Stawicki |first = Elizabeth }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.twincities.com/ci_8140842 |title = ''Star Tribune'' to Put Headquarters, Other Land up for Sale |work = [[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] |date = February 1, 2008 |access-date = February 1, 2008 |last = Welbes |first = John }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/stories/2008/01/28/daily45.html |title = ''Star Tribune'' Trying to Sell Headquarters |publisher = [[American City Business Journals]] |work = Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal |date = February 1, 2008 |access-date = February 1, 2008 |last = Orrick |first = Natasha R. }}</ref> and he resigned on December 7.<ref name=publisher-200712 />

On January 15, 2009, the paper, the country's 15th-largest daily, filed for bankruptcy under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2009/01/star-tribune-files-bankruptcy-and-lists-unsecured-creditors |title = ''Star Tribune'' Files for Bankruptcy and Lists Unsecured Creditors |work = MinnPost |date = January 15, 2009 |access-date = June 14, 2014 |last = Schmickle |first = Sharon }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aWeifv3njDqo |title = Star Tribune Files for Bankruptcy After Ads Decline |work = [[Bloomberg News]] |date = January 16, 2009 |access-date = June 14, 2014 |last = Kary |first = Tiffany }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Article/Economist-Avista-Has-Only-Itself-To-Blame-In-Strib-Bankruptcy |title = Economist: Avista Has Only Itself to Blame In 'Strib' Bankruptcy |work = [[Editor & Publisher]] |date = January 16, 2009 |access-date = June 14, 2014 |last = Fitzgerald |first = Mark }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/business/worldbusiness/16iht-press.4.19434179.html |title = Bankruptcy for Another U.S. Paper |work = [[International Herald Tribune]] |date = January 6, 2009 |access-date = June 14, 2014 |last = Pérez-Peña |first = Richard }}</ref> On September 17 the [[United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York]] approved a bankruptcy plan for the ''Star Tribune'', which emerged from bankruptcy protection on September 28.

==Editions==
After the 1987 formation of the ''Star Tribune'', the newspaper was published in three editions: one for Minneapolis and the western suburbs, one for St. Paul and the eastern suburbs and a state edition for Minnesota and the Midwest. The St. Paul edition was discontinued in 1999 in favor of a metro edition for the Minneapolis–St. Paul area and a state edition for areas beyond the metropolitan area.<ref>{{cite news |last1 = McGuire |first1 = Tim |title = Newspaper Aims to Serve the Entire Metro Area, not Pieces of It |work = Star Tribune |date = December 12, 1999 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Desky |first1 = Mark |title = Twin Cities Paper Changes Name, Distribution |journal = AdWeek |date = July 27, 1987 |page = 43 }}</ref>

Although the newspaper competes with the St. Paul-based ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press|Pioneer Press]]'' in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area, the ''Star Tribune'' is more popular in the western metropolitan area and the ''Pioneer Press'' more popular in the eastern metro area. The newspapers share some printing and delivery operations.<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Brauer |first1 = David |title = Mapping the Newspaper War, 25 Years After the ''Star Tribune'' Invaded ''Pioneer Press'' Turf |url = https://www.minnpost.com/braublog/2012/10/mapping-newspaper-war-25-years-after-star-tribune-invaded-pioneer-press-turf |website = MinnPost }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1 = Collins |first1 = Bob |title = Combining Delivery, PiPress and Strib Get Cozier |url = http://blogs.mprnews.org/newscut/2015/06/combining-delivery-pipress-and-strib-get-cozier/ |publisher = Minnesota Public Radio }}</ref>

Special weekly sections include Taste (restaurants and cooking), travel, Outdoors Weekend and Science + Health. The Sunday edition has a larger editorial and opinion section, Opinion Exchange.

After the city's newspapers were consolidated by the Cowles family, their offices were gradually moved to the former the ''Daily Star'' headquarters in downtown Minneapolis. The building was renovated in 1939–1940, and expanded in a larger renovation from 1946 to 1949. After 1949, the building housed the offices and presses of the ''Star'' and the ''Tribune.'' During the 1980s an annex, the Freeman Building, was built across the street from the headquarters and connected with a [[skyway]].<ref>{{cite web |title = A Eulogy: The Minneapolis Star-Tribune Building |url = http://hclib.tumblr.com/post/134675224041/a-eulogy-the-minneapolis-star-tribune-building |website = Hennepin County Library Special Collections Tumblr }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1 = Lileks |first1 = James |title = Streetscapes: ''Star Tribune'' Is Last of Minneapolis Newspaper Buildings |url = http://www.startribune.com/star-tribune-is-last-of-downtown-minneapolis-newspaper-buildings/297050891/ |work = Star Tribune |date = March 21, 2015 }}</ref> In 1987, the Star Tribune opened a new, $110 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US-GDP|110000000|1987}}}} in {{inflation-year| US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}) printing plant, called the Heritage Center, in a historic [[warehouse district]] on the northern edge of downtown Minneapolis.
