Haddad was announced as [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]]'s running mate in the [[2018 Brazilian general election|2018 presidential election]] in August 2018. However, the [[Superior Electoral Court]] ruled on 31 August that the former president is ineligible for candidacy due to his being disqualified under the [[Ficha Limpa|Clean Slate]] law, which bans people convicted on appeal from running for public office. Lula had been arrested in April after his conviction for corruption was upheld by the Federal Court of the Fourth Region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2018/noticia/2018/08/31/maioria-dos-ministros-do-tse-vota-pela-rejeicao-da-candidatura-de-lula.ghtml|title=TSE decide por 6 votos a 1 rejeitar a candidatura de Lula a presidente|publisher=}}</ref> On 11 September 2018, Haddad was named by the Workers' Party as Lula's replacement, with [[Communist Party of Brazil|Communist Party]] legislator [[Manuela d'Ávila]] taking Haddad's place as the vice presidential candidate.<ref name=WSJ>{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazils-da-silva-to-step-aside-name-haddad-as-replacement-candidate-1536686437|title=Brazil's da Silva Steps Aside, Names Haddad as Replacement Candidate|journal=Wall Street Journal|first1=Jeffrey T.|last1=Lewis|first2=Luciana|last2=Magalhaes|date=11 September 2018|via=www.wsj.com}}</ref>
