The '''2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference''', commonly known as the '''Copenhagen Summit''', was held at the [[Bella Center]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], between 7 and 18 December. The conference included the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and the 5th Meeting of the Parties (MOP 5) to the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. According to the [[Bali Road Map]], a framework for [[climate change mitigation]] beyond 2012 was to be agreed there.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iisd.ca/upcoming/linkagesmeetings.asp?id=5 |title=IISD Reporting Services – Upcoming meetings |publisher=Iisd.ca |accessdate=8 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212101150/http://www.iisd.ca/upcoming/linkagesmeetings.asp?id=5 |archive-date=12 December 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Background and lead-up==

The conference was preceded by the [[Climate Change: Global Risks, Challenges and Decisions]] scientific conference, which took place in March 2009 and was also held at the Bella Center. The negotiations began to take a new format when in May 2009 UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]] attended the World Business Summit on Climate Change in Copenhagen, organised by the [[Copenhagen Climate Council]] (COC), where he requested that COC councillors attend New York's Climate Week at the Summit on Climate Change on 22 September and engage with heads of government on the topic of the climate problem.<ref>{{citation|author=Tim Flannery |publisher=[[The Monthly]] |date=November 2009 |title=Copenhagen and Beyond: Conference Bound |url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/monthly-essays-tim-flannery-copenhagen-and-beyond-conference-bound-2110 |accessdate=8 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506043909/http://www.themonthly.com.au/monthly-essays-tim-flannery-copenhagen-and-beyond-conference-bound-2110 |archivedate=6 May 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Negotiating position of the European Union==

On 28 January 2009, the [[European Commission]] released a position paper, "Towards a comprehensive climate agreement in Copenhagen."<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/09/34&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |title=Questions and Answers on the Communication Towards a comprehensive climate change agreement in Copenhagen |publisher=European Union |date=28 January 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218075503/http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO%2F09%2F34&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en |archivedate=18 February 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> The position paper "addresses three key challenges: targets and actions; financing [of "low-carbon development and adaptation"]; and building an effective [[global carbon market]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/pdf/future_action/communication.pdf |title=Towards a comprehensive climate agreement in Copenhagen |publisher=European Union| accessdate= 8 April 2010}}</ref>

Leading by example, the European Union had committed to implementing binding legislation, even without a satisfactory deal in Copenhagen. Last December, the European Union revised its carbon allowances system called the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)]] designed for the post-Kyoto period (after 2013). This new stage of the system aims at further reducing greenhouse gases emitted in Europe in a binding way and at showing the commitments the EU had already done before the Copenhagen meeting. To avoid carbon leakage—relocation of companies in other regions not complying with similar legislation—the EU Commission will foresee that sectors exposed to international competition, should be granted some free allocations of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions provided that they are at least at the same level of a benchmark. Other sectors should buy such credits on an international market. Energy intensive industries in Europe have advocated for this benchmark system in order to keep funds in investment capacities for low carbon products rather than for speculations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1kf_axslfk |title=Jumping the climate change hurdle |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=9 December 2009}}</ref> The European chemical industry claims here the need to be closer to the needs of citizens in a sustainable way. To comply with such commitments for a [[low-carbon economy]], this requires competitiveness and innovations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpmXY0R7RLQ |title=Building Blocks for Climate Change Solutions |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=9 December 2009}}</ref>

The French Minister for Ecology [[Jean-Louis Borloo]] pushes the creation of the "Global Environment Organisation" as France's main institutional contribution, to offer a powerful alternative to the [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]].

It was discussed at a series of meetings before Copenhagen.

===Bonn – second negotiating meeting===

Delegates from 183 countries met in [[Bonn]] from 1 to 12 June 2009. The purpose was to discuss key negotiating texts. These served as the basis for the international climate change agreement at Copenhagen. At the conclusion the Ad Hoc Working Group under the Kyoto Protocol ([[AWG-KP]]) negotiating group was still far away from the emission reduction range that has been set out by science to [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid the worst ravages of climate change]]: a minus 25% to minus 40% reduction below 1990 levels by 2020. The AWG-KP still needs to decide on the aggregate emission reduction target for industrialised countries, along with individual targets for each country. Progress was made in gaining clarification of the issues of concern to parties and including these concerns in the updated draft of the negotiating text.<ref name="Bonn">{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/files/press/news_room/press_releases_and_advisories/application/pdf/091206_closing_pr_sb30.pdf|title=Progress Made in Negotiations for Ambitious and Effective Copenhagen Deal at Bonn UNFCCC Meeting|date=12 June 2009|work=Press Release|publisher=UNFCCC/CCNUCC|page=2|accessdate=15 June 2009}}</ref>

===Seventh session===

====Bangkok====

The first part of the seventh session of the AWG-LCA was held in Bangkok, Thailand, from Monday, 28 September until 9 October, at the [[United Nations Conference Centre (Bangkok)|United Nations Conference Centre]] (UNCC) of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (UNESCAP), [[Bangkok]], Thailand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/meetings/intersessional/bangkok_09/items/4967.php |title=Bangkok Climate Change Talks – 2009 |publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |accessdate=7 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109222317/http://unfccc.int/meetings/intersessional/bangkok_09/items/4967.php |archivedate=9 November 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

====Barcelona====

The resumed session was held in [[Barcelona, Spain]], from 2 to 6 November 2009. Thereafter, the AWG-LCA met to conclude its work at its eighth session, concurrently with the fifteenth session of the Conference of the Parties which opened in Copenhagen on 7 December 2009.

During the conference some countries stated what actions they were proposing to take if a binding agreement was achieved. In the end, no such agreement was reached and the actions will instead be debated in 2010. Listing by country or political union. Sections in alphabetic order, table according to higher objectives.

====Technology Action Programs====
Technology Action Programs (TAPs) have been proposed as a means for organizing future technology efforts under the UNFCCC. By creating programs for a set of adaptation and mitigation technologies, the UNFCCC would send clear signals to the private and finance sector, governments, research institutions as well as citizens of the world looking for solutions to the climate problem. Potential focus areas for TAPs include early warning systems, expansion of [[halophyte|salinity-tolerant]] crops, electric vehicles, wind and solar energy, efficient energy grid systems, and other technologies.<ref>http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2008/smsn/ngo/071.pdf</ref>

===Danish Text===
A leaked document known as "The Danish Text" has started an argument between developed and developing nations. The document was subtitled as "The Copenhagen Agreement" and proposes measures to keep average global temperature rises to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. [[Developing countries]] reacted to the document by saying that the [[developed country|developed countries]] had worked behind closed doors and made an agreement according to their wish without the consent of the developing nations. [[Lumumba Di-Aping|Lumumba Stanislaus Di-Aping]], chairman of the [[Group of 77|G77]], said, "It's an incredibly imbalanced text intended to subvert, absolutely and completely, two years of negotiations.

==="Tuvalu Protocol"===
{{main|Tuvalu and the United Nations}}
The Tuvaluan delegation, led by Ian Fry, played an active role in the Conference, attracting media attention. The country submitted a proposed protocol which would have imposed deeper, legally binding emissions cuts, including on developing nations. The proposal -dubbed by the media and by NGOs as the "Tuvalu Protocol"- was "immediately supported by other small island states, including [[Grenada]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and several African states", but opposed by countries including China, [[India]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]. The disagreement caused a suspension in negotiations, and prompted supportive campaign groups to "demonstrate[...] outside the meeting in favour of Tuvalu, chanting: 'Tuvalu is the new deal.'"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/09/copenhagen-tuvalu-protocol-split "Copenhagen talks break down as developing nations split over 'Tuvalu' protocol"], ''The Guardian'', 9 December 2009</ref><ref name="Milne">[http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/27620.html "Dispatches from Copenhagen"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401114530/http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/27620.html |date=1 April 2011 }}, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 18 December 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/pacbeat/stories/200912/s2768166.htm "Tuvalu Copenhagen delegate angered"], ABC Radio Australia, 10 December 2009</ref> Tuvalu's position was supported by, among others, [[East Timor]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Vanuatu]], and by Papua New Guinean chief negotiator [[Kevin Conrad]].<ref>[http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=4750 "David and Goliath Showdown at Copenhagen Talks – Tuvalu & PNG Refuse to Bow Down"], ''Solomon Times'', 11 December 2009</ref> Tuvalu and its representative Ian Fry "were the toast of the thousands of environmentalists at the conference, who held a noisy demonstration in support of the island state's position".<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/climate/tuvalu-call-for-copenhagen-protocol-splits-developing-nation-bloc/story-e6frg6xf-1225808881276 "Tuvalu call for Copenhagen Protocol splits developing nation bloc"], ''The Australian'', 10 December 2009</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8405051.stm "Copenhagen denies Tuvalu bid for tough climate controls"], British Broadcasting Corporation, 9 December 2009</ref> In an article entitled "You caused it, you fix it: Tuvalu takes off the gloves", ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' noted that, by asking for a protocol that would legally bind developing countries, Tuvalu had "cracked a diplomatic axiom that has prevailed since the UN climate convention came into being in 1992: rich countries caused global warming, and it was their responsibility to fix it".<ref>[https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/you-caused-it-you-fix-it-tuvalu-takes-off-the-gloves-20091210-kksq.html "You caused it, you fix it: Tuvalu takes off the gloves"], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 10 December 2009</ref> ''[[The Economic Times]]'' in India noted that the Tuvaluan proposal had " take[n] centre stage", holding up proceedings for two consecutives days until it was rejected due to opposition from larger nations.<ref>[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2009-12-11/news/27657589_1_tuvalu-kyoto-protocol-connie-hedegaard "Copenhagen summit: Tuvalu holds up talks, proposal hangs fire"], ''Economic Times'', 11 December 2009</ref> Australian Senator [[Christine Milne]] described Tuvalu as "the mouse that roared" at the Conference.<ref name="Milne" /> Fry refused to support the [[Copenhagen Accord|final agreement]] reached by the Conference, describing it as "[[30 pieces of silver]] to betray our future and our people",<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/environment/copenhagen-chaos-as-talks-fail-20091219-l6r5.html "Copenhagen chaos as talks fail"], ''The Age'', 20 December 2009</ref> after delivering a final plea in a speech with tears in his eyes, concluding "The fate of my country rests in your hands".

===Negotiating problems===
On 16 December, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the summit in Copenhagen was in jeopardy. "We have made no progress" said a source close to the talks. "What people don't realise is that we are now not really ready for the leaders. These talks are now 17 hours late." Negotiators were openly talking of the best possible outcome being a "weak political agreement that would leave no clear way forward to tackle rising greenhouse gas emissions". This would mean that negotiations would continue into 2010 increasing the damage done by emissions.<ref name="guard16">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/16/copenhagen-summit-miliband-farce-warning |title=Copenhagen summit veering towards farce, warns Ed Miliband |last=Vidal |first=John |author2=Allegra Stratton |date=16 December 2009 |work=The Guardian|accessdate=18 December 2009 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106051023/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/16/copenhagen-summit-miliband-farce-warning |archivedate=6 January 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On 18 December, the head of the [[United Nations Environmental Program]] told the BBC that "the summit as of this morning is a summit in crisis" and that only the arrival of heads of state could bring the summit to a successful conclusion.

Earlier proposals, that would have aimed to limit temperature rises to 1.5&nbsp;°C and cut {{co2}} emissions by 80% by 2050 were dropped.

==Analysis and aftermath==
Despite widely held expectations that the Copenhagen summit would produce a legally binding treaty, the conference was plagued by negotiating deadlock and the resulting "Copenhagen Accord" which is not legally enforceable. BBC environment analyst [[Roger Harrabin]] attributed the failure of the summit to live up to expectations to a number of factors including the recent [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|global recession]] and conservative domestic pressure in the US and China.<ref name="Harrabin">{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8423822.stm|title=Harrabin's Notes: After Copenhagen|publisher=BBC | date=21 December 2009| accessdate=26 March 2010}}</ref>

Gregg Easterbrook described the Copenhagen Accord as "vague, nonbinding comments about how other people should use less fossil fuel". According to Easterbrook, international climate change negotiations are "complex, expensive and goin' nowhere" and are prone to creating the appearance of action while distracting attention from the lack of real change.<ref name='ebrook'/>

In the week following the end of the Copenhagen summit, carbon prices in the EU dropped to a six-month low.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8425293.stm

The Copenhagen Accord asked countries to submit emissions targets by the end of January 2010, and paves the way for further discussions to occur at the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2010 UN climate change conference]] in Mexico and the mid-year session in [[Bonn]].

===Failure blamed on developed countries===
[[George Monbiot]] blamed the failure of the conference to achieve a binding deal on the United States Senate and [[Barack Obama]]. By negotiating the Copenhagen Accord with only a select group of nations, most of the UN member states were excluded. If poorer nations did not sign the Accord then they would be unable to access funds from richer nations to help them adapt to climate change. He noted how the British and American governments have both blamed China for the failure of the talks but said that Obama placed China in "an impossible position" – "He demanded concessions while offering nothing."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/21/copenhagen-failure-us-senate-vested-interests|title=If you want to know who's to blame for Copenhagen, look to the US Senate|last=Monbiot|first=George|date=21 December 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 December 2009| location=London}}</ref> [[Martin Khor]] blamed Denmark for convening a meeting of only 26 nations in the final two days of the conference. He says that it undermined the UN's multilateral and democratic process of climate negotiations. It was in these meetings that China vetoed long-term emission-reduction goals for global emissions to decrease by 50%, and developed countries emissions to fall by 80% by 2050 compared to 1990. Khor states that this is when other countries began to blame the failures on China. If China had accepted this, by 2050 their emissions per capita would have had to be around one half to one fifth per capita of those of the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/28/copenhagen-denmark-china |title=Blame Denmark, not China, for Copenhagen failure |last=Khor |first=Martin |date=28 December 2009 |work=The Guardian|accessdate=28 December 2009 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231005758/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/28/copenhagen-denmark-china |archivedate=31 December 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>

: "...the NGO movement is ten years out of date. They’re still arguing for 'climate justice', whatever that means, which is interpreted by the big developing countries like India and China as a right to pollute up to Western levels. To me carbon equity is the logic of mutually assured destruction. I think NGOs are far too soft on the Chinese, given that it’s the world’s biggest polluter, and is the single most important factor in deciding when global emissions will peak, which in turn is the single most important factor in the eventual temperature outcome...

:"I think the bottom line for China is growth, and given that this growth is mainly based on coal, there is going to have to be much more pressure on China if global emissions are to peak within any reasonable time frame. In Beijing the interests of the Party come first, second and third, and global warming is somewhere further down the list. Growth delivers stability and prosperity, and keeps the party in power."<ref>{{Citation|title=Views on China's Role in the Greenhouse |author=Andrew Revkin |url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/views-on-china-and-copenhagen/ |website=The New York Times |date=23 December 2009 |accessdate=8 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226161110/http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/views-on-china-and-copenhagen/ |archivedate=26 February 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Indian journalist [[Praful Bidwai]] puts the blame on both developed and a few developing countries such as India, arguing that the "Copenhagen Accord is an illegitimate, ill-conceived, collusive deal between a handful of countries that are some of the world's greatest present and future emitters."<ref>{{Citation |first=Praful |last=Bidwai |date=12 January 2010|title=Fouling up the Air|url=http://www.tni.org/article/fouling-air |publisher=The Transnational Institute | accessdate= 8 April 2010}}</ref> He argues that India's policy is driven by elites determined to maintain high-consumer lifestyles which will have devastating effects for the vast majority of India's poor.

===Media===
An article by Gerald Traufetter for [[Spiegel Online]] described the Copenhagen summit as a "political disaster," and asserted that the US and China "joined forces to stymie every attempt by European nations to reach agreement." Traufetter's assertion was based on his analysis of "leaked diplomatic cables."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,733630,00.html |title=The US and China Joined Forces Against Europe |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209013802/http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0%2C1518%2C733630%2C00.html |archivedate=9 December 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>
An article by Damian Carrington for [[guardian.co.uk]] also included an analysis of [[WikiLeaks]] US diplomatic cables. According to Carrington, "America used spying, threats and promises of aid to get support for [the] Copenhagen accord."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/03/wikileaks-us-manipulated-climate-accord |title=WikiLeaks cables reveal how US manipulated climate accord |work=The Guardian|date=3 December 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2010 |location=London |first=Damian |last=Carrington |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210021210/http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/03/wikileaks-us-manipulated-climate-accord |archivedate=10 December 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Müller is a programme director at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. In his view, the failure to get a better result at Copenhagen was due to a lack of political will in the months preceding the conference.

[[Walter Russell Mead]]{{clarify|date=June 2011|reason=what academic field is he in?}} argues that the conference failed because environmentalists have changed from "Bambi to Godzilla."  According to Mead, environmentalist used to represent the skeptical few who made valid arguments against big government programs which tried to impose simple but massive solutions on complex situations.  Environmentalists' more recent advocacy for big economic and social intervention against global warming, according to Mead, has made them, "the voice of the establishment, of the tenured, of the technocrats" and thus has lost them the support of a public which is increasingly skeptical of global warming.<ref>[[George Will|Will, George]], "[http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_15978060 When Bambi becomes Godzilla]", ''[[The Denver Post]]'', 5 September 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909234738/http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_15978060 |date=9 September 2010 }}</ref>

===Emissions reductions===
{{Main|Copenhagen Accord#Effect on emissions}}

A preliminary assessment published in November 2010 by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) suggests a possible "emissions gap" between the voluntary pledges made in the Copenhagen Accord and the emissions cuts necessary to have a "likely" (greater than 66% probability) chance of meeting the 2&nbsp;°C objective.<ref>{{cite book

The UNEP assessment takes the 2&nbsp;°C objective as being measured against the pre-industrial global mean temperature level. To having a likely chance of meeting the 2&nbsp;°C objective, assessed studies generally indicated the need for global emissions to peak before 2020, with substantial declines in emissions thereafter.

==US government spying==
{{Main |Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)#2014#January}}
In January 2014, it was revealed that the US government negotiators were in receipt of information during the conference that was being obtained by eavesdropping on meetings and other subterfuge against other conference delegations. Documents leaked by [[Edward Snowden]], and published by the Danish newspaper [[Dagbladet Information]], showed how the US [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) had monitored communications between countries before and during the conference, in order to provide the US negotiators with advance information about the positions of other parties at the conference.<ref name=Vidal2014>{{cite news|last=Vidal|first=John|title=Snowden revelations of NSA spying on Copenhagen climate talks spark anger|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jan/30/snowden-nsa-spying-copenhagen-climate-talks|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 January 2014|author2=Suzanne Goldenberg}}</ref><ref name="Geist/Moltke/Gjerding/Poitras2014">{{cite news|last=Poitras|first=Laura|title=For the NSA, espionage was a means to strengthen the US position in climate negotiations|url=http://www.information.dk/486360|accessdate=2 February 2014|newspaper=Dagbladet Information|date=30 January 2014|author2=Anton Geist|author3=Sebastian Gjerding|author4=Henrik Moltke}}</ref>

Representatives of other nations involved have reacted angrily. The leaked documents show that the NSA provided US delegates with advance details of the Danish plan to "rescue" the talks should they flounder, and also about China's efforts before the conference to coordinate its position with that of India. Members of the Danish negotiating team said that the US delegation was "peculiarly well-informed" about closed-door discussions that had taken place. "They simply sat back, just as we had feared they would if they knew about our document,"<ref name=Vidal2014/>
<ref name="Geist/Moltke/Gjerding/Poitras2014"/>

"The UN climate talks are supposed to be about building trust – that's been under threat for years because of the US backward position on climate action – these revelations will only crack that trust further," said Meena Raman, of [[Third World Network]]. "Fighting climate change is a global struggle, and these revelations clearly show that the US government is more interested in crassly protecting a few vested interests," said Brandon Wu of [[ActionAid]]. [[Bill McKibben]], founder of [[350.org]], called the spying by the US "insane and disgusting".<ref name=Vidal2014/>
