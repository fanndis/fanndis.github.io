The '''next United Kingdom general election''' is scheduled to be held on Thursday 2 May 2024, in line with the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|Fixed-term Parliaments Act]].

==Background==
The result at the last general election and the current situation in the House of Commons is given below:
{{UK House of Commons composition}}

==Electoral system==
{{See also|Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011}}
Provisionally, the next general election will be conducted using the [[2019 United Kingdom general election#Electoral system|same electoral system as the 2019 election]] ([[first-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]]).

The Conservative Party, which won a majority at the 2019 general election, included pledges in its manifesto to remove the fifteen-year limit on voting for British citizens living abroad, and to introduce a [[Voter Identification laws|voter identification requirement]]<ref name='conman'>{{cite web|url=https://vote.conservatives.com/our-plan|title=Our Plan - Conservative Manifesto 2019|work=Conservative Party|access-date=17 December 2019}}</ref> in Great Britain.

===Boundary review===
In March 2020, Cabinet Office minister [[Chloe Smith]] confirmed that the [[2021 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]] would commence based on retaining 650 seats.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmpubadm/correspondence/Correspondence-with-Chloe-Smith-MP-Minister-of-State-on-constituency-boundary-review-dated-24.30.3.20.pdf|title=Correspondence with Chloe Smith MP|publisher=parliament.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/26/mps-no-longer-to-get-automatic-vote-on-constituency-boundary-plans|title=MPs no longer to get automatic vote on constituency boundary plans|last=Proctor|first=Kate|date=26 March 2020|work=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The [[2021 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]] will begin in 2021 with the existing relevant legislation amended by the [[Parliamentary Constituencies Bill 2019-21]].

The postponed [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]] proposed reducing the number of constituencies from 650 to 600. In April 2016, each of the four parliamentary [[Boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commissions of the United Kingdom]] recommenced their review process.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boundary review launched|url=http://boundarycommissionforengland.independent.gov.uk/boundary-review-launched/|website=Boundary Commission for England|accessdate=30 October 2019|date=24 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bcomm-scotland.independent.gov.uk/reviews/2018-review|title=2018 Review of Westminster Parliamentary constituencies|publisher=Boundary Commission for Scotland|accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://bcomm-wales.gov.uk/taxonomy/term/3|title=2018 Review|publisher=Boundary Commission for Wales|accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref> A projection by [[Psephology|psephologists]] [[Colin Rallings]] and [[Michael Thrasher]] of how the 2017 votes would have translated to seats under the new boundaries suggested the changes would be beneficial to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and detrimental to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ian_a_jones/status/1039172363730870273|title=Ian Jones on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=30 October 2019|date=10 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.itv.com/news/2018-09-10/new-parliamentary-map-would-have-given-tories-a-majority-of-16-at-last-election/|title=New parliamentary map would have given Tories a majority of 16 at last election|work=ITV News|access-date=30 October 2019|date=10 September 2018}}</ref>

Boundary changes cannot be implemented until they are approved by both Houses of Parliament. No changes were submitted by the government during the 2017–2019 Parliament.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/boundaries-in-limbo/ |title=Boundaries in limbo: why the government cannot decide how many MPs there should be |last1=Johnston |first1=Ron |last2=Pattie |first2=Charles |last3=Rossiter |first3=David |publisher=[[London School of Economics]] |date=30 April 2019 |website=LSE British Politics and Policy |access-date=30 October 2019}}</ref> The majority Conservative government manifesto states that this will be implemented before the next general election.

==Date of the election==
The [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] (FTPA) introduced fixed-term parliaments to the United Kingdom, with elections scheduled on the first Thursday in May of the fifth year after the previous general election, unless the previous general election took place between 1 January and the first Thursday in May, in which case the election takes place on the first Thursday in May of the fourth year after the previous general election.<ref name="UKCLA">{{cite web|last1=Horne|first1=Alexander|last2=Kelly|first2=Richard|title=Alexander Horne and Richard Kelly: Prerogative powers and the Fixed-term Parliaments Act|url=http://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2014/11/19/alexander-horne-and-richard-kelly-prerogative-powers-and-the-fixed-term-parliaments-act/|publisher=UK Constitutional Law Association|website=ukconstitutionallaw.org|accessdate=30 October 2019|date=19 November 2014}}</ref>

Removing the power of the monarch, on advice of the prime minister, to dissolve parliament before its five-year maximum length,<ref name="UKCLA" /> the act permits early dissolution if the House of Commons votes by a two-thirds [[supermajority]]. Parliament is also dissolved if a government loses a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]] by a simple majority and a new government is not formed within 14 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100705/debtext/100705-0001.htm#10070511000001|title= House of Commons Debate 5 July 2010 c 23|date=5 July 2010|accessdate=30 October 2019|website=parliament.uk|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]}}</ref> Alternatively, a bill requiring just a simple majority in both Houses could be introduced to establish in law an earlier date for the election, which is how the date of the previous general election was set in 2019.<ref>{{cite news |title=MPs back December election |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50221856 |accessdate=30 October 2019 |date=29 October 2019}}</ref>

===Proposed repeal of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act===
At the 2019 general election, where the Conservatives won a majority of 80 seats, the manifesto of the party contained a commitment to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act due to "paralysis at a time when the country has needed decisive action".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/12/exit-poll-election-boris-johnson-jeremy-corbyn-labour|title=If the exit poll is right, this election will transform British politics|first=Martin|last=Kettle|date=12 December 2019|access-date=13 December 2019|work=The Guardian}}</ref> The pledge was confirmed in the first [[Queen's Speech]] following the election.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/12/full-transcript-the-queens-speech/|title=Full transcript: The Queen’s Speech|date=19 December 2019|accessdate=19 December 2019|work=The Spectator}}</ref> However, as the FTPA repealed [[Septennial Act 1716|the previous legislation]] in relation to limited term parliaments, further legislation would be required to set out how long parliaments should last.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nortonview.wordpress.com/2016/10/08/repealing-the-fixed-term-parliaments-act/|title=Repealing the Fixed-term Parliaments Act?|author-last=Norton|author-first=Philip|author-link=Philip Norton, Baron Norton of Louth|website=The Norton View|date=8 October 2016|accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref>
