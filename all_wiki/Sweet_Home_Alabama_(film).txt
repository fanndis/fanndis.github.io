==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->
On an Alabama beach, 10-year-olds Jake Perry and Melanie Smooter inspect the result of [[Fulgurite|lightning striking sand]]. Jake asserts that they will be married one day.

In the present day, Melanie is a successful fashion designer who has adopted the [[surname]] "Carmichael" to hide her poor Southern roots. After wealthy Andrew Hennings proposes, Melanie returns to Alabama to announce her engagement to her parents and finalize a divorce from her estranged husband, Jake. Meanwhile, Kate Hennings, Andrew's mother and the Mayor of New York City, doubts Melanie's suitability to wed her son, whom she is grooming to run for President of the United States.

Melanie visits Jake, who has avoided signing the divorce papers. After Jake orders Melanie out of his house, Melanie empties Jake's checking account, hoping to spur him into ending the marriage. Jake finally relents and agrees to the divorce and promises to return the signed papers the next morning. Later, at a local bar, Melanie gets drunk, insults her old school friends, and [[outing|outs]] her old childhood pal, Bobby Ray Bailey. The next morning, Melanie finds the signed document on her bed.

Melanie goes to the Carmichael plantation and apologizes to Bobby Ray. She is cornered there by Kate's assistant, sent there to gather information on Melanie's background. Bobby Ray backs up her pretense that she is a relative and the family mansion is her childhood home. Melanie reconciles with her friends and learns that after she split with Jake, he had followed her to New York to win her back. Intimidated by the city and her success, he returned home to make something of himself first. She and Jake have a heart-to-heart talk, and Melanie understands why he never signed their divorce papers.

Andrew arrives to surprise Melanie, but upon learning her true background and that Jake was her husband, he angrily leaves. He later returns, saying he still wants to marry Melanie, and the wedding is immediately set in motion. Melanie's New York friends arrive for the event. While visiting a nearby restaurant/resort with a [[glassblowing]] gallery, they admire the glass sculptures that are similar to ones they have seen in New York. Melanie realizes Jake is the artist and he owns the resort.

During Melanie and Andrew's wedding at the Carmichael estate, a lawyer arrives and halts the ceremony. He has the divorce papers, which Melanie has never signed. Melanie realizes she still loves Jake and cancels the wedding. She and Andrew wish each other well, though Kate berates Andrew and insults Melanie, her family, and the entire town, for which Melanie punches her in the jaw. Melanie finds Jake at the beach planting lightning rods in the sand during a rainstorm to create more glass sculptures. She says they are still married. They return to what would have been Melanie and Andrew's reception, and finally have their first dance as husband and wife.

A mid-credits sequence shows that they have a baby daughter, Melanie continues to thrive as a designer, and Jake opens a "Deep South Glass" franchise in New York. Andrew is engaged to a girl named Erin Vanderbilt.

===Casting===
[[Charlize Theron]] was considered for the lead role before Reese Witherspoon was cast.

Katherine Towne was cast as Witherspoon's character's assistant who ultimately ends up marrying the Patrick Dempsey character, but all other scenes were dropped in the final cut.

===Filming===
Although centered in a fictional version of the town of Pigeon Creek, near a fictional version of [[Greenville, Alabama]], the film was mostly shot in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The Carmichael Plantation, which Melanie tells the reporter is her childhood home, is the [[Oak Hill Berry Museum]], a historic landmark in Georgia which is on the campus of [[Berry College]] in [[Rome, Georgia]].

''Sweet Home Alabama'' was the first film allowed to shoot in New York City after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]]. It was also the first film ever allowed to film in [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany]]'s since ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany’s]]'' in 1961.

The streets and storefronts of [[Crawfordville, Georgia]] were used as the backdrop for the Catfish Festival and other downtown scenes. The coonhound cemetery was on Moore Street in Crawfordville and the bar was located at Heavy's Barbecue near the town. Glass that forms when lightning hits sand, as in the film, is called [[fulgurite]].

Jake's glassblowing shop was filmed at an old mill named Starr's Mill, in [[Fayette County, Georgia]]. Wynn's Pond in [[Sharpsburg, Georgia]] is the location where Jake lands his plane. The historic homes shown at Melanie's return to Pigeon Creek were shot in [[Eufaula, Alabama]].

The film title and theme song lyrics are from the "[[Sweet Home Alabama]]" song by [[Southern rock]] band [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], that first appeared in 1974 on their second album, ''[[Second Helping]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fame10.com/entertainment/7-things-you-didnt-know-about-sweet-home-alabama/|title=7 Things You Didn’t Know About Sweet Home Alabama|website=www.fame10.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2001/scene/people-news/katherine-towne-1117854784/|title=Katherine Towne|first1=Jill|last1=Feiwell|magazine=Variety|date=October 24, 2001}}</ref>

The site's critics consensus reads: "Reese Witherspoon is charming enough, but the road to Alabama is well-traveled."<ref name="RottenTomatoes">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sweet_home_alabama |title=Sweet Home Alabama (2002) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |access-date=July 4, 2019}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sweet-home-alabama |title=Sweet Home Alabama Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |access-date=July 4, 2019}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]], critic for the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]],'' awarded it three-out-of-four stars, commenting, "It is a fantasy, a sweet, light-hearted fairy tale with Reese Witherspoon at its center. She is as lovable as [[Doris Day]] would have been in this role... So I enjoyed Witherspoon and the local color, but I am so very tired of the underlying premise."<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Sweet Home Alabama|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020927/REVIEWS/209270304/1023|work=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=13 December 2012}}</ref>

[[Andrew Sarris]], critic for the ''[[New York Observer]],'' said that the movie "Would be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial New Yorker if 26-year-old Reese Witherspoon were not on hand to inject her pure fantasy character, Melanie Carmichael, with a massive infusion of old-fashioned Hollywood magic."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/s/sweet_home.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212133303/http://www.reelviews.net/movies/s/sweet_home.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 12, 2007|title=Review: Sweet Home Alabama|date=February 12, 2007}}</ref>
