A '''civil union''' (also known as a '''civil partnership''') is a legally recognized arrangement similar to [[marriage]], created primarily as a means to provide recognition in law for same-sex couples. Civil unions grant most or all of the rights of marriage except the title itself. Around the world, developed democracies began establishing civil unions in the late 1990s, often developing them from less formal [[domestic partnership]]s, which grant only some of the rights of marriage. In the majority of countries that established these unions in laws, they have since been either supplemented or replaced by [[same-sex marriage]]. Civil unions are viewed by [[LGBT rights]] campaigners as a "first step" towards establishing same-sex marriage, as civil unions are viewed by supporters of LGBT rights as a "[[separate but equal]]" or "[[second-class citizen|second class]]" status. While civil unions are often established for both opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples, in a number of countries they are available to same-sex couples only.

Beginning with [[Same-sex marriage in Denmark|Denmark]] in 1989, civil unions under one name or another have been established by law in several, mostly [[Developed country|developed]], countries in order to provide legal recognition of relationships formed by unmarried same-sex couples and to afford them rights, benefits, tax breaks, and responsibilities similar or identical to those of legally married couples. In [[Same-sex marriage in Brazil|Brazil]], civil unions were first created for opposite-sex couples in 2002, and then expanded to include same-sex couples through a supreme court ruling in 2011.

Many jurisdictions with civil unions recognize foreign unions if those are essentially equivalent to their own; for example, the [[United Kingdom]] lists equivalent unions in the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004#Schedule 20|Civil Partnership Act 2004 Schedule 20]]. The [[same-sex marriage|marriages of same-sex couples]] performed abroad may be recognized as civil unions in jurisdictions that only have the latter.

==Overview and terminology==

The terms used to designate civil unions are not standardized, and vary widely from country to country.  Government-sanctioned relationships that may be similar or equivalent to civil unions include [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnerships]], [[Registered partnership in the Czech Republic|registered partnerships]], [[domestic partnership]]s, [[Domestic partnership in Tasmania|significant relationships]], [[Reciprocal beneficiary relationships in Hawaii|reciprocal beneficiary relationships]], [[common-law marriage]], [[Adult interdependent relationship in Alberta|adult interdependent relationships]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Germany|life partnerships]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Andorra|stable unions]], [[civil solidarity pact]]s, and so on.  The exact level of rights, benefits, obligations, and responsibilities also varies, depending on the laws of a particular country.  Some jurisdictions allow same-sex couples to adopt, while others forbid them to do so, or allow adoption only in specified circumstances.

As used in the [[United States]], beginning with the state of [[Same-sex marriage in Vermont|Vermont]] in 2000, the term ''civil union'' has connoted a status equivalent to marriage for same-sex couples; ''[[domestic partnership]]'', offered by some states, counties, cities, and employers since as early as 1985,<ref name='buddy062907'>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddybuddy.com/d-p-gov.html |title=Governments Offering Benefits |access-date=2007-07-31 |date=2007-06-29 |publisher=Partners Task Force for Gay & Lesbian Couples }}</ref> has generally connoted a lesser status with fewer benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nclrights.org/site/DocServer/Relationship_Recognition_Update_-_09_03_08.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203035743/http://www.nclrights.org/site/DocServer/Relationship_Recognition_Update_-_09_03_08.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Marriage, Domestic Partnerships, and Civil Unions: An Overview of Relationship Recognition for Same-Sex Couples in the United States|archive-date=December 3, 2008}}</ref>  However, the legislatures of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] states of [[Domestic partnership in California|California]], [[Domestic partnership in Oregon|Oregon]] and [[Domestic partnership in Washington|Washington]] have preferred the term ''domestic partnership'' for enactments similar or equivalent to civil union laws in [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] states.

Civil unions are not seen as a replacement for marriage by many in the LGBT community. "Marriage in the United States is a civil union; but a civil union, as it has come to be called, is not marriage," said [[Evan Wolfson]] of [[Freedom to Marry]].<ref>[[n:Interview with gay marriage movement founder Evan Wolfson|Interview with Evan Wolfson]], David Shankbone, September 30, 2007</ref>  "It is a proposed hypothetical legal mechanism, since it doesn't exist in most places, to give some of the protections but also withhold something precious from gay people. There's no good reason to do that."  However, some opponents of same-sex marriage claim that civil unions rob marriage of its unique status; Randy Thomasson, Executive Director of the Campaign for California Families, calls civil unions "homosexual marriage by another name" and contends that civil unions provide same-sex couples "all the rights of marriage available under state law."<ref name="bushirks">{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/6338458|title=Bush's gay union stance irks conservatives|date=26 October 2004}}</ref>  The California Supreme Court, in the [[In Re Marriage Cases]] decision, noted nine differences<ref name="irmf24"/> in state law.

Civil unions are commonly criticised as being '[[separate but equal]]', critics say they segregate same-sex couples by forcing them to use a separate institution. Supporters of same-sex marriage contend that treating same-sex couples differently from other couples under the law allows for inferior treatment and that if civil unions were the same as marriage there would be no reason for two separate laws. A New Jersey commission which reviewed the state's civil union law reported that the law "invites and encourages unequal treatment of same-sex couples and their children".<ref name="hammond2009">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2009/04/21/2009-04-21_why_civil_unions_arent_enough_in_gay_marriage_debate_separate_but_equal_wont_cut.html|title=Marriage is more perfect union: In gay marriage debate, separate but equal won't cut it|last=Hammond|first=Bill|work=Ny Daily News|date=April 20, 2009|access-date=June 12, 2010|location=New York}}</ref> Some have suggested that creating civil unions which are open to opposite-sex couples would avoid the accusations of apartheid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indegayforum.org/news/show/26950.html |title=The Case for Federal Civil Unions |last=Swayne |first=Steven |work=Independent Gay Forum |date=February 28, 2004 |access-date=June 12, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613050003/http://indegayforum.org/news/show/26950.html |archive-date=June 13, 2010 }}</ref> These have still been criticised as being 'separate but equal' by former [[New Zealand]] MP and feminist [[Marilyn Waring]] as same-sex couples remain excluded from the right to marry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0410/S00234.htm|title=Civil Unions "Anathema" to Marilyn Waring|date=October 23, 2004|work=Scoop|access-date= June 12, 2010}}</ref>

Proponents of civil unions say that they provide practical equality for same-sex couples and solve the problems over areas such as hospital visitation rights and transfer of property caused by lack of legal recognition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID=27532 |title=Obama: Sermon on the Mount supports gay civil unions |work=Baptist Press |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425083108/http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID=27532 |archive-date=2011-04-25 }}</ref> Proponents also say that creating civil unions is a more pragmatic way to ensure that same-sex couples have legal rights as it avoids the more controversial issues surrounding marriage and the claim that the term has a religious source.

Many supporters of same-sex marriage state that the word 'marriage' matters and that the term 'civil union' (and its equivalents) do not convey the emotional meaning or bring the respect that comes with marriage.<ref name="hammond2009"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101040216-588877,00.html|title=Why The M Word Matters To Me|last=Sullivan|first=Andrew|date=February 8, 2004|access-date=June 12, 2010 | work=Time}}</ref> Former US Solicitor General and attorney in the ''[[Perry v.

===Argentina===
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Argentina}}
From 2003 the Argentine province of [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]] and the city of [[Buenos Aires]] allow domestic partnerships. The City of [[Villa Carlos Paz]] (Córdoba) allowed it from 2007. And since 2009 the city of [[Río Cuarto, Córdoba|Río Cuarto]] (Córdoba) allows Civil Unions too.

===Australia===

All levels of Australian Governments under nearly all Australian statutes do recognise same-sex couples as de facto couples as unregistered co-habitation or de facto status since 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/srticllra2008769/ |title=SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS (EQUAL TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH LAWS-GENERAL LAW REFORM) ACT 2008 (NO. 144, 2008) |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |access-date=2014-04-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421160124/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/srticllra2008769/ |archive-date=2015-04-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> From 1 July 2009 Centrelink recognised same-sex couples equally regarding social security – under the common-law marriage, de facto status or unregistered cohabitation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/individuals/same_sex.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-03-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227163241/http://www.centrelink.gov.au/internet/internet.nsf/individuals/same_sex.htm |archive-date=2009-02-27 }}</ref>

===Brazil===
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Brazil}}
{{Same-sex marriage map South America}}
Cohabitation grants 112 benefits as family entities in Brazil since 2002. It is known as {{lang|pt|união estável}} when both parts are legally authorized to marry, and as {{lang|pt|concubinato}} when at least one part is legally prohibited from doing so.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jus2.uol.com.br/doutrina/texto.asp?id=5663 |work=Jus Navegandi |title=Sucessão de companheiros sob a égide da Lei nº 10.406/2002 |access-date=21 August 2019 |first=Antônio Carlos |last=Trevisan |date=September 2004 |language=pt}}</ref> Cohabitation grants all rights marriage confers to the exception of automatic opt-in for one of four systems of property share married couples have access to, and automatic right to inheritance. Potential confusion might arise regarding terminology, given how when Brazilian Portuguese refers to the term {{lang|pt|união civil}}, it tends to be short for {{lang|pt|casamento civil}}, or civil marriage.

Couples that have at least one child registered as descendant of both parts might also access {{lang|pt|união estável}} or {{lang|pt|concubinato}} rights.

Same-sex stable cohabitation in Brazil is legally recognized nationwide since May 5, 2011. Brazil's Supreme Court has voted overwhelmingly in favour of allowing [[same-sex couple]]s the same legal rights as married couples, following pointed recognition of such relationships that dates as far back as 2004. The [[Judgment (law)|decision]] was approved by 10–0 with one abstention. The ruling gave same-sex couples in such relationships the same financial and social rights enjoyed by those in mixed-sex ones.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13304442 |title=Brazil Supreme Court awards gay couples new rights |date=6 May 2011 |publisher=[[www.bbc.co.uk]] |work=[[BBC News Online]] |access-date=21 August 2019 |agency=[[BBC]]}}</ref>

A union between two women and one man was reported in August 2012, though doubts were thrown on its legality.<ref>{{cite news |title=Three-person civil union sparks controversy in Brazil |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19402508 |publisher=[[BBC Online]] |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=28 August 2012 |access-date=21 August 2019 |agency=[[BBC]]}}</ref>

In [[Canada]]:
* [[Domestic partnership in Nova Scotia|Domestic partnerships in Nova Scotia]] (2001),
* [[Civil unions in Quebec]] (2002),
* [[Common-law relationships in Manitoba]] (2002), and
* [[Adult interdependent relationship in Alberta|Adult interdependent relationships in Alberta]] (2003)
were extended to same-sex couples before the enactment (2005) nationwide of [[same-sex marriage in Canada]].

Another notable attempt to extend civil union rights, the [[Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act]] in Ontario, was defeated in 1994.

===Colombia===
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Colombia}}
In 2007, [[Colombia]] came close to passing a law granting legal recognition to same-sex couples, but the bill failed on final passage in one house of the national legislature.
However, a court decision in October 2007 extended social security and health insurance rights to same-sex couples.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-5666.html |title=Colombian court rules in favour of equal rights for gay couples |date=6 October 2007 |access-date=21 August 2019 |newspaper=[[Pink News]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704214811/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-5666.html |archive-date=4 July 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On January 29, 2009, the Constitutional Court ruled that cohabitating same-sex couples must be given all rights offered to unmarried heterosexual couples.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-10938.html |title=Colombian court confirms equal rights for same-sex couples |first=Tony |last=Grew |date=29 January 2009 |access-date=21 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303154858/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-10938.html |archive-date=3 March 2009 |newspaper=[[Pink News]] |url-status=live }}</ref> Making Colombia the first Latin American country to fully grant this right to all its citizens. Couples can claim these rights after living together for two years.
Colombia has since approved same-sex marriage.

===Costa Rica===
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Costa Rica}}
The [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica]] passed a bill in early July 2013 that "confers social rights and benefits of a civil union, free from discrimination", language inserted by lawmaker [[José María Villalta Florez-Estrada]] of the [[Broad Front (Costa Rica)|Broad Front]] party. After the bill passed, several media outlets reported that conservative lawmakers realized the bill's implications for same-sex unions and urged President [[Laura Chinchilla]], who is set to face Villalta in the 2014 presidential election, to use her [[veto]] power to stop the bill from becoming law. Chinchilla, who has suggested the courts should determine the legality of same-sex unions in Costa Rica, refused and signed the bill into law on 4 July. A gay couple has filed an appeal with the [[Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica]] asking that their union be recognized under the new law.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/costa-rica-legalized-gay-civil-unions-19591091|title=Costa Rica May Have Legalized Gay Civil Unions|date=6 July 2013|access-date=6 July 2013|agency=Associated Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711010246/http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/costa-rica-legalized-gay-civil-unions-19591091|archive-date=11 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Gay rights activists reacting to the law said it needs to survive a constitutional challenge in court.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2013/07/05/costa-rica-passes-legislation-permitting-gay-civil-unions-by-accident/|title=Costa Rica Passes Legislation Permitting Gay Civil Unions -- By Accident|date=5 July 2013|access-date=6 July 2013|agency=Fox News Latino}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ticotimes.net/More-news/News-Briefs/Costa-Rican-legislature-accidentally-passes-gay-marriage-legalization_Wednesday-July-03-2013|agency=Tico Times|date=3 July 2013|access-date=6 July 2013|title=Costa Rican legislature accidentally passes gay marriage legalization|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706152250/http://www.ticotimes.net/More-news/News-Briefs/Costa-Rican-legislature-accidentally-passes-gay-marriage-legalization_Wednesday-July-03-2013|archive-date=6 July 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Some constitutional lawyers stated that same-sex couples will "still lack legal capacity" to formalize their unions, despite passage of the bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/costa-rican-lawyers-claim-%E2%80%98accidental%E2%80%99-bill-does-nothing-same-sex-unions060713|title=Costa Rican lawyers claim 'accidental' bill does nothing for same-sex unions|date=6 July 2013}}</ref>

Civil unions were introduced in [[Denmark]] by law on 7 June 1989, the world's first such law, and came into effect on 1 October 1989. On 7 June 2012, the law was replaced by a new same-sex marriage law, which came into effect on 15 June 2012.<ref name=cphpost>[http://cphpost.dk/news/national/gay-marriage-legalised The Copenhagen Post, 7 June 2012: ''Gay marriage legalised''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216001423/http://cphpost.dk/news/national/gay-marriage-legalised |date=16 February 2013 }} Retrieved 2012-09-19</ref>

Registered partnership was by civil ceremony only, but the [[Church of Denmark]] allowed priests to perform blessings of same-sex couples, as it stated that the church blesses people, not institutions. The new law makes same-sex marriages in churches possible, but allows vicars to decline marriages of same-sex couples in their church.<ref name=cphpost/>

On 17 March 2009, the [[Folketing]] introduced a bill that gave same-sex couples in registered partnerships the right to [[LGBT adoption|adopt jointly]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/politics/90-politics/45091-parliamentary-majority-for-same-sex-adoption.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811070655/http://www.cphpost.dk/news/politics/90-politics/45091-parliamentary-majority-for-same-sex-adoption.html|url-status=dead|title=Parliamentary majority for same-sex adoption|archive-date=August 11, 2010}}</ref> This bill was approved on 4 May 2010 and took effect on 1 July 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cphpost.dk/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100508230634/http://www.cphpost.dk/component/content/48896.html?task=view|url-status=dead|title=The Post – The Copenhagen Post – Danish news in english|archive-date=May 8, 2010|website=cphpost.dk}}</ref>

{{Main|Civil solidarity pact}}
The [[France|French]] law providing benefits to same-sex couples also applies to opposite-sex couples who choose this form of partnership over marriage.  Known as the "Pacte civil de solidarité" (PACS), it is more easily dissolved than the divorce process applying to marriage.  Tax benefits accrue immediately (only from 2007 on *Ref), while immigration benefits accrue only after the contract has been in effect for one year. The partners are required to have a common address, making it difficult for foreigners to use this law as a means to a residence permit, and difficult for French citizens to gain the right to live with a foreign partner – especially since the contract does not automatically give immigration rights, as does marriage.<ref>Circulaire n°2007-03 CIV du 5 février 2007</ref>

Between 2000 and 2010, the number of marriages decreased while the number of PACS strongly increased. In 2010, there were 3 PACS for every 4 marriages celebrated in France.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bilan démographique 2010|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1332|publisher=Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|date=January 2011}}</ref>

When Iceland legalised same-sex marriages in 2010 the Act on Registered Partnerships (87/1996) was abolished. Registered partnerships ({{lang-is|staðfest samvist}}) had been the principal legal unions for same-sex partners since the law was passed in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.island.is/fjolskyldan/hjuskapur-sambud/ovigd-sambud |title=Óvígð sambúð |language=is |publisher=Island.is |access-date=2014-04-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407201116/http://www.island.is/fjolskyldan/hjuskapur-sambud/ovigd-sambud |archive-date=2014-04-07 }}</ref>

====Ireland====
In 2010, the lower house of the Irish Parliament [[Dáil Éireann]] passed the [[Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010|bill on Civil Partnerships]] unanimously.

In 2001, the [[Netherlands]] passed a law allowing same-sex couples to marry, in addition to its 1998 "registered partnership" law (civil union) for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples.

====Poland====
In 2004, Senator [[Maria Szyszkowska]] proposed a bill which would legalize same-sex civil unions in Poland. The project was approved by the [[Senate of the Republic of Poland|Senat]] but was never voted upon by the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]], as [[Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz]] (then the Marshal of the Sejm) didn't bring it for the deliberation.

In 2008, when asked about same-sex civil unions, [[First Cabinet of Donald Tusk]] spokeswoman Agnieszka Liszka answered: ''[[Cabinet of Poland|Council of Ministers]] did not and would not take care of that matter.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queer.pl/news/190654/tusk-nie-chce-rozmawiac|title=Tusk nie chce rozmawiać|last=Queermedia.pl}}</ref>

On January 25, 2013 Sejm voted upon three separate bills regarding same-sex civil unions in Poland: by the centre-left [[Democratic Left Alliance]], liberal [[Palikot's Movement]] and centre-right [[Civic Platform]]. Deputies voted: First one 283 against, 137 for, 30 abstained. Second one 276 against, 150 for, 23 abstained. Third one 228 against, 211 for, 10 abstained. All three were rejected, mainly with the votes of centre-right, right-wing and conservative parties: [[Polish People's Party]], [[Law and Justice]] and [[United Poland]]. Majority of deputies from the ruling centre-right [[Civic Platform]] also voted against the first two bills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rp.pl/artykul/16,973895-Sejm-przeciwko-zwiazkom-partnerskim.html?p=1|title=Sejm przeciwko związkom partnerskim - Polityka - rp.pl}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/kronika.nsf/0/07F6202077378DFCC1257B1F00508EA9/%24File/kronika031_7.pdf |title=KRONIKA SEJMOWA |journal=KRONIKA SEJMOWAKANCELARIA |access-date=2014-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/1,75478,12186312,Zwiazki_partnerskie_wracaja_na_polke__Sejm_robi_unik.html|title=Wyborcza.pl}}</ref> The [[Roman Catholicism in Poland|Roman Catholic Church]] in Poland, [[Polish Orthodox Church]] and [[Islam in Poland|Polish Muslims]] opposed all three bills.

In March 2013, Prime Minister Donald Tusk officially stated that a new project of civil unions bill will be presented to the parliament "in two months time", i.e. it was expected in May 2013, but until present (April 2014) no such initiatives took place.

In a 2013 opinion poll conducted by [[Centrum Badania Opinii Społecznej|CBOS]], 68% of Poles were against gays and lesbians publicly showing their way of life, 65% of Poles were against same-sex [[civil unions]], 72% were against same-sex marriage and 88% were against adoption by same-sex couples.<ref name="CBOS Civil union">{{cite web | url=http://cbos.pl/SPISKOM.POL/2013/K_024_13.PDF | title=Stosunek do praw gejów i lesbijek oraz związków partnerskich | publisher=Centrum Badania Opinii Społecznej | date=February 2013 | access-date=30 June 2014 | author=Feliksiak, Michał | language=pl}}</ref>

In December 2014, the Sejm refused to deal with a civil partnership bill proposed by [[Your Movement]], with 235 MPs voting against debating the bill, and 185 MPs voting for.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/sejm-nie-zajal-sie-ustawa-ws-zwiazkow-partnerskich-wiekszosc-poslow-przeciw,499563.html |title=Związki partnerskie do szuflady.

In May 2015, the Sejm again refused to deal with the topic, with 215 MPs voting against and only 146 for. The Prime Minister, [[Ewa Kopacz]], said that civil partnerships are an issue for the next parliament to deal with.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.polityka.pl/tygodnikpolityka/kraj/1620801,1,zwiazki-partnerskie--nie-w-tej-kadencji.read |title=Związki partnerskie - nie w tej kadencji |date=26 May 2015 |access-date=28 May 2015 |publisher=polityka.pl |language=pl}}</ref>

====Switzerland====
{{Main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Switzerland}}

The [[Canton of Geneva]] has a law on cantonal level, the Partenariat cantonal (the Cantonal Domestic Partnership), since 2001. It grants [[cohabitation|unmarried couples]], whether same-sex or opposite-sex, many rights, responsibilities and protections that [[married couples]] have. However, it does not allow benefits in taxation, social security, or health insurance premiums (unlike the federal law). Geneva was the first Canton to recognise same-sex couples through this law. 

On September 22, 2002, voters in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Canton of Zürich|Zurich]] voted to extend a number of marriage rights to same-sex partners, including tax, inheritance, and social security benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6593/is_/ai_n25984534 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227075205/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6593/is_/ai_n25984534 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-12-27 |title=FindArticles.com - CBSi }}</ref> The law is limited to same-sex couples, and both partners must have lived in the canton for six months and formally commit to running a household together and supporting and aiding each another.

On November 12, 2003, the [[Constituent assembly]] of the [[Canton of Fribourg]] granted Registered Partnership as a constitutional right under the Article 14.

On January 27, 2004, the [[Canton of Neuchâtel]] voted a law on cantonal level, the Partenariat enregistré (the Cantonal Registered Partnership). It grants [[cohabitation|unmarried couples]], whether same-sex or opposite-sex, the same rights as married couple for cantonal matters such as responsibilities and protections, benefits in taxation, social security, or health insurance premiums.

On June 5, 2005, voters extended this right to the whole of Switzerland, through a federal referendum. This was the first time that the civil union laws were affirmed in a nationwide referendum in any country. The Federal Domestic Partnership Law, reserved to same-sex couples came into force on January 1, 2007. Although it represents progress for same-sex couples in Switzerland as it grants same rights as marriage - but full joint adoption rights, facilitated naturalization and medically assisted procreation that are explicitly forbidden for same-sex domestic partners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/fr/classified-compilation/20022194/index.html#a28|title=RS 211.231 Loi fédérale du 18 juin 2004 sur le partenariat enregistré entre personnes du même sexe (Loi sur le partenariat, LPart)|website=www.admin.ch}}</ref>

====United Kingdom====
{{Main|Civil partnership in the United Kingdom}}
In 2003, the [[United Kingdom|British]] government announced plans to introduce civil partnerships which would allow same-sex couples the rights and responsibilities resulting from marriage. The [[Civil Partnership Act 2004|Civil Partnership Bill]] was introduced into the [[House of Lords]] on 30 March 2004. After considering amendments made by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], it was passed by the House of Lords, its final legislative hurdle, on 17 November 2004, and received [[Royal Assent]] on 18 November. The Act came into force on 5 December 2005, and same-sex, but not opposite-sex, couples were able to form the civil partnerships from 19 December 2005 in [[Northern Ireland]], 20 December 2005 in [[Scotland]] and 21 December 2005 in [[England]] and [[Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4493094.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - 'Gay weddings' become law in UK}}</ref> Separate provisions were included in the first Finance Act 2005 to allow regulations to be made to amend tax laws to give the same tax advantages and disadvantages to couples in civil partnerships as apply to married couples. At that time, the [[Church of England]], the [[State religion|state church]] in England, permitted clergy to enter into same-sex civil partnerships.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/04/church-of-england-gay-bishops|title=Church of England rules gay men in civil partnerships can become bishops|last=Walker|first=Peter|date=2013-01-04|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-09-16}}</ref>

Aside from the manner in which couples register and the non-use of the word "marriage", civil partnerships grant most of the same legal rights as marriage and generally operate under the same constrictions (one difference being that marriage requires dissolution by divorce while a civil union does not). It is not legal to be in both a civil partnership and a marriage at the same time. Nevertheless, some of those in favour of legal same-sex marriage object that civil partnerships fall short of granting equality.

Both same-sex marriages and civil unions of other nations will be automatically considered civil partnerships under UK law providing they came within Section 20 of the Act. This means, in some cases, non-Britons from nations with civil unions will have greater rights in the UK than in their native countries. For example, a Vermont civil union would have legal standing in the UK, however in cases where one partner was American and the other British, the Vermont civil union would not provide the Briton with right of abode in Vermont (or any other US state or territory), whereas it would provide the American with right of abode in the UK.

In September 2011, the succeeding [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|coalition government]] announced its intention to legalise same-sex marriage in England and Wales by 2015 at the latest.<ref>Sky News: [http://news.sky.com/home/article/16071578 Drive for same-sex marriages] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106040752/http://news.sky.com/home/article/16071578 |date=November 6, 2011 }}. 17 September 2011. Access date: 31 October 2012.</ref> The future status of civil partnerships is unclear. The [[Scottish Government]], which has devolved responsibility for such legislation, held a consultation - concerning both civil and religious same sex marriage - in the autumn of 2011. Legislation to allow same-sex marriage in England and Wales was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in July 2013 and came into force on 13 March 2014, and the first same-sex marriages took place on 29 March 2014. The first same-sex marriages in Scotland took place in December 2014.

In June 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that restricting civil partnerships to same-sex couples was discriminatory.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/27/uk-ban-on-heterosexual-civil-partnerships-ruled-discriminatory|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Ban on heterosexual civil partnerships in UK ruled discriminatory |first=Owen|last=Boycott|date=27 June 2018|access-date=4 January 2019}}</ref> In response, the Prime Minister announced in October 2018 that civil partnerships would be opened to heterosexual couples.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/02/civil-partnerships-to-be-opened-to-heterosexual-couples|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Civil partnerships to be opened to heterosexual couples|last1=Boycott|first1=Owen|last2=Carrell|first2=Severin|date=2 October 2018|access-date=4 January 2019}}</ref>

===New Zealand===
{{Main|Civil union in New Zealand}}
On 9 December 2004 the [[New Zealand]] [[Parliament of New Zealand|Parliament]] passed the Civil Union Bill, establishing civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples. The debate over Civil Unions was highly divisive in New Zealand, inspiring great public emotion both for and against the passing. A companion bill, the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill was passed shortly thereafter to remove discriminatory provisions on the basis of relationship status from a range of statutes and regulations. As a result of these bills, all couples in New Zealand, whether married, in a civil union, or in a de facto partnership, now generally enjoy the same rights and undertake the same obligations. These rights extend to immigration, next-of-kin status, social welfare, matrimonial property and other areas.

The [[Civil Union Act 2004]] came into effect on 26 April 2005 with the first unions able to occur from Friday 29 April 2005.

===South Africa===
{{Main|Civil partnership in South Africa}}
In [[South Africa]], a "civil union" is either a marriage or a civil partnership, although confusingly the term "civil union" is commonly used when "civil partnership" is meant. Same-sex and opposite-sex couples may register their unions either as [[Same-sex marriage in South Africa|marriages]] or as civil partnerships. In laws where "marriage" is mentioned, its definition now retroactively includes civil partnerships.

===United States===
{{Main|Same-sex unions in the United States|Domestic partnership in the United States}}

The first civil unions in the United States were offered by the state of [[Same-sex marriage in Vermont|Vermont]] in 2000. The [[United States government|federal government]] does not recognize these unions. By the end of 2006, [[Same-sex marriage in Connecticut|Connecticut]] and New Jersey had also enacted civil union laws; [[Same-sex marriage in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] followed in 2007. Furthermore, California's domestic partnership law had been expanded to the point that it became practically a civil union law, as well. The same might be said for domestic partnership in the District of Columbia, domestic partnership in Washington, and domestic partnership in Oregon.

Jurisdictions in the U.S. that offer civil unions or domestic partnerships granting nearly all of the state-recognized rights of marriage to same-sex couples include:
* [[Domestic partnership in California]] (2000 – expanded over time)
* [[Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia|Domestic partnership in the District of Columbia]] (1992 law implemented, 2002 became effective – expanded over time)
* [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Hawaii|Civil union in Hawaii]] (2012)
* [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Illinois|Civil union in Illinois]] (2011)
* [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Nevada|Domestic partnership in Nevada]] (2009)
* [[Recognition of same-sex unions in New Jersey|Civil union in New Jersey]] (2007)
* [[Domestic partnership in Oregon]] (2008)
* [[Same-sex marriage in Rhode Island|Civil union in Rhode Island]] (2011)
* [[Domestic partnership in Washington State]] (2007 – expanded over time)

States in the U.S. with domestic partnerships or similar status granting some of the rights of marriage include:
* [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Colorado|Designated beneficiary agreement in Colorado]] (2009)
* [[Reciprocal beneficiary relationships in Hawaii|Reciprocal beneficiary relationship in Hawaii]] (1997)
* [[Domestic partnership in Maine]] (2004)

Since October 2014, all states that provide for civil unions, domestic partnerships, or similar arrangements between same-sex partners also allow same-sex partners to legally wed.

====California====
{{Main|Domestic partnership in California}}
In California, where domestic partnership (DP) has been available to same-sex and certain opposite-sex couples since 2000, a wholesale revision of the law in 2005 made it substantially equivalent to marriage at the state level.  In 2007, the Legislature took a further step when it required same-sex DP couples to file state income taxes jointly.  (Couples must continue to file federal taxes as individuals.)  In the May 2008 ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'' decision, the state supreme court noted nine [[Domestic partnership in California#Differences from marriage|differences between Domestic Partnerships and same-sex marriage]] in state law, including a cohabitation requirement for domestic partners, access to CalPERS long-term care insurance (but not CalPERS in general), and the lack of an equivalent to California's "confidential marriage" institution.<ref name="irmf24">[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/s147999.pdf In Re Marriage Cases], California Supreme Court Decision, footnote 24, pages 42–44.</ref> The cohabitation requirement was dropped on January 1, 2012, and a "confidential option" for domestic partners became available the same day.

====Colorado====
A bill to establish civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples passed both chambers of the Colorado legislature and was signed into law by Governor [[John Hickenlooper]]. Civil unions began on May 1, 2013.

====Connecticut====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Connecticut}}
In 2005, the [[Connecticut General Assembly]] passed a bill to adopt civil unions in Connecticut.  Connecticut's civil unions were identical to marriage and provided all of the same rights and responsibilities except for the title. Connecticut was the first state in the U.S. to voluntarily pass a same-sex civil unions law through the legislature without any immediate court intervention.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/01/AR2005100100962.html|title=Connecticut's First Same-Sex Unions Proceed Civilly|first=David A.|last=Fahrenthold|date=2 October 2005|via=washingtonpost.com}}</ref> The law was repealed on October 1, 2010, and replaced with a law making marriage gender-neutral.

====Delaware====
Delaware Governor [[Jack Markell]] signed a civil union bill on May 12, 2011, that establishes civil unions in the state effective January 1, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Beth|title=Governor signs Delaware civil unions bill|newspaper=[[The News Journal]]|date=May 12, 2011|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-05-12-delaware-civil-unions_n.htm|access-date=May 12, 2011}}</ref> The law was repealed on July 1, 2014, and replaced with a law making marriage gender-neutral.

====District of Columbia====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia}}
Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia was legalized on December 18, 2009.  Marriage licenses became available on March 3, 2010, and marriages began on March 9, 2010. [[Same-sex marriage in the District of Columbia|Domestic Partnerships in the District of Columbia]] (1992 law implemented, 2002 law came into effect – expanded over time to 2009)

====Hawaii====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Hawaii}}
Hawaii legalized civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples on January 1, 2012. Same-sex marriage became legal on December 2, 2013.

====Illinois====
On December 1, 2010, the Illinois state senate passed, in a 32-24-1 vote, SB1716 the "Illinois Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act" just one day after the Illinois House of Representatives did the same in a 61-52-2 vote. On January 31, 2011, Illinois state Governor Pat Quinn signed SB1716 into law, establishing civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples. The new law came into effect on June 1, 2011.  The provision allowing opposite-sex couples to establish a civil union effectively doubles as a tool for widowed seniors to keep [[Social Security (United States)#Widow(er)'s benefits|survivor's benefits]] from a marriage while gaining marital rights at the state level with another partner.<ref>{{cite news|last=Avila |first=Oscar |author2=Huppke, Rex |title=Civil unions aren't just for same-sex couples |newspaper=[[The Chicago Tribune]] |date=Dec 2, 2010 |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-heterosexuals-civil-unions-12020101202,0,571376.story |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205023356/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-heterosexuals-civil-unions-12020101202%2C0%2C571376.story |archive-date=December 5, 2010 |access-date=July 17, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Maine====

Maine legalized domestic partnership for same-sex and opposite-sex couples in 2004. Maine's domestic partnership registry only provides limited rights, most of which are geared toward protecting couples' security in emergency situations.

====New Hampshire====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in New Hampshire}}
On April 26, 2007, the [[New Hampshire General Court]] (state legislature) passed a civil union bill, and Governor [[John H.

====New Jersey====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in New Jersey}}
On October 25, 2006, the [[Supreme Court of New Jersey]] gave [[New Jersey Legislature|New Jersey lawmakers]] 180 days to rewrite the state's marriage laws, either including same-sex couples or creating a new system of [[civil unions]] for them. On December 14 the Legislature passed a bill establishing [[Same-sex marriage in New Jersey|civil unions in New Jersey]], which was signed into law by [[Governor of New Jersey|Governor]] [[Jon Corzine]] on December 21, 2006.  The first civil unions took place on February 19, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc7ny.com/|title=ABC7 Eyewitness News - WABC-TV New York}}</ref>

There are differences between civil unions and domestic partnerships.  In 2004, the state of [[New Jersey]] enacted a domestic partnership law, offering certain limited rights and benefits to same-sex and different-sex couples.  In 2006, however, after a [[Supreme Court of New Jersey|state Supreme Court]] [[Lewis v. Harris|ruling]] that same-sex couples must be extended all the rights and benefits of marriage, the Legislature passed a civil unions law, effective in 2007, which is an attempt to satisfy the court's ruling.

====Nevada====
On May 31, 2009, the Nevada legislature overrode Governor [[Jim Gibbons (U.S. politician)|Jim Gibbons]]' veto of a domestic partnership bill. The bill allows registered domestic partners, whether they are a same-sex or opposite-sex couple, to have most of the state level rights and responsibilities afforded to married couples. It does not require any other entity to provide rights or benefits afforded to married individuals. This has left the partnership bill ineffective compared to those of other states. The law took effect 1 October 2009.

====Oregon====
{{main|Domestic partnership in Oregon}}
Since 4 February 2008, Oregon offers domestic partnerships which grant nearly all of the state-recognized rights of marriage to same-sex couples.

====Rhode Island====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Rhode Island}}
Civil unions were permitted in Rhode Island since July 1, 2011 until July 1, 2013.

====Vermont====
{{Main|Same-sex marriage in Vermont}}
The controversial civil unions law<ref name=vtculaw>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.state.vt.us/otherprg/civilunions/civilunionlaw.html|title=Professional Regulation - Home - Vermont Secretary of State|access-date=2006-12-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923144929/http://www.sec.state.vt.us/otherprg/civilunions/civilunionlaw.html|archive-date=2009-09-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> that was passed in the [[Vermont General Assembly]] in 2000 was a response to the [[Vermont Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Baker v. Vermont]]'', requiring that the state grant same-sex couples the same rights and privileges accorded to married couples under the law.

A Vermont civil union is nearly identical to a legal marriage, as far as the rights and responsibilities for which state law, not federal law, is responsible are concerned.<ref name=vtculaw /> It grants partners [[next-of-kin]] rights and other protections that heterosexual married couples also receive.  However, despite the [[Full Faith and Credit clause|"full faith and credit" clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], civil unions are generally not recognized outside Vermont in the absence of specific legislation.  Opponents of the law have supported the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] and the proposed [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] in order to prevent obligatory recognition of same-sex couples in other jurisdictions.  This means that many of the advantages of marriage, which fall in the federal jurisdiction (over 1,100 federal laws, such as joint federal income tax returns, visas and work permits for the foreign partner of a U.S. citizen, etc.), are not extended to the partners of a Vermont civil union.

As far as voluntary recognition of the civil union in other jurisdictions is concerned, [[New York City]]'s Domestic Partnership Law, passed in 2002, recognizes civil unions formalized in other jurisdictions. [[Germany]]'s international civil law (EGBGB) also accords to Vermont civil unions the same benefits and responsibilities that apply in Vermont, as long as they do not exceed the standard accorded by German law to a German civil union. The law was replaced by the same-sex marriage law on September 1, 2009.

====Washington====
{{Main|Domestic partnership in Washington}}
Washington offers domestic partnerships which grant nearly all of the state-recognized rights of marriage to same-sex couples. Washington is the first state to have passed a same-sex civil union bill by a popular vote.

Washington legalized same-sex marriage early in 2012, which provided that a couple in a civil union would have two years to convert their civil union to a marriage. The law was upheld by popular [[Washington Referendum 74 (2012)|referendum]] in November 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/06/anti-gay-marriage-measure-qualifies-for-wash-state-ballot/1 |title=Anti-gay-marriage measure qualifies for Wash. state ballot |work=USA Today |date=June 12, 2012 |access-date=August 16, 2012}}</ref>
