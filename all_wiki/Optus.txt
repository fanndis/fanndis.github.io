'''Singtel Optus Pty Limited''' (commonly referred to as '''Optus''') is an [[Australian]] [[telecommunications]] company headquartered in [[Macquarie Park]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. It is a [[wholly owned subsidiary]] of [[Singtel]]. Optus is the second largest [[wireless telecommunications provider]] in [[Australia]] behind [[Telstra]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Optus doubles NBN customers as mobile subs hit 10 million|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/optus-doubles-nbn-customers-as-mobile-subs-hit-10-million/ |website=CBS Interactive |accessdate=23 June 2020}}</ref>

The company trades under the Optus brand, while maintaining several wholly owned subsidiary, such as [[Uecomm]] in the network services market and [[Alphawest]] in the ICT services sector. To provide services, Optus mostly owns and operates its own network infrastructure, It provides services both directly to end users and also acts as a wholesaler to other service providers such as [[Exetel]] and [[Amaysim]]. Through its Optus 'Yes' brand, it provides [[broadband]], and wireless internet services. Other wholesale services include Satellite and 4G Mobile.

The company was originally known as '''Optus Communications Pty Limited'''. It went through the names '''Cable & Wireless Optus Pty Limited''', '''Cable & Wireless Optus Limited''' and '''SingTel Optus Limited''' before changing to its present name.

Optus is divided into four major business [https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/archive/rrc/inquiries/telecommunications/rt_submissions/sub_33_optus_attachment.pdf areas] - Mobile; Business; Wholesale; and Consumer & Multimedia.

==History==
===AUSSAT and deregulation===
Optus can trace its beginnings back to the formation of the Government-owned AUSSAT Pty Limited in 1981. In 1982, Aussat selected the Hughes 376 for their initial satellites, with the first, AUSSAT A1, launched in August 1985.<ref>{{cite web | title = Aussat A-Series | work = Australia's Satellites & Programs | publisher = Lowdown | url = http://www.lowdown.com.au/sat_assat.html | accessdate = 2007-06-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608034807/http://www.lowdown.com.au/sat_assat.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-08}}</ref> AUSSAT satellites were used for both military and civilian satellite communications, and delivering [[television]] services to remote [[outback]] communities.
{{see also|Optus fleet of satellites}}

With Aussat operating at a loss and with moves to deregulate [[Communications in Australia#Deregulation|telecommunications in Australia]], the government decided to sell Aussat, coupled with a telecommunications licence. The licence was sold to Optus Communications – a consortium including:<ref>{{cite book|title=Report 333 - The sale of Aussat|date=September 1994|publisher=The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia – Joint Committee of Public Accounts|isbn=0-644-35468-2|pages=12}}</ref>

The new telecommunications company was designed to provide competition to then government owned telecommunications company ''Telecom Australia'', now known as [[Telstra]].

===Early history===
[[File:Optus communications logo.png|thumb|Original 1990s logo|120px|right]]
Optus gained the second general carrier licence in January 1991.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/technology/optus-rings-up-20-years-sticking-to-its-guns/news-story/d357df679f5db28b7a09184e0f27ee9f Mitchell Bingemann, (30 January 2012), Optus rings up 20 years, sticking to its guns, ''The Australian''] Retrieved 9 February 2017</ref>[[File:Optus building Adelaide Australia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Former Optus building in [[Adelaide, South Australia]]]]

After privatisation, AUSSAT became Optus and its first offering to the general public was to offer long-distance calls at cheaper rates than that of its competitor Telstra. The long-distance calling rates on offer were initially available by consumers dialing ''1'' before the area code and phone number. Following this, a ballot process was conducted by then regulator [[AUSTEL]], with customers choosing their default long-distance carrier.<ref>{{cite news | last = Zucker | first = Paul | title = Australia's Telecom apologizes for misleading ads | publisher = Newsbytes News Network | date = 1993-06-04 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NEW/is_1993_June_4/ai_14017101 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081014084416/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NEW/is_1993_June_4/ai_14017101 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2008-10-14 | accessdate = 2007-06-05 }}</ref> Customers who made no choice or refused to respond to the mailout campaign automatically remained as a Telstra long-distance customer. Customers who remained with Telstra could dial the override code of ''1456'' before the area code and phone number to manually select Optus as the carrier for that single call. Since 1 July 1998, consumers have the choice of preselecting their preferred long-distance carrier or dialling the override code before dialling a telephone number.

The group began by building an interstate [[fibre optic]] cable and a series of exchanges between Optus' interstate network and Telstra's local network. It also laid fibre optics into major office buildings and industrial areas, and focused on high bandwidth local, (interstate) long distance, and interstate calls for business. In its early years, Optus was only able to offer local and long-distance calls to residential customers through Telstra's local phone network. Telstra would carry residential to residential calls to Optus' exchanges, and then the calls would be switched to Optus' long-distance fibre optic network.

Optus was the main sponsor of the [[1997 ARL season]].

== Corporate affairs ==

=== Chief Executive Officer ===
[https://www.optus.com.au/about/corporate/our-executive-profiles KELLY BAYER ROSMARIN]

Kelly Bayer Rosmarin commenced as CEO of Optus and Consumer Australia on 1 April 2020.

A respected senior executive, Kelly joined Optus as Deputy CEO on 1 March 2019 following a variety of executive roles including Group Executive, Institutional Banking and Markets at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

===The hybrid fibre-coax rollout===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
These practices meant that Optus was the largest customer of Telstra. To become competitive Optus would need to lay its own local phone network. To provide a [[killer application]] for this, the Australian Federal government sold subscription television licences. Optus, as well as the [[Seven Network]], businessman [[Kerry Stokes]] and American cable company Cablevision, formed the [[Optus Television|Optus Vision]] consortium. [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] and Telstra created the rival [[Foxtel]] consortium.

Telstra's local phone network did not have the capability to deliver Foxtel pay television to consumers in the early 1990s, so Telstra identified a need to create a broadband network to support this new product.

As [[Telstra]] and Optus could not agree on terms for a joint broadband cable roll out, they laid two competing cable networks, in addition to Telstra's existing copper network, at a combined cost estimated of over A$6bn.

Whilst Telstra focused on creating a broadband network specifically for broadcast, Optus designed their cable network to provide telephony services in addition to broadcast television.

Optus is no longer a customer of Telstra's after deciding to move the funding used to lease [[Telstra]]'s copper network into constructing their [[Hybrid fibre-coaxial|hybrid fiber-coaxial]] network, the first in Australia.

Other wholly owned subsidiaries of note no longer have a significant active role as individual entities. These are as follows:

[[Reef Networks]] was formed in 1999 to provide an [[Optical fiber|optical fibre]] link between [[Brisbane]] and [[Cairns]] in [[Queensland]]. Optus gained exclusive access to this link in 2001, ahead of acquiring the organisation in 2005.<ref>{{cite news | title = Optus buys Reef | publisher = ZDNet Australia | date = 2005-03-31 | url = http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/communications/soa/Optus-buys-Reef/0,130061791,139186609,00.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-04 }}</ref>

[[XYZed]] was established by Optus in 2000 to provide wholesale business-grade [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] services under an individual brand, but today provides a collection of products only as part of the Optus Wholesale & Satellite division. XYZed established a network of [[Digital subscriber line access multiplexer|DSLAMs]] inside [[Telstra]] telephone exchanges, utilising [[Local loop unbundling|Unconditioned Local Loop]] services to reach end users.<ref>{{cite press release | title = Cable & Wireless Optus and Lucent to Build National DSL Network | publisher = Cable & Wireless Optus and Lucent Technologies | date = 2000-06-14 | url = http://www.xyzed.com.au/admin/uploads/pdf/00.06.14.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151018135007/http://www.xyzed.com.au/admin/uploads/pdf/00.06.14.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2015-10-18| accessdate = 2006-06-05 }}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
Optus' fully owned network infrastructure consists of the following:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.optus.com.au/portal/site/wholesale/menuitem.58d2265ecf5c99a54f7416058c8ac7a0/?vgnextoid=ea3058ebbebd1010VgnVCM100000c8a87c0aRCRD |title=Optus Network |accessdate=2007-06-04 |publisher=Optus}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.optus.com.au/portal/site/wholesale/menuitem.58d2265ecf5c99a54f7416058c8ac7a0/?vgnextoid=8c6058ebbebd1010VgnVCM100000c8a87c0aRCRD |title=DSL Network and Coverage |accessdate=2007-06-04 |publisher=Optus}}</ref>

===Network backbone===

* ExtraTerrestrial [[Optical fiber|Fibre Optic]] Network
** Cairns to Brisbane
** Brisbane to Sydney ([[Self-healing ring|fully diverse]] over two physically separate paths)
** Sydney to Melbourne ([[Self-healing ring|fully diverse]] over two physically separate paths, one via [[Canberra]], one via the coast)
** Melbourne to [[Adelaide]]
** Adelaide to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]
* [[Microwave radio relay|SDH Digital Microwave]]
** [[Hobart]] to [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]]
* [[Communications satellite|Satellite]]
** Fleet of [[geostationary]] satellites (See [[Optus fleet of satellites]])
** International Earth Stations in Sydney and Perth
** National Earth Stations in Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]
* Regional [[Telephone exchange|exchanges]] in Sydney (Rosebery), Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra, Adelaide and Perth.
* Telehousing Data Centres in Melbourne and Sydney

===Customer access network===
{{see also|Access network}}
* [[Hybrid fibre-coaxial]] (HFC) network in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, providing consumer [[Telephony|fixed telephony]], [[cable internet]] and [[cable television]] services.
* CBD optical fibre rings in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra and [[Wollongong]], providing direct access for corporate and government services.
* [[Digital subscriber line access multiplexer|DSLAMs]] in certain [[Telstra]] local telephone exchanges in all states. Originally only providing business-grade [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] services, newer installations also provide consumer [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] and [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] telephony.

OptusNet is one of only five ISPs in Australia to provide [[Hybrid fibre-coaxial|Cable]] internet (the other four are [[BigPond]], [[Neighbourhood Cable]], [[TransACT]] and [[e-wire]]). In August 2010, OptusNet released an upgrade of its HFC network to the [[DOCSIS]] 3.0 standard,<ref>[http://www.optus.com.au/aboutoptus/About+Optus/Media+Centre/Media+Releases/2010/Optus+upgrades+cable+broadband+to+deliver+supersonic+speeds+in+Brisbane%2C+Melbourne+and+Sydney Optus.com.au]</ref> which enabled customers to access a maximum theoretical downstream bandwidth of 100 [[Megabits]]. OptusNet is also one of the few ISPs in Australia to currently provide [[Asymmetric digital subscriber line|ADSL2+]] via its own [[Digital subscriber line access multiplexer|DSLAMs]], which it also resells to other ISPs.<ref>{{cite web | title = Australia&nbsp;— Broadband&nbsp;— ADSL2+ Providers | publisher = BuddeComm | url = http://www.budde.com.au/Reports/Contents/Australia-Broadband-ADSL2-Providers-4159.html | accessdate = 2007-06-16 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070919200127/http://www.budde.com.au/Reports/Contents/Australia-Broadband-ADSL2-Providers-4159.html | archivedate = 19 September 2007}}</ref>

The Optus network operates on the following bandwidth frequencies across Australia:
* [[3G]] [[UMTS]] 900/2100&nbsp;MHz
* [[4G]] [[Long Term Evolution|LTE]] 700 / 1800 / 2100 / 2300 / 2600&nbsp;MHz network which has been in progressive rollout since 2012.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/09/optus-announces-lte-plans-for-2012/ | title=Optus Plans LTE For April Next Year | publisher=Gizmodo | date=15 September 2011 | accessdate=16 November 2011 | author=Alex Kidman}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.itnews.com.au/News/272077,optus-forges-ahead-with-lte.aspx| title=Optus forges ahead with LTE | publisher=ITnews | date=15 September 2011 | accessdate=16 November 2011}}</ref> [[VoLTE]] is currently being rolled out across Australia. For now, [[Voice over LTE|VoLTE]] is only available in CBD and metro areas in [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth and Canberra on selected devices purchased on postpaid contracts. Until VoLTE has been fully rolled out, voice calling is still reliant on the 3G network (and the 2G network until it is terminated).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/optus-joins-voice-over-lte-race/ |title=Optus joins Voice over LTE race |last1=Taylor |first1=Josh |date=25 November 2013 |website=ZDNet |publisher=CBS Interactive |access-date=4 April 2015}}</ref>
* [[5G]] 3500&nbsp;MHz rollout started in October 2019

The [[2G]] [[GSM]] 900/1800&nbsp;MHz network was terminated on 3 April 2017 in [[Western Australia]] and [[Northern Territory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://media.optus.com.au/media-releases/2015/optus-to-cease-2g-services-from-april-2017/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302010302/https://media.optus.com.au/media-releases/2015/optus-to-cease-2g-services-from-april-2017/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 March 2016|title=Optus to cease 2G services from April 2017|date=5 August 2015}}</ref> [[2G|2G GSM]] will be completely terminated on 1 August 2017 when 2G is disconnected in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[Queensland]], [[Tasmania]] and [[South Australia]]. A device that is capable of running 3G at 900&nbsp;MHz will be required once 2G is completely disconnected to remain connected across Australia.
