[[File:Tayswift fifteen standing cropped.jpg|thumb|250px|Swift performing "Tim McGraw" during the Fearless Tour in 2009]]
Prior to the launch of the tour, Swift played several shows in the US, including two sold-out performances at the [[San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo]] and the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]] in early 2009. Swift also played several dates in the United Kingdom and Australia, including two shows at the [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shineon-media.com/2009/05/07/taylor-swift-plays-shepherds-bush-empire/|title=Taylor Swift plays Shepherd's Bush Empire/|date=May 7, 2009|publisher=Shine On Media|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}</ref>

Also, in the midst of her own tour, Swift began opening shows in select cities for [[Keith Urban]] on his Escape Together World Tour 2009; opening for concerts in Cincinnati, Auburn Hills, Ft. Wayne, Atlanta, Des Moines, Moline, Boston, Philadelphia, and Kansas City. 

==Background and development==
The tour was announced on January 29, 2009, via her official website.<ref name="Taylor Swift Press Releases">{{cite web|url=http://taylorswift.com/fearlesstour_pressrelease.html |title=Taylor Swift, Billboard's Best-selling Artist of 2008 announces "FEARLESS 2009" Headlining Tour |date=January 30, 2009 |publisher=Taylor Swift Press Releases |accessdate=June 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307230747/http://taylorswift.com/fearlesstour_pressrelease.html |archivedate=March 7, 2009 }}</ref> The initial press release announced that Swift would visit 54 cities in 39 states and provinces in the United States and Canada. Joining her on the tour would be a new country music group, [[Gloriana (band)|Gloriana]], as well as former ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant, [[Kellie Pickler]].

The tour kicked off in [[Evansville, Indiana]] on April 23, 2009 at [[Roberts Municipal Stadium]]. In honor of the kickoff of the sold-out tour, Swift was presented the key to the city of Evansville and the City Council President declared Thursday, April 23, 2009 Taylor Swift Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1609987/taylor-swift-presented-key-to-the-city-of-evansville-ind.jhtml|title=Taylor Swift Presented Key to the City of Evansville, Ind.|date=April 24, 2009|publisher=CMT|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}</ref>

The tour featured a theatrical presentation of graphics, sets and visual elements all designed by Swift. The show runs nearly 90 minutes and showcases Swift playing five different guitars as well as the piano. The show featured multiple costume changes and a fairy-tale castle illuminated by more than a million lumens of light.<ref name="Taylor Swift Press Releases"/>

In late June, a new tour date was announced for November 23 at the [[Wembley Arena]] in London. However it became apparent that neither Kellie Pickler nor Gloriana would be joining her on the UK part of the tour. Taylor Swift announced another date in the UK at the [[Manchester Evening News Arena]] on November 24.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.men-arena.com/about/?page_id=1623|title=Taylor Swift adds second and last UK tour date.|date=August 20, 2009|publisher=Manchester Evening News Arena|accessdate=August 20, 2009}}</ref> This was the final and second tour date in the UK. It was announced later that singer [[Justin Bieber]] would join Swift on the two UK dates.<ref name="JustinBieber">{{cite news|url=http://oceanup.com/2009/09/25/justin-bieber-joins-taylor-swift-uk-tour|title=Justin Bieber Joins Taylor Swift UK TOUR}}</ref> While performing at Wembley Arena, Bieber broke his foot while he performed the opening lines of "One Time", but still finished the song. Despite his injury, Bieber confirmed that he would still perform in Manchester with Swift the following day, although the Wembley concert was cut short as he could not perform the encore. Bieber then went on to perform at the Manchester performance with an encore, he sang "With You" a cover of the original version from Chris Brown. Following a 10-minute applause after she had sung "Tim McGraw", Swift told the Manchester audience "Everytime I hear the word Manchester, I won't be able to stop smiling...I love you!".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2577245/justin-bieber-injury/|title=Justin Bieber Breaks Foot At London Concert|first=|last=Archive-Kyle-Anderson|website=MTV News}}</ref> According to a German magazine, Swift was supposed to play three shows in Germany. However, tickets for those concerts never went on sale.

On September 30, it was announced that Swift would return to Australia in February 2010 to play another series of concerts, but now in arenas.<ref name="thehothits">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehothits.com/news/17333/taylor-swift-announces-2010-australian-tour!|website=thehothits.com|title=www.thehothits.com/news/17333/taylor-swift-announces-2010-australian-tour!|accessdate=September 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002232736/http://www.thehothits.com/news/17333/taylor-swift-announces-2010-australian-tour!|archive-date=October 2, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> On October 8, it was announced that the tour would be extended through June 2, 2010 to include 37 additional shows in North America.<ref name="taylorswift">{{cite web|url=http://www.taylorswift.com/tourpage.html|website=taylorswift.com|title=tourpage|accessdate=September 28, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319055251/http://taylorswift.com/tourpage.html|archivedate=March 19, 2009}}</ref> It has been confirmed that Justin Bieber will be performing at the Gillette Stadium on June 5, 2010 with Swift.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gillettestadium.com/event_calendar/index.cfm?ac=detail&eid=3648|title=Gillette Stadium – Gillette Stadium|first=Adept|last=Mobile|website=www.gillettestadium.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204151654/http://www.gillettestadium.com/event_calendar/index.cfm?ac=detail&eid=3648|archivedate=December 4, 2009}}</ref>

==Concert synopsis==
The show opens with the stage decorated as a school hallway. Swift appears at the top of the stage, in a band uniform, and sings "[[You Belong With Me]]". During the climax of the song, dancers remove Swift's outfit to reveal a sparkling, silver dress. "[[Our Song (Taylor Swift song)|Our Song]]" and "Tell Me Why" are performed next, and then Swift gives a speech about her high school crush and his girlfriend. The backdrops of the stage turn into a library where Swift performs "[[Teardrops on My Guitar]]". She then sings "[[Fearless (Taylor Swift song)|Fearless]]" and exits for a costume change.

The next segment begins with Swift, in a red dress, and a male dancer on red armchairs where she sings "[[Forever & Always (Taylor Swift song)|Forever & Always]]". Swift leaves and changes into a teal gown and crosses the audience during a performance of "Hey Stephen". She goes to a B-stage where "[[Fifteen (song)|Fifteen]]" and "[[Tim McGraw (song)|Tim McGraw]]" are sung with a guitar. The act ends with Swift returning to the main stage, singing "[[White Horse (Taylor Swift song)|White Horse]]".

The third act begins with Swift and her dancers in Renaissance attire during a performance of "[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]", she then changes into a white gown and sings "The Way I Loved You". The next segment sees Swift, in a purple mini-dress, at a piano, which is at the top of the stage. There she performs "[[You're Not Sorry]]", with elements of [[Justin Timberlake]]'s "[[What Goes Around...Comes Around]]", as her dancers, in black, perform acrobats on the bottom stage. "[[Picture to Burn]]" and "[[Change (Taylor Swift song)|Change]]" are sung next, the former with fire on the backdrops, and Swift exits for a final costume change.

During the encore, she appears on top of the stage again, in a black gown, performing "I'm Only Me When I'm With You" with her supporting acts [[Gloriana]] and [[Kellie Pickler]]; however, during shows in 2010, Swift sang "[[Today Was a Fairytale]]" alone. She then gives a speech about an ex who cheated on her and sings "[[Should've Said No]]". During the performance, fake rain comes from the roof of the stage and Swift closes the show by going backstage as curtains are drawn.
