'''Indian Americans''' or '''Indo-Americans''' are [[Americans]] with ancestry from [[India]]. The [[U.S. Census Bureau|United States Census Bureau]] uses the term '''Asian Indian''' to avoid confusion with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. With a population of almost 4 million, Indian Americans make up 1.2% of the U.S. population and are the third largest group of Asian Americans after [[Chinese Americans]] and [[Filipino Americans]].

==Terminology==
In the [[Americas]], the term "Indian" has historically been used for [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] since [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] in the 15th century. Qualifying terms such as "[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]" and "[[India|East Indian]]" were and still are commonly used in order to avoid ambiguity. The U.S. government has since coined the term "Native American" in reference to the indigenous peoples of the United States, but terms such as "American Indian" [[Native American name controversy|remain]] among indigenous as well as non-indigenous populations. Coincidentally, many Indian Americans are also of Native American descent. Since the 1980s, Indian Americans have been categorized as "Asian Indian" (within the broader subgroup of [[Asian American]]) by the [[United States Census Bureau]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koshy|first=Susan|title=Category Crisis: South Asian Americans and Questions of Race and Ethnicity|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/444259|journal=Diaspora: A Journal of Transnational Studies|year=1998|volume=7|issue=3|pages=285–320|doi=10.1353/dsp.1998.0013|s2cid=143516386|issn=1911-1568}}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|Asian immigration to the United States}}

===Pre 1800===
Beginning in the 17th century, members of the [[East India Company]] would bring Indian servants to the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]].<ref name="Thakur">{{cite book|last1=Thakur|first1=Pradeep|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVdwDwAAQBAJ|title=Indian Americans (Part 1)|date=2009|isbn=978-81-908705-5-9|pages=15–17}}</ref> The [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] made Asians ineligible for citizenship.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schultz|first=Jeffrey D.|title=Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics: African Americans and Asian Americans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDV40aK1T-sC&q=African+Americans+discriminated+by+Naturalization+Act+of+1790&pg=PA284|page=284|year=2002|isbn=9781573561488|accessdate=2015-09-29}}</ref>

===19th century===
[[File:The Sikh Temple in Stockton, California, 1915.jpg|thumb|The first gurudwara was established in 1912 by the early immigrant Sikh farmers in Stockton, California.]]
The first significant wave of Indian immigrants entered the United States in the 19th century.  By 1900, there were more than two thousand Indian [[Sikhs]] living in the United States, primarily in [[California]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard T. Schaefer|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMUola6pDnkC&pg=PT801|date=20 March 2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-2694-2|page=801|chapter=Indian Americans}}</ref> (At least one scholar has set the level lower, finding a total of 716 Indian immigrants to the U.S. between 1820 and 1900.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |last1=Rangaswamy |first1=Padma |title=Namasté America : Indian immigrants in an American metropolis |year=2000 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |isbn=0-271-01981-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/namasteamericain00rang }}</ref>) Emigration from India was driven by difficulties facing Indian farmers, including the challenges posed by the colonial land tenure system for small landowners, and by drought and food shortages, which worsened in the 1890s.  At the same time, Canadian steamship companies, acting on behalf of Pacific coast employers, recruited Sikh farmers with economic opportunities in [[British Columbia]]. Racist attacks in British Columbia, however, prompted Sikhs and new Sikh immigrants to move down the Pacific Coast to [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]], where they worked in [[lumber mill]]s and in the railroad industry.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Many [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] Sikhs who settled in California, around the [[Yuba City]] area, formed close ties with Mexican Americans.<ref name="Thakur" /> The presence of Indian Americans also helped develop interest in Eastern religions in the US and would result in its influence on American philosophies such as [[Transcendentalism]]. [[Swami Vivekananda]] arriving in Chicago at the World's Fair led to the establishment of the [[Vedanta Society]].

===20th century===
Between 1907 and 1908, Sikhs moved further south to warmer climates in California, where they were employed by various railroad companies. Some white Americans, resentful of economic competition and the arrival of people from different cultures, responded to Sikh immigration with racism and violent attacks.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The [[Bellingham riots]] in Bellingham, Washington on September 5, 1907 epitomized the low tolerance in the U.S. for Indians and Sikhs, who were called "[[hindoos]]" by locals. While anti-Asian racism was embedded in U.S. politics and culture in the early 20th century, Indians were also racialized for their anticolonialism, with U.S. officials pushing for Western imperial expansion abroad casting them as a "Hindu" menace. Although labeled Hindu, the majority of Indians were Sikh.<ref name="Seema">{{cite book|author=Seema Sohi|title=Echoes of Mutiny: Race, Surveillance, and Indian Anticolonialism in North America|year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-937625-4|page=8 |quote=Indians in North America, nearly 90 percent of whom where Sikhs from the state of Punjab, were also racialized through colonial gendered discourses. During the early decades of the twentieth century, US Immigration, Justice, and State Department officials cast Indian anti-colonialists as a "Hindoo" menace}}</ref> In the early 20th century, a range of state and federal laws restricted Indian immigration and the rights of Indian immigrants in the U.S.  In the 1910s, American nativist organizations campaigned to end immigration from India, culminating in the passage of the [[Barred Zone Act]] in 1917. In 1913, the Alien Land Act of California prevented Sikhs (in addition to Japanese and Chinese immigrants) from owning land. However, Asian immigrants got around the system by having Anglo friends or their own U.S. born children legally own the land that they worked on.  In some states, [[anti-miscegenation]] laws made it illegal for Indian men to marry white women. However, it was legal for "brown" races to mix. Many Indian men, especially Punjabi men, married Hispanic women and Punjabi-Mexican marriages became a norm in the West.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="Oxford University Press">{{cite book |last1=CHAKRAVORTY |first1=SANJOY |title=The other one percent : Indians in America |year=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780190648749}}</ref>

[[Bhicaji Balsara]] became the first known Indian to gain naturalized U.S. citizenship. As a [[Parsi]], he was considered a "pure member of the Persian sect" and therefore a "free white person". The judge  [[Emile Henry Lacombe]], of the [[Southern District of New York]], only gave Balsara citizenship on the hope that the [[United States attorney]] would indeed challenge his decision and appeal it to create "an authoritative interpretation" of the law. The U.S. attorney adhered to Lacombe's wishes and took the matter to the Circuit Court of Appeals in 1910. The Circuit Court of Appeal agreed that [[Parsis]] are classified as white.<ref name="auto">{{cite book|title=Postmodernism & a Sociology...(c)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnMon2RiFLAC&pg=PA143|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|isbn=978-1-61075-322-7|pages=143–}}</ref>

[[A. K. Mozumdar]] was also considered "Caucasian" and therefore eligible for citizenship. Between 1913 and 1923, about 100 Indians were naturalized.

In 1923, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]'' that Indians were ineligible for citizenship because they were not "free white persons".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The Court argued that the "great body of our people" would reject Indians.<ref name="Thind">Zhao, X. & Park, E.J.W. (2013). Asian Americans: An Encyclopedia of Social, Cultural, Economic, and Political History</u>. Greenwood. pp. 1142. {{ISBN|978-1-59884-239-5}}</ref> Over fifty Indians had their citizenship revoked after this decision, but [[Sakharam Ganesh Pandit]] fought against denaturalization. He was a lawyer and married to a white American, and he regained his citizenship in 1927. However, no other naturalization was permitted after the ruling, which led to about 3,000 Indians leaving the United States. Many other Indians had no means of returning to India. One such immigrant, Vaisho Das Bagai, committed suicide in despair: "The return migration was large enough to render questionable the idea of immigration as a one-way system."<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

After the [[Immigration Act of 1917]], Indian immigration into the U.S. decreased. Illegal entry through the Mexican border became the way of entering the country for Punjabi immigrants. California's Imperial Valley had a large population of Punjabis who assisted these immigrants and provided support. Immigrants were able to blend in with this relatively homogenous population. The [[Ghadar Movement|Ghadar Party]], a group in California that [[Indian independence movement|campaigned for Indian independence]], facilitated illegal crossing of the Mexican border, using funds from this migration "as a means to bolster the party's finances".<ref name="Oxford University Press"/> The Ghadar Party charged different prices for entering the US depending on whether Punjabi immigrants were willing to shave off their beard and cut their hair. It is estimated that between 1920 and 1935, about 1,800 to 2,000 Indian immigrants entered the U.S. illegally.<ref name="Oxford University Press"/>

Indians started moving up the social ladder by getting higher education. In 1910, [[Dhan Gopal Mukerji]] came to UC Berkeley when he was 20 years old. He was an author of many children's books and won the Newbery Medal in 1928 for his book ''Gay-Neck: The Story of a Pigeon''. However, he committed suicide at the age of 46 while he was suffering from depression. Another student, [[Yellapragada Subbarow]], came to the U.S. in 1922. He became a biochemist at [[Harvard University]], and he "discovered the function of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an energy source in cells, and developed methotrexate for the treatment of cancer." However, being a foreigner, he was refused tenure at Harvard. [[Gobind Behari Lal]], who came to UC Berkeley in 1912, became the science editor of the ''San Francisco Examiner'' and was the first Indian American to win the Pulitzer Prize for journalism.<ref name="Oxford University Press"/>

After WWII, U.S. policy re-opened the door to Indian immigration, although slowly at first. The [[Luce–Celler Act of 1946]] Luce–Celler Act of 1946 permitted a quota of 100 Indians per year to immigrate to the U.S. It also allowed Indian immigrants to naturalize and become citizens of the U.S., effectively reversing the Supreme Court's 1923 ruling in ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/rootsinthesand/a_lucecellar.html |title=Roots in the Sand&nbsp;— the Archives |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref> The Naturalization Act of 1952, also known as the [[McCarran-Walter Act]], repealed the Barred Zone Act of 1917, but limited immigration from the former Barred Zone to a total of 2,000 per year. In 1910, 95% of all Indian Americans lived on the western coast of the United States. In 1920, that proportion decreased to 75%; by 1940, it was 65%, as more Indian Americans moved to the east coast. In that year, Indian Americans were registered residents in 43 states. The majority of Indian Americans on the west coast were in rural areas, but on the east coast they became residents of urban areas. In the 1940s, the prices of the land increased, and the Bracero program brought thousands of Mexican guest workers to work on farms, which helped shift second-generation Indian American farmers into "commercial, nonagricultural occupations, from running small shops and grocery stores, to operating taxi services and becoming engineers." In Stockton and Sacramento, a new group of Indian immigrants from the state of Gujarat opened several small hotels.<ref name="Oxford University Press"/> In 1955, 14 of 21 hotels enterprises in San Francisco were operated by Gujarati Hindus. By the 1980s, Gujaratis had come to "dominate the industry." An article published by ''National Geographic'' mentions several stories of Gujarati immigrants in the hospitality industry.<ref>{{cite web |last1=BHATTACHARJEE |first1=YUDHIJIT |title=How Indian Americans Came to Run Half of All U.S. Motels |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2018/09/south-asia-america-motels-immigration/ |website=Culture & History |accessdate=9 March 2019 |date=4 September 2018}}</ref> The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional Northern European groups, which would significantly alter the demographic mix in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |title= 1965 immigration law changed face of America |author=Jennifer Ludden |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5391395 |publisher=NPR|accessdate=December 9, 2016}}</ref> Not all Indian Americans came directly from India; some came to the U.S. via [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian communities in other countries]], including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], ([[South Africa]], the former British colonies of [[East Africa]],<ref name="auto1">{{cite book|last1=Rangaswamy|first1=Padma|title=Indian Americans|date=2007|publisher=Chelsea House|location=New York|isbn=9780791087862|page=[https://archive.org/details/indianamericans0000rang/page/55 55]|edition=2007 Hardcover|url=https://archive.org/details/indianamericans0000rang|url-access=registration|quote=gujarati.}}</ref> (namely [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]]), and [[Uganda]], [[Mauritius]]), the [[Asia-Pacific]] region ([[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[Fiji]]),<ref name="auto1"/> and the [[Caribbean]] ([[Guyana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Suriname]], and [[Jamaica]]).<ref name="auto1"/> From 1965 until the mid-1990s, long-term immigration from India averaged about 40,000 people per year.  From 1995 onward, the flow of Indian immigration increased significantly, reaching a high of about 90,000 immigrants in the year 2000.<ref name="Oxford University Press"/>

===21st century===
The beginning of the 21st century marked a huge significance in the migration trend from [[India]] to the [[United States]]. The implementation of Privatization and liberalization had changed the entire outflow of migrants. The [[Business process outsourcing to India|emergence of Information Technology industry in Indian cities]] as Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad had led to the large number of migrations to the USA primarily from the erstwhile states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh chennai Tamilnadu and Karnataka in South India. There are sizable population of people from the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Telangana]], [[Gujarat]], [[Punjab]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Kerala]] who have settled in different parts of the United States. Indians comprise over 80% of all [[H-1B visa]]s. Indian Americans have risen to become the richest ethnicity in America, with an average household income of $126,891 (compared to the US average of $65,316).

In the last twenty years, a large number of students have started migrating to the United States to pursue higher education. A variety of estimates state that over 500,000 Indian American students attend higher-education institutions in any given year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theprint.in/india/governance/no-let-up-in-number-of-Indians-going-to-study-in-the-us/148859/|title=India holds on to its position as one of the top two countries that send students to US|last=Sharma|first=Kritika|date=2018-11-13|website=ThePrint|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theprint.in/india/education/21-fewer-indian-students-went-abroad-last-year-as-us-figures-see-biggest-drop/326433/|title=21% fewer Indian students went abroad last year as US figures saw biggest drop|last=Sharma|first=Kritika|date=2019-11-26|website=ThePrint|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref> As per Institute of International Education (IIE) 'Opendoors' report, 202,014 new students from India enrolled in US education institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://opendoorsdata.org/fast_facts/fast-facts-2019/|title=IIE Open Doors / Fast Facts 2019|website=IIE Open Doors / Fast Facts 2019}}</ref>

===Education===
According to Pew Research in 2015, of Indian Americans aged 25 and older, 72% had obtained a bachelor's degree and 40% had obtained a postgraduate degree, whereas of all Americans, 19% had obtained a bachelor's degree and 11% had obtained a postgraduate degree.<ref name="Pew">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/fact-sheet/asian-americans-indians-in-the-u-s/|title=Indians in the U.S. Fact Sheet|date=September 8, 2017|website=POewsocialtrends.org|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}</ref>

=== Household income ===
The [https://www.census.gov median household income for Indian immigrants] in 2019 was much higher than that of the overall foreign- and native-born populations. Indians overall have much higher incomes than the total foreign and native-born populations. In 2019, households headed by an Indian immigrant had a median income of $132,000, compared to $64,000 and $66,000 for all immigrant and U.S.-born households, respectively. By far they are the richest and most successful ethnic group in the USA due to many factors including relatively low wages for highly skilled workers in India which creates an incentive for highly skilled Indians to seek better-paid career opportunities overseas.

In 2019, Indian immigrants were less likely to be in poverty (5 percent) than immigrants overall (14 percent) or the U.S. born (12 percent).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/indian-immigrants-united-states-2019#Income_poverty|title=Indian Immigrants in the United States|date=2020-10-16|work=migrationpolicy.org|access-date=2020-11-04}}</ref>

{{see|Sikhism in the United States}}
There are nearly 30 million Sikhs around the world today, and a vast majority of them live in the Indian state of Punjab.  There is also a robust and flourishing diaspora, with communities large and small all over the globe. Much of the diaspora is concentrated in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] due to migration within the [[British Empire]], yet Sikhs continue to establish themselves in various countries throughout the world.

From the time of their arrival in the late 1800s, Sikh men and women have been making notable contributions to American society.
In 2007, there were estimated to be between 250,000 and 500,000 Sikhs living in the United States, with largest populations living on the East and West Coasts, together with additional populations in Detroit, Chicago, and Austin. The United States also has a number of non-Punjabi converts to Sikhism.
Sikh men are typically identifiable by their unshorn beards and turbans (head coverings), articles of their faith. Many organisations like World Sikh Organisation (WSO), Sikh Riders of America, SikhNet, Sikh Coalition, SALDEF, United Sikhs, National Sikh Campaign continue to educate people about Sikhism. There are many "Gurudwaras" Sikh temples present in all states of USA.

According to the [[Race (United States Census)|official U.S. racial categories]] employed by the [[United States Census Bureau]], [[Office of Management and Budget]] and other U.S. government agencies, American citizens or [[resident alien]]s who marked "''Asian Indian''" as their ancestry or wrote in a term that was automatically classified as an Asian Indian became classified as part of the Asian race at the 2000 US Census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_RHI125212.htm |title=State and County QuickFacts |accessdate=May 10, 2014 |publisher=US Census Bureau |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327095622/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_RHI125212.htm |archive-date=March 27, 2014 }}</ref> As with other modern official U.S. government racial categories, the term "Asian"<!--the US Census does not use the term "Asian American". It uses the term "Asian".--> is in itself a broad and [[heterogeneous]] classification, encompassing all peoples with origins in the original peoples of the [[Far East]], [[Southeast Asia]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]].

In previous decades, Indian Americans were also variously classified as [[White American]], the "Hindu race", and "other".<ref>Assisi, Frank. Desparades. 2006.

===Immigration===
Indians are among the largest ethnic groups legally immigrating to the United States. The immigration of Indians has taken place in several waves since the first Indian came to the United States in the 1700s. A major wave of immigration to California from the region of Punjab took place in the first decade of the 20th&nbsp;century. Another significant wave followed in the 1950s which mainly included students and professionals. The elimination of immigration quotas in 1965 spurred successively larger waves of immigrants in the late 1970s and early 1980s. With the technology boom of the 1990s, the largest influx of Indians arrived between 1995 and 2000. This latter group has also caused surge in the application for various immigration benefits including applications for green card. This has resulted in long waiting periods for people born in India from receiving these benefits.

As of 2012, over 330,000 Indians were on the visa wait list, third only to [[Mexican people|Mexico]] and [[Filipino people|The Philippines]].<ref name="wait times pdf 2012">{{cite web|url=http://www.travel.state.gov/pdf/WaitingListItem.pdf |title=Annual Report of Immigration Visa Applicants in the Family-sponsored and Employment-based preferences Registered at the National Visa Center as of November 1, 2012 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=1 November 2012 |work=Bureau of Consular Affairs |publisher=United States Secretary of State |accessdate=5 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217034041/http://www.travel.state.gov/pdf/WaitingListItem.pdf |archive-date=February 17, 2013 }}</ref>

In December, 2015, over 30 Indian students seeking admission in two US universities—[[Silicon Valley University]] and the [[Northwestern Polytechnic University]]—were denied entry by [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs and Border Protection]] and were deported to India. Conflicting reports suggested that the students were deported because of the controversies surrounding the above-mentioned two universities. However, another report suggested that the students were deported as they had provided conflicting information at the time of their arrival in US to what was mentioned in their visa application. "According to the US Government, the deported persons had presented information to the border patrol agent which was inconsistent with their visa status," read an advisory published by [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)]] which was published in the Hindustan Times.<ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com">{{cite web|title = 'Honour your own visas,' says India as US clarifies on deportation of Indians&nbsp;— Times of India|url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Honour-your-own-visas-says-India-as-US-clarifies-on-deportation-of-Indians/articleshow/50384593.cms|website = The Times of India|accessdate = 2016-01-04}}</ref>

=== Income disparities ===
Although Indian Americans have the highest average and median household income of any demographic group in America, there exist significant and severe income disparities among various communities of Indian Americans. In [[Long Island]], the average family income of Indian Americans was roughly $273,000, while in [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], the average family income of Indian Americans was only $24,000, an eleven-fold difference.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Singh|first=Sanjoy Chakravorty, Devesh Kapur, and Nirvikar|title=America's "little Indias" are high-tech hubs, working-class neighborhoods, and everything in between|url=https://qz.com/india/889483/from-25000-to-250000-americas-little-indias-are-high-tech-hubs-working-class-neighborhoods-and-everything-in-between/|access-date=2020-11-26|website=Quartz India|language=en}}</ref>
