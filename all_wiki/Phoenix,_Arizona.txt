After the departure of the Hohokam, groups of [[Akimel O'odham]] (commonly known as Pima), [[Tohono O'odham]], and [[Maricopa people|Maricopa]] tribes began to use the area, as well as segments of the [[Yavapai people|Yavapai]] and Apache.{{sfn|Montero|2008|pp=10–11}} The O'odham were offshoots of the [[Sobaipuri]] tribe, who in turn were thought to be the descendants of the Hohokam.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Delicate Diplomacy on a Restless Frontier: Seventeenth-Century Sobaipuri Social And Economic Relations in Northwestern New Spain, Part I | last=Seymour | first=Deni J. | issue=2007b | journal=New Mexico Historical Review | page=82}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srpmic-nsn.gov/history_culture/maricopa.asp |title=Xalychidom Piipaash (Maricopa) People |publisher=Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community |access-date=February 17, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805082906/http://www.srpmic-nsn.gov/history_culture/maricopa.asp |archive-date=August 5, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/maricopa-tribe.htm |title=The Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico |publisher=Bureau of American Ethnology, Government Printing Office |year=1906 |access-date=March 24, 2016 |editor=Hodge, Frederick Webb |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140218050828/http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/maricopa-tribe.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 18, 2014 }}</ref>

The Akimel O'odham were the major group in the area.

They grew crops such as sweet corn, tapery beans, squash, lentils, sugar cane, and melons, as well as taking advantage of native plants such as saguaro fruits, cholla buds, mesquite tree beans, and mesquite candy (sap from the mesquite tree). They also hunted local game such as deer, rabbit, and javelina for meat.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sanxaviermission.org/Tohono.html | title=San Xavier del Bac Mission-Tohono O'odham | publisher=San Xavier Mission | access-date=February 24, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tonation-nsn.gov/ton_history.aspx | title=Tohono O'odham History | access-date=February 24, 2014}}</ref>

The [[Mexican–American War]] ended in 1848, Mexico ceded its northern zone to the United States, and the region's residents became U.S. citizens.

[[File:Phoenix-Duppa-Montgomery Adobe-1895-2.JPG|right|thumb|The Phillip Darrell Duppa adobe house was built in 1870 and is the oldest house in Phoenix. The homestead is named after "Lord" Darrell Duppa, an Englishman who is credited with naming Phoenix and Tempe as well as founding the town of New River.]]

The history of the city of Phoenix begins with [[Jack Swilling]], a Confederate veteran of the Civil War who prospected in the nearby mining town of [[Wickenburg]] in the newly formed [[Arizona Territory]]. He was traveling through the [[Salt River Valley]] in 1867 and saw a potential for farming to supply Wickenburg with food. He also noted the eroded mounds of dirt that indicated previous canals dug by native peoples who had long since left the area. He formed the Swilling Irrigation and Canal Company that year, dug a large canal that drew in river water, and erected several crop fields in a location that is now within the eastern portion of central Phoenix near its airport. Soon, other settlers began to arrive, appreciating the area's fertile soil and lack of frost, and the farmhouse that Swilling constructed became a frequently-visited location in the valley.<ref>https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/survey/default.aspx?dm_id=107721&sid=xzdik1aw.jli#surveyDetailsTabIndex=1</ref><ref>https://wateruseitwisely.com/arizona-water-pioneers-jack-swilling/</ref> [[Phillip Darrell Duppa|Lord Darrell Duppa]] was one of the original settlers in Swilling's party, and he suggested the name "Phoenix", as it described a city born from the ruins of a former civilization.<ref name=Phxgov />

The Board of Supervisors in Yavapai County officially recognized the new town on May 4, 1868, and the first post office was established the following month with Swilling as the postmaster.<ref name=Phxgov /> In October 1870, a meeting of valley residents was held to select a new townsite for the valley's growing population. A new location three miles to the west of the original settlement, containing several allotments of farmland, was chosen, and lots began to officially be sold under the name of Phoenix in December of that year. This established the downtown core in a grid layout pattern that has been the hallmark of Phoenix's urban development ever since.

On February 12, 1871, the territorial legislature created Maricopa County by dividing Yavapai County; it was the sixth one formed in the Arizona Territory. The first election for county office was held in 1871 when Tom Barnum was elected the first sheriff. He ran unopposed when the other two candidates (John A. Chenowth and Jim Favorite) fought a duel; Chenowth killed Favorite and was forced to withdraw from the race.<ref name=Phxgov />

The town grew during the 1870s, and President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] issued a land patent for the site of Phoenix on April 10, 1874. By 1875, the town had a telegraph office, 16 saloons, and four dance halls, but the townsite-commissioner form of government needed an overhaul. An election was held in 1875, and three village trustees and other officials were elected.<ref name=Phxgov /> By 1880, the town's population stood at 2,453.<ref name=Moffat>{{cite book |last=Moffatt |first=Riley |title=Population History of Western U.S. Cities & Towns, 1850–1990 |publisher=Scarecrow |place=Lanham, MD |year=1996 |page=14}}</ref>

[[File:Phoenix1885-AerialMap HiRes.jpg|alt=Refer to caption|thumb|right|Aerial lithograph of Phoenix from 1885]]
By 1881, Phoenix's continued growth made the board of trustees obsolete. The Territorial Legislature passed the Phoenix Charter Bill, incorporating Phoenix and providing a mayor-council government; Governor [[John C. Fremont]] signed the bill on February 25, 1881, officially incorporating Phoenix as a city with a population of around 2,500.<ref name=Phxgov />

The railroad's arrival in the valley in the 1880s was the first of several events that made Phoenix a trade center whose products reached eastern and western markets. In response, the [[Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce|Phoenix Chamber of Commerce]] was organized on November 4, 1888.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixchamber.com/about/history |title=History |publisher=Greater Phoenix Chamber of Commerce |access-date=October 9, 2015}}</ref> The city offices moved into the new City Hall at Washington and Central in 1888.<ref name=Phxgov /> The territorial capital was moved from Prescott to Phoenix in 1889, and the territorial offices were also in City Hall.<ref>{{cite book | title=Early Phoenix | editor=Kathleen Garcia | page=18| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F25aMroD_IUC&pg=PA18| publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2008 | isbn=978-0738548395 }}</ref> With the arrival of the [[Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix Railroad]] in 1895, Phoenix was connected to Prescott, Flagstaff, and other communities in the northern part of the territory. The increased access to commerce expedited the city's economic rise. The [[Phoenix Union High School]] was established in 1895 with an enrollment of 90.<ref name=Phxgov />

On March 4, 1930, former U.S. President [[Calvin Coolidge]] dedicated a dam on the Gila River named in his honor.

During World War II, Phoenix's economy shifted to that of a distribution center, transforming into an "embryonic industrial city" with the mass production of military supplies.<ref name=Phxgov/> There were three air force fields in the area: [[Luke Air Force Base|Luke Field]], [[Williams Air Force Base|Williams Field]], and [[Falcon Field (Arizona)|Falcon Field]], as well as two large pilot training camps, [[Thunderbird Field No. 1]] in Glendale and [[Scottsdale Airport|Thunderbird Field No. 2]] in Scottsdale.<ref name=Phxgov /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/airport/history.asp |title=Scottsdale Airport History |publisher=scottsdaleaz.gov |access-date=February 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Manning |first=Thomas A. |year=2005 |title=History of Air Education and Training Command, 1942–2002 |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofaireduc00gop |publisher=Office of History and Research, Headquarters, AETC |place=Randolph AFB, Texas |isbn=978-1-178-48983-5}}</ref>

===Post-World War II explosive growth===
A town that had just over 65,000 residents in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, with a population of nearly 1.5&nbsp;million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned, bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area.<ref name=Phxgov /> In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when [[Motorola]] chose Phoenix as the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as [[Intel]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]] also moved into the valley and opened manufacturing operations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/history/2015/05/14/125-republic-anniversary-arizona-internment-camps-high-tech-firms/27188081/ |newspaper=Arizona Republic |date=May 14, 2015 |title=1940s in Arizona: Internment camps and high-tech firms |access-date=March 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6gDKWZAIL?url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/history/2015/05/14/125-republic-anniversary-arizona-internment-camps-high-tech-firms/27188081/ |archive-date=March 23, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Urbanization and Sustainability | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGa-DCN5ODoC&pg=PA164 | editor1=Christopher G Boone |editor2=Michail Fragkias | publisher=Springer Science & Business Media | year=2012 | pages=64–65 | isbn=9789400756663 }}</ref>

By 1950, over 105,000 people resided in the city and thousands more in surrounding communities.<ref name=Phxgov /> The 1950s growth was spurred on by advances in air conditioning, which allowed both homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat experienced in Phoenix and the surrounding areas during its long summers. There was more new construction in Phoenix in 1959 alone than from 1914 to 1946.<ref name=AZed>{{cite web |url=http://www.arizonaedventures.com/reference-guide/arizona-history-timeline/20th-century/ |title=20th Century |publisher=Arizona Edventures |access-date=February 5, 2014}}</ref>

Like many emerging American cities at the time, Phoenix's spectacular growth did not occur evenly. It largely took place on the city's north side, a region that was nearly all Caucasian. In 1962, one local activist testified at a [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|US Commission on Civil Rights]] hearing that of 31,000 homes that had recently sprung up in this neighborhood, not a single one had been sold to an African-American.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Power Lines: Phoenix and the Making of the Modern Southwest|last = Needham|first = Andrew|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2014|location = Princeton, NJ|pages = 84}}</ref> Phoenix's African-American and Mexican-American communities remained largely sequestered on the south side of town.

In the 1970s the downtown area experienced a resurgence, with a level of construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate boom of the 2000s.

==Geography==
[[File:Phoenix by Sentinel-2, 2020-09-09.jpg|alt=A photo taken from space of the Phoenix Area|left|thumb|Sentinel-2 satellite image of the Phoenix metro area in 2020]]
Phoenix is in the southwestern United States, in the south-central portion of Arizona; about halfway between [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] to the southeast and [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] to the north. By car, the city is approximately {{convert|150|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} north of the US-Mexico border at [[Sonoyta]] and {{convert|180|mi|abbr=on}} north of the border at [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]]. The metropolitan area is known as the "Valley of the Sun" due to its location in the Salt River Valley.<ref name=Valley101 /> It lies at a mean elevation of 1,086 feet (331&nbsp;m), in the northern reaches of the [[Sonoran Desert]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=136:3:0::NO:3:P3_FID,P3_TITLE:44784,Phoenix |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |title=Feature Detail Report for: Phoenix |access-date=March 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6g8o6H2WH?url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=136:3:0::NO:3:P3_FID,P3_TITLE:44784,Phoenix |archive-date=March 20, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Other than the mountains in and around the city, Phoenix's topography is generally flat, which allows the city's main streets to run on a precise grid with wide, open-spaced roadways. Scattered, low mountain ranges surround the valley: [[McDowell Mountains]] to the northeast, the [[White Tank Mountains]] to the west, the [[Superstition Mountains]] far to the east, and both [[South Mountains (Arizona)|South Mountain]] and the [[Sierra Estrella]] to the south/southwest. [[Camelback Mountain]], North Mountain, [[Sunnyslope Mountain]], and [[Piestewa Peak]] are within the heart of the valley. The city's outskirts have large fields of irrigated cropland and Native American reservation lands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.summitpost.org/phoenix-mountains-and-neighboring-ranges/285171 |title=Phoenix Mountain Overview |publisher=summitpost.org |access-date=March 5, 2014}}</ref> The Salt River runs westward through Phoenix, but the riverbed is often dry or contains little water due to large irrigation diversions. South Mountain separates the community of [[Ahwatukee]] from the rest of the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 517.9 square miles (1,341&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). 516.7 square miles (1,338&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of it is land, and 1.2 square miles (3.1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, or 0.2%) of it is water.

[[Maricopa County, Arizona#Demographics|Maricopa County]] grew by 811% from 186,000 in 1940 to 1,509,000 by 1980, thanks in part to air conditioning, cheap housing, and an influx of retirees. The once "modest urban sprawl" now "grew by 'epic' proportions— not only a myriad of residential tract developments on both farmland and desert." Retail outlets and office complexes spread out and did not concentrate in the small downtown area. There was low population density and a lack of widespread and significant high-rise development.<ref>James W. Elmore, ''A Guide to the architecture of Metro Phoenix ''(1985) p. 20</ref> As a consequence Phoenix became a textbook case of [[urban sprawl]] for geographers.<ref>Paul M.

Like most of Arizona, Phoenix does not observe [[daylight saving time]]. In 1973, Governor [[Jack Williams (American politician)|Jack Williams]] argued to the U.S. Congress that energy use would increase in the evening should Arizona observe DST. He went on to say energy use would also rise early in the day "because there would be more lights on in the early morning." Additionally, he said daylight saving time would cause children to go to school in the dark.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/printDS/75798 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111247/http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/printDS/75798 |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |title=Arizona does not need daylight saving time&nbsp;– Arizona Daily Star.' |date=May 19, 2005 |access-date=June 19, 2012}}</ref>

Since 1979, the city of Phoenix has been divided into [[urban village]]s, many of which are based upon historically significant neighborhoods and communities that have since been annexed into Phoenix.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoenix.gov/pdd/pz/village-planning-committees |publisher=City of Phoenix |title=Village Planning Committees |access-date=March 20, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325080714/https://www.phoenix.gov/pdd/pz/village-planning-committees |archive-date=March 25, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Each village has a planning committee appointed directly by the city council. According to the city-issued village planning handbook, the purpose of the village planning committees is to "work with the city's planning commission to ensure a balance of housing and employment in each village, concentrate development at identified village cores, and to promote the unique character and identity of the villages."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoenix.gov/pddsite/Documents/pdd_pz_pdf_00020.pdf |publisher=City of Phoenix |title=The Village Planning Handbook |page=1 |access-date=March 20, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327021820/https://www.phoenix.gov/pddsite/Documents/pdd_pz_pdf_00020.pdf |archive-date=March 27, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> There are 15 urban villages: [[Ahwatukee, Phoenix|Ahwatukee Foothills]], [[Alhambra, Phoenix|Alhambra]], [[Camelback East, Phoenix|Camelback East]], [[Central City, Phoenix|Central City]], [[Deer Valley, Phoenix|Deer Valley]], Desert View, [[Encanto, Phoenix|Encanto]], [[Estrella, Phoenix|Estrella]], [[Laveen, Arizona|Laveen]], [[Maryvale, Phoenix|Maryvale]], North Gateway, North Mountain, Paradise Valley, [[Rio Vista, Phoenix|Rio Vista]], and South Mountain.

The urban village of Paradise Valley is distinct from the nearby [[Paradise Valley, Arizona|Town of Paradise Valley]]. Although the urban village is part of Phoenix, the town is independent.

In addition to the above urban villages, Phoenix has a variety of commonly referred-to regions and districts, such as [[Downtown Phoenix|Downtown]], [[Midtown, Phoenix, Arizona|Midtown]], Uptown,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoenix.gov/pddsite/Documents/ReinventPHX%20Uptown%20District%20Profile.pdf |publisher=City of Phoenix |title=ReinventPHX District Profile: Uptown |access-date=October 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102180553/https://www.phoenix.gov/pddsite/Documents/ReinventPHX%20Uptown%20District%20Profile.pdf |archive-date=January 2, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> West Phoenix, [[North/Northwest Phoenix|North Phoenix]], [[South Phoenix]], [[Biltmore Area]], [[Arcadia, Phoenix, Arizona|Arcadia]], and [[Sunnyslope, Phoenix|Sunnyslope]].

The heaviest snowstorm on record took place on January 21–22, 1937, when {{convert|1|to|4|in|cm}} fell in parts of the city and did not melt entirely for three days. On December 6, 1998, snow fell across the northwest portions of the city, and Sky Harbor reported a dusting of snow.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/psr/general/history/index.php?page=snow |title=A history of snow fall in Phoenix |publisher=NOAA |access-date=December 5, 2011}}</ref> On December 30, 2010, and February 20, 2013, [[graupel]] fell across much of the city, although it was widely believed to be snow.<ref>{{cite web|last=Haldiman |first=Philip |url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/2010/12/30/20101230phoenix-area-residents-report-snow-falling-valley.html |title=Phoenix-area residents report snow falling across Valley |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=December 30, 2010 |access-date=February 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120720052218/http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/2010/12/30/20101230phoenix-area-residents-report-snow-falling-valley.html |archive-date=July 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Most recently, on February 21–22, 2019, the far northern and northeastern sections of the metro area were blanketed with several inches of snow while Sky Harbor received record rainfall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ktar.com/story/2449524/snow-lands-really-sticks-in-phoenix-during-record-rainy-day/ |title=Snow lands, really sticks in far Phoenix area during record rainy day |publisher=ktar.com |date=February 22, 2019 |access-date=February 25, 2019}}</ref>

===Flora and fauna===
While some of the native flora and fauna of the [[Sonoran Desert]] can be found within Phoenix city limits, most are found in the suburbs and the undeveloped desert areas that surround the city. Native mammal species include [[coyote]], [[Collared Peccary|javelina]], [[bobcat]], [[Cougar|mountain lion]], [[Sylvilagus audubonii|desert cottontail rabbit]], [[jackrabbit]], [[antelope ground squirrel]], [[mule deer]], [[ring-tailed cat|ringtail]], [[coati]], and multiple species of bats, such as the [[Mexican free-tailed bat]] and [[western pipistrelle]], that roost in and around the city. There are many species of native birds, including [[Costa's hummingbird]], [[Anna's hummingbird]], [[Gambel's quail]], [[Gila woodpecker]], [[mourning dove]], [[white-winged dove]], the [[roadrunner]], the [[cactus wren]], and many species of raptors, including [[falcons]], [[hawks]], [[owls]], [[vultures]] (such as the [[turkey vulture]] and [[black vulture]]), and [[eagles]], including the [[golden eagle|golden]] and the [[bald eagle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/trails/things-to-do/wildlife |title=The Wildlife of the Phoenix Mountain Preserves |publisher=phoenix.gov |access-date=September 5, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919085511/https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/trails/things-to-do/wildlife |archive-date=September 19, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azgfd.gov/w_c/urban_az_wildlife.shtml |title=Living With Wildlife&nbsp;– Arizona Wildlife |publisher=Arizona Game and Fish Department |access-date=February 10, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222011519/http://www.azgfd.gov/w_c/urban_az_wildlife.shtml |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The greater Phoenix region is home to the only thriving feral population of [[rosy-faced lovebird]]s in the U.S. This bird is a popular [[birdcage]] pet, native to southwestern Africa. Feral birds were first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These [[lovebird]]s prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed, dead [[palm tree]] fronds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://azfo.org/journal/Rosy-facedLovebird2011.html |title=Status of the Rosy-faced Lovebird in Phoenix, Arizona |first1=Kurt A. |last1=Radamaker |first2=Troy E. |last2=Corman |date=September 15, 2011 |work=Arizona Field Ornithologists |access-date=September 4, 2014}}</ref><ref name="PF-Lovebird">{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Greg |title=Peach-faced Lovebird Range Expansion Data in Greater Phoenix, Arizona Area |url=http://mirror-pole.com/collpage/pf_loveb/pfl_1.htm |access-date=February 27, 2011}}</ref>

The area is also home to a plethora of native reptile species including the [[Crotalus atrox|Western diamondback rattlesnake]], [[Crotalus cerastes cercobombus|Sonoran sidewinder]], several other types of rattlesnakes, [[Micruroides|Sonoran coral snake]], dozens of species of non-venomous snakes (including the [[Sonoran gopher snake]] and the [[California kingsnake]]), the [[gila monster]], [[Sceloporus magister|desert spiny lizard]], several types of [[Teiidae|whiptail lizards]], the [[chuckwalla]], [[desert horned lizard]], [[western banded gecko]], [[Sonora mud turtle]], and the [[desert tortoise]]. Native amphibian species include the [[Scaphiopus couchii|Couch's spadefoot toad]], [[Chiricahua leopard frog]], and the [[Incilius alvarius|Sonoran desert toad]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixsnakeremoval.com/snakes-of-phoenix.php |title=Common Snakes of the Phoenix Area |publisher=Phoenix Snake Removal |access-date=February 10, 2014}}</ref>

Phoenix and the surrounding areas are also home to a wide variety of native invertebrates including the [[Arizona bark scorpion]], [[giant desert hairy scorpion]], [[Arizona blond tarantula]], [[Sonoran Desert centipede]], [[tarantula hawk wasp]], [[solifugae|camel spider]], and [[amblypygi|tailless whip scorpion]]. Of great concern is the presence of [[Africanized bee]]s which can be extremely dangerous—even lethal—when provoked.

The Arizona Upland subdivision of the Sonoran Desert (of which Phoenix is a part) has "the most structurally diverse flora in the United States." One of the most well-known types of succulents, the [[Saguaro|giant saguaro cactus]], is found throughout the city and its neighboring environs. Other native species are the [[Stenocereus thurberi|organpipe]], [[Barrel cactus|barrel]], [[Fishhook cactus|fishhook]], [[Pachycereus schottii|senita]], [[Opuntia|prickly pear]] and [[Cylindropuntia|cholla]] cacti; [[Fouquieria|ocotillo]]; [[Parkinsonia aculeata|Palo Verde trees]] and [[Parkinsonia microphylla|foothill]] and [[Parkinsonia florida|blue paloverde]]; [[Washingtonia filifera|California fan palm]]; [[agave]]s; [[Yucca elata|soaptree yucca]], [[Hesperoyucca whipplei|Spanish bayonet]], [[Dasylirion wheeleri|desert spoon]], and [[Hesperaloe parviflora|red yucca]]; [[Olneya|ironwood]]; [[mesquite]]; and the [[Larrea tridentata|creosote bush]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.desertmuseum.org/center/swbiodiversity.php |title=Sonoran Desert Region Flora&nbsp;– Maricopa County |publisher=Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum |access-date=February 10, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222050828/http://www.desertmuseum.org/center/swbiodiversity.php |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://southwest.library.arizona.edu/azso/body.1_div.4.html |title=Natural Vegetation of Arizona |publisher=University of Arizona Library |access-date=February 10, 2014}}</ref>

After leading the U.S. in population growth for over a decade, the sub-prime mortgage crisis, followed by the recession, led to a slowing in the growth of Phoenix.

Phoenix's population has historically been predominantly white. From 1890 to 1970, over 90% of the citizens were white. In recent years, this percentage has dropped, reaching 65% in 2010. However, a large part of this decrease can be attributed to new guidelines put out by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] in 1980, when a question regarding Hispanic origin was added to the census questionnaire. This has led to an increasing tendency for some groups to no longer self-identify as white, and instead categorize themselves as "other races".<ref name="census">{{cite web|title=Arizona&nbsp;– Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |access-date=March 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

20.6% of the population of the city was foreign born in 2010.

About 15.7% of non-English speakers reported speaking English less than "very well". The largest national ancestries reported were Mexican (35.9%), German (15.3%), Irish (10.3%), English (9.4%), Black (6.5%), Italian (4.5%), French (2.7%), Polish (2.5%), American Indian (2.2%), and Scottish (2.0%).<ref name="SSC">{{cite web |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_1YR_DP02&prodType=table |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150316025439/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_1YR_DP02&prodType=table |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 16, 2015 |title=SELECTED SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS IN THE UNITED STATES: 2012 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |access-date=March 19, 2014}}</ref>

According to a 2014 study by the [[Pew Research Center]], 66% of the population of the city identified themselves as [[Christians]],<ref>[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/29/major-u-s-metropolitan-areas-differ-in-their-religious-profiles/ Major U.S. metropolitan areas differ in their religious profiles], Pew Research Center</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/ |title=America's Changing Religious Landscape |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion & Public Life |date=May 12, 2015}}</ref> while 26% claimed [[Irreligion|no religious affiliation]]. The same study says other religions (including [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]], and [[Hinduism]]) collectively make up about 7% of the population. In 2010, according to the Association of Religion Data Archives, which conducts religious census each ten years, 39% of those polled in Maricopa county considered themselves a member of a religious group. Of those who expressed a religious affiliation, the area's religious composition was reported as 35% [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], 22% to [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Protestant]] denominations, 16% [[Latter-Day Saints]] (LDS), 14% to [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational]] congregations, 7% to [[Mainline Protestant]] denominations, and 2% [[Hindu]]. The remaining 4% belong to other religions, such as Buddhism and Judaism.

While the number of religious adherents increased by 103,000 during the decade, the growth did not keep pace with the county's overall population increase of almost three-quarters of million individuals during the same period. The largest aggregate increases were in the LDS (a 58% increase) and Evangelical Protestant churches (14% increase), while all other categories saw their numbers drop slightly or remain static. The Catholic Church had an 8% drop, while mainline Protestant groups saw a 28% decline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/c/04/rcms2010_04013_county_tradition_2010.asp |title=2010 U.S. Religion Census: Religious Congregations & Membership Study. |publisher=The Association of Religious Data Archives |access-date=March 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429154429/http://www.thearda.com/rcms2010/r/c/04/rcms2010_04013_county_tradition_2010.asp |archive-date=April 29, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Crime===
[[File:Arizona State Capitol Executive Tower DSC 2708 ad.JPG|thumb|Arizona State Capitol Executive Tower at 1700 W. Washington St.]]
{{Main|Crime in Phoenix}}

By the 1960s, crime was a major problem in Phoenix, and by the 1970s crime continued to increase in the city at a faster rate than almost anywhere else in the country.{{sfn|VanderMeer|2010|p=252}} It was during this time frame when an incident occurred in Phoenix which would have national implications. On March 16, 1963, [[Ernesto Miranda]] was arrested and charged with rape. The subsequent Supreme Court ruling on June 13, 1966, Miranda v. Arizona, has led to practice in the United States of issuing a ''Miranda Warning'' to all suspected criminals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mirandawarning.org/historyofmirandawarning.html |title=History of Miranda Warning |publisher=mirandawarning.org |access-date=April 4, 2014}}</ref>

With Phoenix's rapid growth, one of the prime areas of criminal activity was land fraud. The practice became so widespread that newspapers would refer to Phoenix as ''the Tainted Desert''.{{sfn|VanderMeer|2010|pp=252–253}} These land frauds led to one of the more infamous murders in the history of the valley, when ''Arizona Republic'' writer [[Don Bolles]] was murdered by a car bomb in 1976.{{sfn|VanderMeer|2010|p=253}}{{sfn|Luckingham|1989|pp=211–212}} It was believed his investigative reporting on organized crime and land fraud in Phoenix made him a target.<ref name=AZCentral1>{{cite web |url=http://archive.azcentral.com/specials/special01/articles/0528bolles-overview.html |title=Journalism students revisit the death of Don Bolles |publisher=Arizona Republic/azcentral.com |date=March 28, 2006 |access-date=April 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140404185249/http://archive.azcentral.com/specials/special01/articles/0528bolles-overview.html |archive-date=April 4, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1993-02-10/news/the-bolles-trial-goes-into-reruns/full |title=The Bolles Trial Goes Into Reruns |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Tom |date=February 10, 1993 |website=Phoenix New Times |access-date=April 4, 2014}}</ref><ref name=bolles>{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special01/0528bolles-keyplayers.html |title=Key players in the Bolles' case |publisher=Arizona Republic/azcentral.com |access-date=February 19, 2014}}</ref>

Street gangs and the drug trade had turned into public safety issues by the 1980s, and the crime rate in Phoenix continued to grow.{{sfn|VanderMeer|2010|p=323}}

Phoenix auto traffic depends on both freeways and surface streets. Freeways fall under the auspices of the [[Arizona Department of Transportation]] (ADOT).

The street system in Phoenix (and some of its suburbs) is laid out in a grid system, with most roads oriented either north–south or east–west, and the zero point of the grid being the intersection of Central Avenue and Washington Street.<ref name=Discover /> The one notable exception to this is the diagonal [[Grand Avenue (Phoenix)|Grand Avenue]], which runs northwest–southeast. The original plan was for the east–west streets to be named after U.S. Presidents, with the north–south streets named after Native Americans; but the north–south streets were quickly changed to numbers, with numbered Avenues running to the west of Central, and numbered Streets to its east.<ref name=Phxgov />  Major arterial streets are spaced one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) apart, divided into smaller blocks approximately every {{convert|1/8|mi|m}}. For example, Scottsdale Road, being the 7200 block east, lies {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} to the east of Central Avenue (72 / 8).<ref name=Discover />
