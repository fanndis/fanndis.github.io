}}The '''Royal Academy of Engineering''' ('''RAEng''') is the UK's [[national academy]] of [[engineering]].

The Academy was founded in June 1976 as the '''Fellowship of Engineering''' with support from [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], who became the first Senior Fellow and, {{As of|2020|lc=on}}, remains so. The Fellowship was incorporated and granted a [[Royal Charter]] on 17 May 1983 and became the Royal Academy of Engineering on 16 March 1992. It is governed according to the Charter and associated Statutes and Regulations (as amended from time to time).<ref>{{cite web|title=RAEng: Charter, Statutes and Regulations|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/other/raeng-charter-statutes-regulations|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmsctech/774/77405.htm |title=The Royal Academy of Engineering |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |date={{Format date|2002|9|1|df=yes}} |accessdate={{Format date|2012|12|5|df=yes}}}}</ref>

==History==
Conceived in the late 1960s, during the Apollo space programme and [[Harold Wilson]]’s espousal of ‘[[white heat of technology]]’, the Fellowship of Engineering was born in the year of Concorde's first commercial flight.<ref>[http://www.britishairways.com/concorde/aboutconcorde.html#facts_figures Celebrating Concorde]. Britishairways.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-13.</ref>

The Fellowship's first meeting, at Buckingham Palace on 11 June 1976, enrolled 126 of the UK's leading engineers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/fellowship/founder_fellows/default.htm |title=Founder Fellows |publisher=Royal Academy of Engineering |date={{Format date|1976|6|10|df=yes}} |accessdate={{Format date|2012|12|5|df=yes}}}}</ref> The first fellows included [[Frank Whittle|Air Commodore Sir Frank Whittle]], the jet engine developer, the structural engineer [[Ove Arup|Sir Ove Arup]], radar pioneer [[George G. Macfarlane|Sir George MacFarlane]], the inventor of the bouncing bomb, [[Barnes Wallis|Sir Barnes Wallis]], and father of the UK computer industry [[Maurice Wilkes|Sir Maurice Wilkes]]. The Fellowship's first President, [[Christopher Hinton, Baron Hinton of Bankside|Lord Hinton]], had driven the UK's supremacy in nuclear power.<ref>[http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/history/earlydays.htm History of The Academy - Early Days]. Raeng.org.uk (1976-06-11). Retrieved on 2013-08-13.</ref>

The Fellowship focused on championing excellence in all fields of engineering. Activities began in earnest in the mid-1970s with the Distinction lecture series, now known as the Hinton lectures. The Fellowship was asked to advise the Department of Industry for the first time and the Academy became host and presenter of the MacRobert Award.<ref>[http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/history/establish.htm History of The Academy - 1976–1981: Establishing a track record]. Raeng.org.uk. Retrieved on 2013-08-13.</ref>

In the 1980s, the Fellowship received its own Royal Charter along with its first government grant-in-aid. At the same time it also received significant industrial funding, initiated its research programme to build bridges between academia and industry and opened its doors to International and Honorary Fellows.<ref>[http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/history/growing.htm History of The Academy - 1981–1986: Growing influence and activities]. Raeng.org.uk. Retrieved on 2013-08-13.</ref>

In 1990, the Academy launched its first major initiative in education, Engineering Education Continuum, which evolved into the BEST Programme<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020218224550/http://www.raeng.org.uk/education/best.htm]</ref> and Shape the Future and Tomorrow's Engineers.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011212837/http://www.raeng.org.uk/education/stf/default.htm]</ref>

The Academy's increasing level of influence – in policy, research and education – was recognised when it was granted a royal title and became The Royal Academy of Engineering in 1992.<ref>[http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/history/fromfellow.htm History of The Academy - 1991–1996: From Fellowship to Royal Academy].

==Logo==
The Academy's current logo<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.raeng.org.uk/publications/visual-identity-style-guide/logos|title= Academy logos}}</ref> is inspired by the Neolithic hand-axe, humans' first technological advance, which was taken to be a symbol appropriate to the Academy, supposedly representative of the ever-changing relationship between humanity and technology.<ref>[http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/housestyle/default.htm Visual Identity Guidelines]. Raeng.org.uk. Retrieved on 2013-08-13.</ref> The old logo is no longer in use but shown here for historical reasons.

==Prince Philip House==
The Academy's premises, 3-4 [[Carlton House Terrace]], are in a [[Grade I listed building]] overlooking [[St James's Park]], designed by celebrated architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and owned by the [[Crown Estates]]. The Academy shares the Terrace with two of its sister academies, the [[British Academy]] and the [[Royal Society]] as well as other institutes.

The building was renamed Prince Philip House,<ref>[http://www.princephiliphouse.com/ Home | Prince Philip House]</ref> in honour of the Senior Fellow, after renovation works were completed in 2012. Prince Philip House is also available for venue hire for meetings or events.

== Presidents  ==
The President of the Royal Academy of Engineering, the elected officer of the Academy, presides over meetings of the Council. The President is elected for a single term of not more than five years.

==Activities==
The Academy is instrumental in two policy alliances set up in 2009 to provide coherent advice on engineering education and policy across the profession: Education for Engineering<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationforengineering.org.uk/|title=Education for Engineering (E4E)|website=Education for Engineering (E4E)|accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref> and ''Engineering the Future''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringthefuture.co.uk|title=Engineering the Future|website=Engineering the Future|accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref>

The Academy is one of four agencies that receive funding from the UK's Department for Business Innovation & Skills for activities that support government policy on public understanding of science and engineering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-public-understanding-of-science-and-engineering/2010-to-2015-government-policy-public-understanding-of-science-and-engineering|title=2010 to 2015 government policy: public understanding of science and engineering|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref>

As part of its programme to communicate the benefits and value of engineering to society, the Academy publishes a quarterly magazine, Ingenia [https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034924/http://www.ingenia.org.uk/Online]. The Academy says that Ingenia is written for a non-specialist audience and is "aimed at all those with an interest in engineering, whether working in business and industry, government, academia or the financial community". The Academy also makes Ingenia available to A-Level students in 3,000 schools in the UK.

==Diversity==
The Academy strives to ensure that the pool of candidates for election to The Fellowship better reflects the diverse make-up of society as a whole. It set up the Proactive Membership Committee<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raeng.org.uk/about/fellowship/council/pro_active_membership.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213172155/http://raeng.org.uk/about/fellowship/council/pro_active_membership.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 December 2011|title=Council and Committees: Proactive Membership Committee|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=7 September 2018}}</ref> in 2008 to identify and support the nomination of candidates from underrepresented areas, with the aim of boosting the number of women candidates, engineers from industry and Small and Medium Enterprises, those from emerging technologies and ethnically diverse backgrounds.<ref>[http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/fellowship/council/pro_active_membership.htm Council and Committees: Proactive Membership Committee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213172155/http://raeng.org.uk/about/fellowship/council/pro_active_membership.htm |date=2011-12-13 }}.
