==Background and composition==
Bryson Tiller and Khaled had first collaborated on the track "Ima Be Alright" for Khaled's ninth studio album ''[[Major Key (album)|Major Key]]'' (2016).<ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Khaled Details Major Key Tracklist Featuring Kanye, Jay Z, Drake, Future, Kendrick Lamar, More|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/66348-dj-khaled-details-new-album-major-key-featuring-kanye-jay-z-drake-future-kendrick-lamar-more/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|accessdate=June 15, 2017|date=July 23, 2016}}</ref> During ''Grateful''{{'}}s recording, Khaled invited Tiller to his house for dinner. During dinner, Khaled played the initial demo of "Wild Thoughts" to Tiller and asked him if he could do something with the song. Tiller returned home and recorded his verse and sent it to Khaled who used it on the final recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a10252969/bryson-tiller-interview/|title=Bryson Tiller on How His Collab with Rihanna and DJ Khaled Came to Life|date=3 July 2017|website=harpersbazaar.com}}</ref> While talking about collaborating with Rihanna for the first time in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Khaled said; "Seven, eight years I've been trying to do this. I always put the kites out there that I wanted to work with her. But at the same time, while I was putting the kites out there, I was always getting the right record ready. You've gotta start with the right energy to see if something comes back that’s possible."<ref name="ew" />

Okoth-Obbo described the lyrics as straddling the line between "innuendos and carnal statements", whilst also noting the singers’ vocal performances as being restrained and controlled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/dj-khaled-wild-thoughts/|title="Wild Thoughts" Review – Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com}}</ref>

Peter A. Berry from ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' wrote; "If all goes according to plan, it should go follow in the footsteps of "[[I'm the One (DJ Khaled song)|I'm the One]]" and reach platinum status in the very near future."<ref name="xxl2" /> Janelle Okwode of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' said that the song "is an instant contender for song of the summer".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vogue.com/article/rihanna-dj-khaled-wild-thoughts-video-fashion-fantasy|title=Of Course DJ Khaled and Rihanna’s New Video is a Wild Fashion Fantasy|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=June 16, 2017|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref> Raisa Bruner from ''Time'' magazine listed the song on her list of five songs that should be heard. Bruner praised the song calling it an "irresistible, Latin-inflected summer jam with some smooth verses courtesy of the addition of Bryson Tiller." Bruner continued to state that the song was truly Rihanna's  "but we all know this is Rihanna's show."<ref name="auto" /> In a second and more in-depth review Burner stated:

{{cquote|"Wild Thoughts" kicks off with a bang and that instantly-recognizable Santana guitar melody, before segueing into Rihanna's low, compelling vocals and Tiller's verses. It feels like a spiritual successor to last year's hits "Work" and "One Dance" — but swapping those songs' dancehall vibes for Santana's guitar. Either way, it's an intoxicating bop guaranteed to heat things up.}}

[[Uproxx]]'s Corbin Reiff wrote that Rihanna "brings some serious heat", while Tiller "rolls through in the middle to reprise his verse, and brings some serious R&B vibes with along him".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/realtalk/dj-khaled-and-rihanna-wild-thoughts/|title=DJ Khaled And Rihanna Keep Things Smooth In Their Spanish-Flavored ‘Wild Thoughts’ Video|work=[[Uproxx]]|date=June 16, 2017|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref>
Matt Miller of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' praised Rihanna's saying that she "completely commands the song, the power of her voice, her presence takes the entire thing over." Miller was less favourable about Tiller and the Santana sample calling their inclusion forgettable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/news/a55683/dj-khaled-rihanna-wild-thoughts-video/|title=It Was Nice of Rihanna to Let DJ Khaled Put His Name on This Song|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=June 16, 2017|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref>
''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' editor Andrew Unterberger wrote that this is "practically a cover with different lyrics" of "Maria Maria", saying that it is "not a perfect song, but it's a super-fun resurrection of the now 18-year-old single".<ref name="auto1" /> Elias Leight from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called it "another warm-weather-friendly single" by Khaled.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/see-dj-khaled-rihanna-in-sultry-wild-thoughts-video-w488291|title=See DJ Khaled, Rihanna, Bryson Tiller in Sultry 'Wild Thoughts' Video|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 16, 2017|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref>

===Carlos Santana's response===
[[Carlos Santana]] who originally wrote "Maria Maria", the song which is sampled on "Wild Thoughts", praised Khaled's, Rihanna's and Tiller's take on the song. Stating "There is a reason that the infectious groove/theme that Wyclef and I created on 'Maria Maria' still resonates today. It speaks to the heart. DJ Khaled, Rihanna and Bryson take that vibe and bring it to a new dimension with 'Wild Thoughts,' but the groove and essence of the song is still intact." continuing to say, "I am honored that DJ Khaled, Rihanna & Bryson felt the intense intentionality of 'Maria Maria' and have shared this summer vibe with the world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/carlos-santana-approves-of-dj-khaled-rihanna-and-bryson-tillers-wild-thoughts-news.34054.html?|title=DJ Khaled, Rihanna & Bryson Tiller's "Wild Thoughts" Approved by Carlos Santana|publisher=}}</ref>

[[The Product G&B]] who originally sang "Maria Maria" had a mixed response to "Wild Thoughts". They stated they were grateful and called the song a "blessing" noting that when they hear "Wild Thoughts" "you hear 'Maria,' it’s bringing awareness all around." However they believed that "Wild Thoughts" had stripped the original of its meaning and "its association with West Side Story, where the musical's character "Maria" stood to represent both the grim reality of gang violence and poverty and the hope for a better life."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7849262/product-gb-maria-maria-wild-thoughts-sample-interview|title=Product G&B Talk Recording 'Maria Maria' & Being Sampled on 'Wild Thoughts' 17 Years Later: 'It's A Blessing'|website=billboard.com}}</ref>

Katie Skinner from ''Billboard Magazine'' gave an in-depth review of Rihanna's fashion throughout the music video. Skinner stated that the video had an "upbeat summer nightlife vibe in a tropical Miami setting" which "Rihanna and Khaled carry out that concept by dressing in bright-hued outfits, serving up some serious polychromatic summer looks straight off the runway."
During a breakdown of the video Skinner stated that Rihanna's first look saw her wearing a "psychedelic Balenciaga high-waisted floral-print leggings with matching "Knife" boots, a bright-pink vintage Betsey Johnson crop top and a pair of oversize crescent-shape Lynn Ban earrings." This was accompanied by a floral head scarf, green vintage Versace belt and a pair of pink Karen Walker sunglasses. In the following scene Rihanna wore a "short turquoise off-the-shoulder silk chiffon dress by Alberta Ferretti" along with a pair of gladiator sandals designed by Rihanna and Manolo Blahnik. During the last few seconds of the video, Rihanna stands beside Khaled and Tiller, wearing a bright nylon off-the-shoulder top and cargo pants designed by Matthew Adams Dolan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/lifestyle/7833840/rihanna-fashion-dj-khaled-wild-thoughts-video|title=Here Is Every Tropical Outfit Rihanna Wore in DJ Khaled's 'Wild Thoughts' Video|publisher=Billboard}}</ref>
