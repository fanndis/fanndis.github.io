A '''light-emitting diode''' ('''LED''') is a  [[semiconductor]] [[light source]] that emits light when [[Electric current|current]] flows through it. [[Electron]]s in the semiconductor recombine with [[electron hole]]s, releasing energy in the form of [[photon]]s. The color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photons) is determined by the energy required for electrons to cross the [[band gap]] of the semiconductor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/chem1l/files/2013/11/RDGLED.pdf |work=[[University of California at Irvine]] |access-date=12 January 2019 |title=Light Emitting Diodes |last=Edwards |first=Kimberly D. |page=2}}</ref> White light is obtained by using multiple semiconductors or a layer of light-emitting phosphor on the semiconductor device.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/nlpip/lightinganswers/led/whitelight.asp |title=How is white light made with LEDs? |work=[[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] |author=Lighting Research Center |access-date=12 January 2019}}</ref>

Appearing as practical electronic components in 1962, the earliest LEDs emitted low-intensity [[infrared]] (IR) light.<ref name=FirstPracticalLED /> Infrared LEDs are used in [[remote-control]] circuits, such as those used with a wide variety of consumer electronics. The first visible-light LEDs were of low intensity and limited to red. Modern LEDs are available across the [[visible spectrum|visible]], [[ultraviolet]] (UV), and infrared wavelengths, with high light output.

Early LEDs were often used as indicator lamps, replacing small incandescent bulbs, and in [[seven-segment display]]s. Recent developments have produced high-output white light LEDs suitable for room and outdoor area lighting. LEDs have led to new displays and sensors, while their high switching rates are useful in advanced communications technology.

LEDs have many advantages over incandescent light sources, including lower energy consumption, longer lifetime, improved physical robustness, smaller size, and faster switching. LEDs are used in applications as diverse as [[navigation light#Aviation navigation lights|aviation lighting]], [[automotive lighting#Light emitting diodes (LED)|automotive headlamps]], advertising, [[Lighting|general lighting]], [[traffic signal]]s, camera flashes, [[LED wallpaper|lighted wallpaper]], [[Grow light|horticultural grow lights]], and medical devices.<ref name=Aguilar>{{Cite book|pmid=18002450|doi= 10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352784|year= 2007|last1= Peláez|first1= E.

Unlike a [[laser]], the light emitted from an LED is neither spectrally [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] nor even highly [[monochromatic]]. However, its [[Spectrum#Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] is sufficiently narrow that it appears to the [[color vision|human eye]] as a pure ([[Colorfulness#Saturation|saturated]]) color.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/ssl/led-basics|title=LED Basics {{!}} Department of Energy|website=www.energy.gov|access-date=2018-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://optiwave.com/resources/applications-resources/optical-system-led-spectral-distribution/|title=LED Spectral Distribution|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=optiwave.com  |access-date=20 June 2017|date=2013-07-25}}</ref> Also unlike most lasers, its radiation is not [[Coherence (physics)#Spatial coherence|spatially coherent]], so it cannot approach the very high [[Radiance|brightness]]es characteristic of [[laser]]s.

In 1936, [[Georges Destriau]] observed that electroluminescence could be produced when [[zinc sulphide]] (ZnS) powder is suspended in an insulator and an alternating electrical field is applied to it. In his publications, Destriau often referred to luminescence as Losev-Light. Destriau worked in the laboratories of Madame [[Marie Curie]], also an early pioneer in the field of luminescence with research on [[radium]].<ref name="ChemiePhysique">{{Cite journal|author=Destriau, G.|year=1936|title=Recherches sur les scintillations des sulfures de zinc aux rayons|journal=Journal de Chimie Physique|volume=33|pages=587–625|doi=10.1051/jcp/1936330587

Hungarian [[Zoltán Bay]]  together with [[György Szigeti]]  pre-empted LED lighting in Hungary in 1939 by patenting a lighting device based on SiC, with an option on boron carbide, that emitted white, yellowish white, or greenish white depending on impurities present.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iitk.ac.in/solarlighting/files/brief_history_of_LEDs.pdf|title=Brief history of LEDs}}</ref>

[[Kurt Lehovec]], Carl Accardo, and Edward Jamgochian explained these first LEDs in 1951 using an apparatus employing [[silicon carbide|SiC]] crystals with a current source of a battery or a pulse generator and with a comparison to a variant, pure, crystal in 1953.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=1951|title=Injected Light Emission of Silicon Carbide Crystals|journal=Physical Review|volume=83|issue=3|pages=603–607|url=http://www.campevans.org/_CE/html/tpr-08-01-1951p604-lehovec.html|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.83.603|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211015103/http://www.campevans.org/_CE/html/tpr-08-01-1951p604-lehovec.html|archive-date=December 11, 2014|df=mdy-all|bibcode=1951PhRv...83..603L|last1=Lehovec|first1=K|last2=Accardo|first2=C.

In 1957, Braunstein further demonstrated that the rudimentary devices could be used for non-radio communication across a short distance.  As noted by Kroemer<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kroemer |first1=Herbert |title=The Double-Heterostructure Concept: How It Got Started |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|date=Sep 16, 2013 |volume=101 |issue=10 |pages=2183–2187 |doi=10.1109/JPROC.2013.2274914|s2cid=2554978 }}</ref> Braunstein "…had set up a simple optical communications link: Music emerging from a record player was used via suitable electronics to modulate the forward current of a GaAs diode. The emitted light was detected by a PbS diode some distance away. This signal was fed into an audio amplifier and played back by a loudspeaker. Intercepting the beam stopped the music. We had a great deal of fun playing with this setup." This setup presaged the use of LEDs for [[optical communication]] applications.

===Initial commercial development===
The first commercial visible-wavelength LEDs were commonly used as replacements for [[incandescence|incandescent]] and [[neon lamp|neon indicator lamps]], and in [[seven-segment display]]s,<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.datamath.org/Display/Monsanto.htm | title=LEDs cast Monsanto in Unfamiliar Role | author=Rostky, George | journal=Electronic Engineering Times |date=March 1997 | issue=944}}</ref> first in expensive equipment such as laboratory and electronics test equipment, then later in such appliances as calculators, TVs, radios, telephones,  as well as watches (see list of [[#Indicators and signs|signal uses]]).
Until 1968, visible and infrared LEDs were extremely costly, in the order of [[United States dollar|US$]]200 per unit, and so had little practical use.<ref name="Schubert" />

[[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) was engaged in [[research and development]] (R&D) on practical LEDs between 1962 and 1968, by a research team under Howard C. Borden, Gerald P. Pighini and [[Mohamed M.

[[File:TI-30-LED-Display-3682e1.jpg|thumb|LED display of a [[TI-30]] scientific calculator (ca. 1978), which uses plastic lenses to increase the visible digit size]]

The early red LEDs were bright enough only for use as indicators, as the light output was not enough to illuminate an area. Readouts in calculators were so small that plastic lenses were built over each digit to make them legible. Later, other colors became widely available and appeared in appliances and equipment.

Early LEDs were packaged in metal cases similar to those of transistors, with a glass window or lens to let the light out. Modern indicator LEDs are packed in transparent molded plastic cases, tubular or rectangular in shape, and often tinted to match the device color. Infrared devices may be dyed, to block visible light. More complex packages have been adapted for efficient heat dissipation in  [[#High-power|high-power LEDs]]. Surface-mounted LEDs further reduce the package size. LEDs intended for use with [[fiber optics]] cables may be provided with an optical connector.

===Blue LED===
The first blue-violet LED using magnesium-doped [[gallium nitride]] was made at [[Stanford University]] in 1972 by Herb Maruska and Wally Rhines, doctoral students in materials science and engineering.<ref>[https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/geek-life/history/rcas-forgotten-work-on-the-blue-led "Nobel Shocker: RCA Had the First Blue LED in 1972"].

''The Oregonian''. October 16, 2014</ref> At the time Maruska was on leave from [[RCA|RCA Laboratories]], where he collaborated with Jacques Pankove on related work. In 1971, the year after Maruska left for Stanford, his RCA colleagues Pankove and Ed Miller demonstrated the first blue electroluminescence from zinc-doped gallium nitride, though the subsequent device Pankove and Miller built, the first actual gallium nitride light-emitting diode, emitted green light.<ref>Schubert, E.

Today, magnesium-doping of gallium nitride remains the basis for all commercial blue LEDs and [[laser diode]]s. In the early 1970s, these devices were too dim for practical use, and research into gallium nitride devices slowed.

===White LEDs and the illumination breakthrough===
Even though white light can be created using individual red, green and blue LEDs, this results in poor color rendering, since only three narrow bands of wavelengths of light are being emitted. The attainment of high efficiency blue LEDs was quickly followed by the development of the first [[#Phosphor-based LEDs|white LED]]. In this device a {{chem|Y|3|Al|5|O|12}}:Ce (known as "[[YAG]]" or Ce:YAG phosphor) [[cerium]] doped phosphor coating produces yellow light through [[fluorescence]]. The combination of that yellow with remaining blue light appears white to the eye. Using different [[phosphor]]s produces green and red light through fluorescence. The resulting mixture of red, green and blue is perceived as white light, with improved [[color rendering]] compared to  wavelengths from the blue LED/YAG phosphor combination.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

[[File:Haitz-law.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|Illustration of [[Haitz's law]], showing improvement in light output per LED over time, with a logarithmic scale on the vertical axis]]

The first white LEDs were expensive and inefficient. However, the light output of LEDs has increased [[exponential growth|exponentially]]. The latest research and development has been propagated by Japanese manufacturers such as [[Panasonic]], and [[Nichia]], and  by Korean and Chinese manufacturers such as [[Samsung]], Kingsun, and others.  This trend in increased output has been called [[Haitz's law]] after Dr. Roland Haitz.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/nphoton.2006.78|title=Haitz's law|year=2007|journal=[[Nature Photonics]]|volume=1|page=23|issue=1|bibcode = 2007NaPho...1...23. |doi-access=free}}</ref>

Light output and efficiency of blue and near-ultraviolet LEDs rose and the cost of reliable devices fell. This led to relatively high-power white-light LEDs for illumination, which are replacing incandescent and fluorescent lighting.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.electrooptics.com/features/junjul06/junjul06leds.html | title=LED there be light, Nick Morris predicts a bright future for LEDs | website=Electrooptics.com | date=1 June 2006 | first=Nick| last=Morris }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/27/incandescent-led-cfl-pf-guru_in_mm_0227energy_inl.html|title=The LED Illumination Revolution|journal=[[Forbes]]|date=February 27, 2008}}</ref>

The LED chip is encapsulated inside a small, plastic, white mold. It can be encapsulated using resin ([[polyurethane]]-based), silicone, or epoxy containing (powdered) Cerium doped YAG phosphor. After allowing the solvents to evaporate, the LEDs are often tested, and placed on tapes for [[SMT placement equipment]] for use in LED light bulb production.  Encapsulation is performed after probing, dicing, die transfer from wafer to package, and wire bonding or flip chip mounting, perhaps using [[Indium tin oxide]], a transparent electrical conductor. In this case, the bond wire(s) are attached to the ITO film that has been deposited in the LEDs.
Some "remote phosphor" LED light bulbs use a single plastic cover with YAG phosphor for several blue LEDs, instead of using phosphor coatings on single chip white LEDs.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

== Physics of light production and emission ==
{{main|Light-emitting diode physics}}
In a light emitting diode, the recombination of electrons and electron holes in a semiconductor produces light (be it infrared, visible or UV), a process called "[[electroluminescence]]". The wavelength of the light depends on the energy [[band gap]] of the semiconductors used. Since these materials have a high index of refraction, design features of the devices such as special optical coatings and die shape are required to efficiently emit light.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

==Colors ==
By [[Light-emitting diode physics#Materials|selection of different semiconductor materials]], single-color LEDs can be made that emit light in a narrow band of wavelengths from near-infrared through the visible spectrum and into the ultraviolet range.  As the wavelengths become shorter, because of the larger band gap of these semiconductors, the operating voltage of the LED increases.

===Blue and ultraviolet===

Blue LEDs have an active region consisting of one or more InGaN [[quantum well]]s sandwiched between thicker layers of GaN, called cladding layers. By varying the relative In/Ga fraction in the InGaN quantum wells, the light emission can in theory be varied from violet to amber.

[[Aluminium gallium nitride]] (AlGaN) of varying Al/Ga fraction can be used to manufacture the cladding and quantum well layers for ultraviolet LEDs, but these devices have not yet reached the level of efficiency and technological maturity of InGaN/GaN blue/green devices. If un-alloyed GaN is used in this case to form the active quantum well layers, the device emits near-ultraviolet light with a peak wavelength centred around 365&nbsp;nm. Green LEDs manufactured from the InGaN/GaN system are far more efficient and brighter than green LEDs produced with non-nitride material systems, but practical devices still exhibit efficiency too low for high-brightness applications.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===White===
There are two primary ways of producing [[white]] light-emitting diodes. One is to use individual LEDs that emit three [[primary color]]s—red, green and blue—and then mix all the colors to form white light. The other is to use a phosphor material to convert monochromatic light from a blue or UV LED to broad-spectrum white light, similar to a [[fluorescent lamp]].  The yellow phosphor is [[cerium]]-doped [[YAG]] crystals suspended in the package or coated on the LED. This YAG phosphor causes white LEDs to appear yellow when off, and the space between the crystals allow some blue light to pass through. Alternatively, white LEDs may use other phosphors like manganese(IV)-doped [[potassium fluorosilicate]] (PFS) or other engineered phosphors. PFS assists in red light generation, and is used in conjunction with conventional Ce:YAG phosphor. In LEDs with PFS phosphor, some blue light passes through the phosphors, the Ce:YAG phosphor converts blue light to green and red light, and the PFS phosphor converts blue light to red light. The color temperature of the LED can be controlled by changing the concentration of the phosphors.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ledinside.com/news/2014/11/seeing_red_with_pfs_phosphor |title = Seeing Red with PFS Phosphor}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ledsmagazine.com/architectural-lighting/retail-hospitality/article/16696629/ge-lighting-manufactures-pfs-red-phosphor-for-led-display-backlight-applications | title=GE Lighting manufactures PFS red phosphor for LED display backlight applications| date=March 31, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.geradiantred.com/trigain-phosphor/ |title = GE TriGain® Phosphor Technology &#124; GE}}</ref>

The 'whiteness' of the light produced is engineered to suit the human eye. Because of [[Metamerism (color)|metamerism]], it is possible to have quite different spectra that appear white. The appearance of objects illuminated by that light may vary as the spectrum varies. This is the issue of color rendition, quite separate from color temperature. An orange or cyan object could appear with the wrong color and much darker as the LED or phosphor does not emit the wavelength it reflects. The best color rendition LEDs use a mix of phosphors, resulting in less efficiency and better color rendering.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

====RGB systems====
[[File:RGB_LED_Spectrum.svg|thumb|right|Combined spectral curves for blue, yellow-green, and high-brightness red solid-state semiconductor LEDs. [[Full width at half maximum|FWHM]] spectral bandwidth is approximately 24–27 nm for all three colors.]]

[[File:RGB LED.jpg|thumb|RGB LED]]

Mixing red, green, and blue sources to produce white light needs electronic circuits to control the blending of the colors.  Since  LEDs have slightly different emission patterns, the color balance may change depending on the angle of view, even if the RGB sources are in a single package, so RGB diodes are seldom used to produce white lighting. Nonetheless, this method has many applications because of the flexibility of mixing different colors,<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1364/OE.15.003607 | last1 = Moreno | first1 = I. | last2 = Contreras | first2 = U. | title = Color distribution from multicolor LED arrays | journal = Optics Express | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 3607–3618 | year = 2007 | pmid = 19532605| bibcode = 2007OExpr..15.3607M | s2cid = 35468615 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/20fc0af4b06b64519fb98c9f6b546087ebc087a4 }}</ref> and in principle, this mechanism also has higher quantum efficiency in producing white light.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spie.org/newsroom/1069-making-white-light-emitting-diodes-without-phosphors?SSO=1|title=Making white-light-emitting diodes without phosphors {{!}} SPIE Homepage: SPIE|last1=Yeh|first1=Dong-Ming|last2=Huang|first2=Chi-Feng|website=spie.org|access-date=2019-04-07|last3=Lu|first3=Chih-Feng|last4=Yang|first4=Chih-Chung}}</ref>

There are several types of multicolor white LEDs: [[:wiktionary:dichromatic|di-]], [[trichromatic|tri-]], and [[tetrachromatic]] white LEDs. Several key factors that play among these different methods include color stability, [[color rendering index|color rendering]] capability, and luminous efficacy. Often, higher efficiency means lower color rendering, presenting a trade-off between the luminous efficacy and color rendering. For example, the dichromatic white LEDs have the best luminous efficacy (120 lm/W), but the lowest color rendering capability. Although tetrachromatic white LEDs have excellent color rendering capability, they often have poor luminous efficacy. Trichromatic white LEDs are in between, having both good luminous efficacy (>70 lm/W) and fair color rendering capability.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

One of the challenges is the development of more efficient green LEDs. The theoretical maximum for green LEDs is 683 lumens per watt but as of 2010 few green LEDs exceed even 100 lumens per watt. The blue and red LEDs approach their theoretical limits.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Multicolor LEDs also offer a new means to form light of different colors. Most [[color#Perception|perceivable colors]] can be formed by mixing different amounts of three primary colors. This allows precise dynamic color control. However, this type of LED's emission power [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] with rising temperature,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Schubert |first1=E. Fred |last2=Kim |first2=Jong Kyu |journal=Science |volume=308 |issue=5726 |doi=10.1126/science.1108712 |pmid=15919985 |pages=1274–1278 |year=2005 |title=Solid-State Light Sources Getting Smart |bibcode=2005Sci...308.1274S |s2cid=6354382 |url=https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~schubert/Reprints/2005%20Schubert%20and%20Kim%20(Science)%20Solid-state%20light%20sources%20getting%20smart.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205165109/https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~schubert/Reprints/2005%20Schubert%20and%20Kim%20(Science)%20Solid-state%20light%20sources%20getting%20smart.pdf |archive-date=February 5, 2016 }}</ref>
resulting in a substantial change in color stability. Such problems inhibit industrial use. Multicolor LEDs without phosphors cannot provide good color rendering because each LED is a narrowband source. LEDs without phosphor, while a poorer solution for general lighting, are the best solution for displays, either backlight of LCD, or direct LED based pixels.

Dimming a multicolor LED source to match the characteristics of incandescent lamps is difficult because manufacturing variations, age, and temperature change the actual color value output. To emulate the appearance of dimming incandescent lamps may require a feedback system with color sensor to actively monitor and control the color.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Sensors and Feedback Control of Multicolor LED Systems | format = PDF | first1 = Thomas | last1 = Nimz | first2 = Fredrik | last2 = Hailer | first3 = Kevin | last3 = Jensen | journal = Led Professional Review : Trends & Technologie for Future Lighting Solutions | publisher = LED Professional | date = November 2012 | issue = 34 | issn = 1993-890X | pages = 2–5 | url = http://www.mazet.de/en/english-documents/english/featured-articles/sensors-and-feedback-control-of-multi-color-led-systems-1/download#.UX7VXYIcUZI | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140429162806/http://www.mazet.de/en/english-documents/english/featured-articles/sensors-and-feedback-control-of-multi-color-led-systems-1/download#.UX7VXYIcUZI | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2014-04-29 }}</ref>

====Phosphor-based LEDs====
[[File:White LED.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Spectrum of a white LED showing blue light directly emitted by the GaN-based LED (peak at about 465 nm) and the more broadband [[Stokes shift|Stokes-shifted]] light emitted by the Ce<sup>3+</sup>:YAG phosphor, which emits at roughly 500–700 nm]]

This method involves [[coating]] LEDs of one color (mostly blue LEDs made of [[InGaN]]) with [[phosphor]]s of different colors to form white light; the resultant LEDs are called phosphor-based or phosphor-converted white LEDs (pcLEDs).<ref>{{cite journal|title=YAG glass-ceramic phosphor for white LED (II): luminescence characteristics|author1=Tanabe, S. |author2=Fujita, S. |author3=Yoshihara, S. |author4=Sakamoto, A. |author5=Yamamoto, S.|journal=Proceedings of SPIE|url=http://lib.semi.ac.cn:8080/tsh/dzzy/wsqk/SPIE/vol5941/594112.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511182527/http://lib.semi.ac.cn:8080/tsh/dzzy/wsqk/SPIE/vol5941/594112.pdf|archive-date=2011-05-11|volume=5941|doi=10.1117/12.614681|page=594112|year=2005|series=Fifth International Conference on Solid State Lighting|bibcode=2005SPIE.5941..193T |s2cid=38290951 |editor1-last=Ferguson |editor1-first=Ian T |editor2-last=Carrano |editor2-first=John C |editor3-last=Taguchi |editor3-first=Tsunemasa |editor4-last=Ashdown |editor4-first=Ian E }}</ref>  A fraction of the blue light undergoes the Stokes shift, which transforms it from shorter wavelengths to longer.  Depending on the original LED's color, various color phosphors are used.  Using several phosphor layers of distinct colors broadens the emitted spectrum, effectively raising the [[Color Rendering Index|color rendering index]] (CRI).<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Color rendering and luminous efficacy of white LED spectra|author=Ohno, Y.|journal=Proc. SPIE|doi=10.1117/12.565757|url=http://lib.semi.ac.cn:8080/tsh/dzzy/wsqk/SPIE/vol5530/5530-88.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511182632/http://lib.semi.ac.cn:8080/tsh/dzzy/wsqk/SPIE/vol5530/5530-88.pdf|archive-date=2011-05-11|volume=5530|page=89|year=2004|series=Fourth International Conference on Solid State Lighting|bibcode=2004SPIE.5530...88O|s2cid=122777225|editor1-last=Ferguson|editor1-first=Ian T|editor2-last=Narendran|editor2-first=Nadarajah|editor3-last=Denbaars|editor3-first=Steven P|editor4-last=Carrano|editor4-first=John C}}</ref>

Phosphor-based LEDs have efficiency losses due to heat loss from the [[Stokes shift]] and also other phosphor-related issues. Their luminous efficacies compared to normal LEDs depend on the spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the LED itself. For example, the luminous efficacy of a typical YAG yellow phosphor based white LED ranges from 3 to 5 times the luminous efficacy of the original blue LED because of the human eye's greater sensitivity to yellow than to blue (as modeled in the [[luminosity function]]). Due to the simplicity of manufacturing, the phosphor method is still the most popular method for making high-intensity white LEDs. The design and production of a light source or light fixture using a monochrome emitter with phosphor conversion is simpler and cheaper than a complex [[#RGB systems|RGB]] system, and the majority of high-intensity white LEDs presently on the market are manufactured using phosphor light conversion.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Among the challenges being faced to improve the efficiency of LED-based white light sources is the development of more efficient phosphors. As of 2010, the most efficient yellow phosphor is still the YAG phosphor, with less than 10% Stokes shift loss. Losses attributable to internal optical losses due to re-absorption in the LED chip and in the LED packaging itself account typically for another 10% to 30% of efficiency loss. Currently, in the area of phosphor LED development, much effort is being spent on optimizing these devices to higher light output and higher operation temperatures. For instance, the efficiency can be raised by adapting better package design or by using a more suitable type of phosphor. Conformal coating process is frequently used to address the issue of varying phosphor thickness.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Some phosphor-based white LEDs encapsulate InGaN blue LEDs inside phosphor-coated epoxy. Alternatively, the LED might be paired with a remote phosphor, a preformed polycarbonate piece coated with the phosphor material. Remote phosphors provide more diffuse light, which is desirable for many applications. Remote phosphor designs are also more tolerant of variations in the LED emissions spectrum. A common yellow phosphor material is [[cerium]]-[[Doping (Semiconductors)|doped]] [[yttrium aluminium garnet]] (Ce<sup>3+</sup>:YAG).{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

White LEDs can also be made by [[coating]] near-ultraviolet (NUV) LEDs with a mixture of high-efficiency [[europium]]-based phosphors that emit red and blue, plus copper and aluminium-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu, Al) that emits green. This is a method analogous to the way [[fluorescent lamp]]s work. This method is less efficient than blue LEDs with YAG:Ce phosphor, as the Stokes shift is larger, so more energy is converted to heat, but yields light with better spectral characteristics, which render color better. Due to the higher radiative output of the ultraviolet LEDs than of the blue ones, both methods offer comparable brightness. A concern is that UV light may leak from a malfunctioning light source and cause harm to human eyes or skin.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

====Other white LEDs====
Another method used to produce experimental white light LEDs used no phosphors at all and was based on [[epitaxy|homoepitaxially]] grown [[zinc selenide]] (ZnSe) on a ZnSe substrate that simultaneously emitted blue light from its active region and yellow light from the substrate.<ref>{{cite web| title = Joint venture to make ZnSe white LEDs| date = December 6, 2002| author = Whitaker, Tim| url = http://optics.org/cws/article/research/16534| access-date = January 3, 2009}}</ref>

A new style of wafers composed of gallium-nitride-on-silicon (GaN-on-Si) is being used to produce white LEDs using 200-mm silicon wafers. This avoids the typical costly [[sapphire]] [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] in relatively small 100- or 150-mm wafer sizes.<ref name="electronicdesign.com">[http://electronicdesign.com/europe-news/next-generation-gan-si-white-leds-suppress-costs Next-Generation GaN-on-Si White LEDs Suppress Costs], Electronic Design, 19 November 2013</ref> The sapphire apparatus must be coupled with a mirror-like collector to reflect light that would otherwise be wasted. It was predicted that since 2020, 40% of all GaN LEDs are made with GaN-on-Si. Manufacturing large sapphire material is difficult, while large silicon material is cheaper and more abundant. LED companies shifting from using sapphire to silicon should be a minimal investment.<ref>[http://www.isuppli.com/Semiconductor-Value-Chain/News/Pages/GaN-on-Silicon-LEDs-Forecast-to-Increase-Market-Share-to-40Percent-by-2020.aspx GaN-on-Silicon LEDs Forecast to Increase Market Share to 40 Percent by 2020], iSuppli, 4 December 2013</ref>

==Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)==
{{Main|Organic light-emitting diode}}

In an organic light-emitting diode ([[Organic light-emitting diode|OLED]]), the [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] material composing the emissive layer of the diode is an [[organic compound]]. The organic material is electrically conductive due to the [[Delocalized electron|delocalization]] of [[Pi bond|pi electrons]] caused by [[Conjugated system|conjugation]] over all or part of the molecule, and the material therefore functions as an [[organic semiconductor]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1 = Burroughes |first1 = J.

==Types==
[[File:Verschiedene LEDs.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.4|LEDs are produced in a variety of shapes and sizes. The color of the plastic lens is often the same as the actual color of light emitted, but not always. For instance, purple plastic is often used for infrared LEDs, and most blue devices have colorless housings. Modern high-power LEDs such as those used for lighting and backlighting are generally found in [[surface-mount technology]] (SMT) packages (not shown).]]

LEDs are made in different packages for different applications. A single or a few LED junctions may be packed in one miniature device for use as an indicator or pilot lamp. An LED array may include controlling circuits within the same package, which may range from a simple resistor, blinking or color changing control, or an addressable controller for RGB devices.  Higher-powered white-emitting devices will be mounted on heat sinks and will be used for illumination. Alphanumeric displays in dot matrix or bar formats are widely available. Special packages permit connection of LEDs to optical fibers for high-speed data communication links.

Some can emit over a thousand lumens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luminus.com/content1044|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725033952/http://www.luminus.com/content1044 |archive-date=2008-07-25|title=Luminus Products |publisher=Luminus Devices |access-date=October 21, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luminus.com/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/7c8547b3575bcecc577525b80d210ac7/misc/pds_001314_rev_03__cst_90_w_product_datasheet_illumination.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331100545/http://www.luminus.com/stuff/contentmgr/files/0/7c8547b3575bcecc577525b80d210ac7/misc/pds_001314_rev_03__cst_90_w_product_datasheet_illumination.pdf |archive-date=2010-03-31|title=Luminus Products CST-90 Series Datasheet |publisher=Luminus Devices |access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref> LED [[Power density|power densities]] up to 300 W/cm<sup>2</sup> have been achieved. Since overheating is destructive, the HP-LEDs must be mounted on a heat sink to allow for heat dissipation. If the heat from an HP-LED is not removed, the device fails in seconds. One HP-LED can often replace an incandescent bulb in a [[flashlight]], or be set in an array to form a powerful [[LED lamp]].

Some well-known HP-LEDs in this category are the Nichia 19 series, Lumileds Rebel Led, Osram Opto Semiconductors Golden Dragon, and Cree X-lamp. As of September 2009, some HP-LEDs manufactured by Cree now exceed 105&nbsp;lm/W.<ref name="Xlamp Xp-G Led">{{cite web|url=http://www.cree.com/products/xlamp_xpg.asp |title=Xlamp Xp-G Led |website=Cree.com |publisher=[[Cree, Inc.]] |access-date=March 16, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313082324/http://www.cree.com/products/xlamp_xpg.asp |archive-date=March 13, 2012 }}</ref>

Examples for [[Haitz's law]]—which predicts an exponential rise in light output and efficacy of LEDs over time—are the CREE XP-G series LED, which achieved 105{{nbsp}}lm/W in 2009<ref name="Xlamp Xp-G Led" /> and the Nichia 19 series with a typical efficacy of 140{{nbsp}}lm/W, released in 2010.<ref>[http://www.nichia.co.jp/en/about_nichia/2010/2010_110201.html High Power Point Source White Led NVSx219A]. Nichia.co.jp, November 2, 2010.</ref>

===AC-driven===
LEDs developed by Seoul Semiconductor can operate on AC power without a DC converter. For each half-cycle, part of the LED emits light and part is dark, and this is reversed during the next half-cycle. The efficacy of this type of HP-LED is typically 40{{nbsp}}lm/W.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ledsmagazine.com/news/3/11/14|title=Seoul Semiconductor launches AC LED lighting source Acrich |publisher=LEDS Magazine |access-date=February 17, 2008|date=November 17, 2006}}</ref> A large number of LED elements in series may be able to operate directly from line voltage. In 2009, Seoul Semiconductor released a high DC voltage LED, named as 'Acrich MJT', capable of being driven from AC power with a simple controlling circuit. The low-power dissipation of these LEDs affords them more flexibility than the original AC LED design.<ref name="IDA" />

===Application-specific variations===
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2020}}

====Flashing====
Flashing LEDs are used as attention seeking indicators without requiring external electronics. Flashing LEDs resemble standard LEDs but they contain an integrated [[voltage regulator]] and a [[multivibrator]] circuit that causes the LED to flash with a typical period of one second. In diffused lens LEDs, this circuit is visible as a small black dot. Most flashing LEDs emit light of one color, but more sophisticated devices can flash between multiple colors and even fade through a color sequence using RGB color mixing.

====Bi-color====
Bi-color LEDs contain two different LED emitters in one case. There are two types of these. One type consists of two dies connected to the same two leads [[Antiparallel (electronics)|antiparallel]] to each other. Current flow in one direction emits one color, and current in the opposite direction emits the other color. The other type consists of two dies with separate leads for both dies and another lead for common anode or cathode so that they can be controlled independently.  The most common bi-color combination is red/traditional green, however, other available combinations include amber/traditional green, red/pure green, red/blue, and blue/pure green.

====RGB Tri-color====
Tri-color LEDs contain three different LED emitters in one case. Each emitter is connected to a separate lead so they can be controlled independently. A four-lead arrangement is typical with one common lead (anode or cathode) and an additional lead for each color. Others, however, have only two leads (positive and negative) and have a built-in electronic controller. 
[[File:RGB-SMD-LED.jpg|thumb|RGB-SMD-LED]]

[[RGB color model|RGB]] LEDs consist of one red, one green, and one blue LED.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qk1hmpEQVxIC&pg=PA349 |title=5th Kuala Lumpur International Conference on Biomedical Engineering 2011: BIOMED 2011, 20–23 June 2011, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia |last=Ting |first=Hua-Nong |date=2011-06-17|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=9783642217296}}</ref> By independently [[pulse-width modulation|adjusting]] each of the three, RGB LEDs are capable of producing a wide color gamut. Unlike dedicated-color LEDs, however, these do not produce pure wavelengths. Modules may not be optimized for smooth color mixing.

====Decorative-multicolor====
Decorative-multicolor LEDs incorporate several emitters of different colors supplied by only two lead-out wires. Colors are switched internally by varying the supply voltage.

====Alphanumeric====
[[File:Macro photo of LED matrix.jpg|thumb|Composite image of an {{nowrap|11 × 44}} LED matrix lapel [[name tag]] display using 1608/0603-type SMD LEDs. Top: A little over half of the {{nowrap|21 × 86 mm}} display. Center: Close-up of LEDs in ambient light. Bottom: LEDs in their own red light.]]
Alphanumeric LEDs are available in [[seven-segment display|seven-segment]], [[Starburst display|starburst]], and [[Dot-matrix display|dot-matrix]] format. Seven-segment displays handle all numbers and a limited set of letters. Starburst displays can display all letters. Dot-matrix displays typically use 5×7 pixels per character. Seven-segment LED displays were in widespread use in the 1970s and 1980s, but rising use of [[liquid crystal display]]s, with their lower power needs and greater display flexibility, has reduced the popularity of numeric and alphanumeric LED displays.

====Digital RGB====
Digital RGB addressable LEDs contain their own "smart" control electronics. In addition to power and ground, these provide connections for data-in, data-out, clock and sometimes a strobe signal. These are connected in a [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]]. Data sent to the first LED of the chain can control the brightness and color of each LED independently of the others. They are used where a combination of maximum control and minimum visible electronics are needed such as strings for Christmas and LED matrices. Some even have refresh rates in the kHz range, allowing for basic video applications. These devices are known by their part number (WS2812 being common) or a brand name such as [[Adafruit Industries#NeoPixel|NeoPixel]].

====Filament====
An [[LED filament]] consists of multiple LED chips connected in series on a common longitudinal substrate that forms a thin rod reminiscent of a traditional incandescent filament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ledinside.com/knowledge/2015/2/the_next_generation_of_led_filament_bulbs|title=The Next Generation of LED Filament Bulbs|website=LEDInside.com|publisher=Trendforce|access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref> These are being used as a low-cost decorative alternative for traditional light bulbs that are being phased out in many countries. The filaments use a rather high voltage, allowing them to work efficiently with mains voltages. Often a simple rectifier and capacitive current limiting are employed to create a low-cost replacement for a traditional light bulb without the complexity of the low voltage, high current converter that single die LEDs need.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_XiunR-cAQ|title=LED Filaments|access-date=October 26, 2015}}</ref> Usually, they are packaged in bulb similar to the lamps they were designed to replace, and filled with inert gas to remove heat efficiently.

====Chip-on-board arrays====
Surface-mounted LEDs are frequently produced in [[chip on board]] (COB) arrays,  allowing better heat dissipation than with a single LED of comparable luminous output.<ref>{{cite book|title=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths: Including Actinides|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lO_lCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA89|date=1 August 2016|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-444-63705-5|page=89}}</ref>  The LEDs can be arranged around a cylinder, and are called "corn cob lights" because of the rows of yellow LEDs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Corn Lamps: What Are They & Where Can I Use Them? |date=September 1, 2016 |publisher=Shine Retrofits |url=https://www.shineretrofits.com/lighting-center/corn-lamps |access-date=December 30, 2018}}</ref>

==Considerations for use==
===Power sources===
{{Main|LED power sources}}
[[File:LED circuit.svg|thumb|upright|Simple LED circuit with resistor for current limiting]]

The current in an LED or other diodes rises exponentially with the applied voltage (see [[Shockley diode equation]]), so a small change in voltage can cause a large change in current. Current through the LED must be regulated by an external circuit such as a [[constant current]] source to prevent damage. Since most common power supplies are (nearly) constant-voltage sources, LED fixtures must include a power converter, or at least a current-limiting resistor. In some applications, the internal resistance of small batteries is sufficient to keep current within the LED rating.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

===Electrical polarity===
{{Main|Electrical polarity of LEDs}}
Unlike a traditional incandescent lamp, an LED will light only when voltage is applied in the forward direction of the diode. No current flows and no light is emitted if  voltage is applied in the reverse direction. If the reverse voltage exceeds the [[breakdown voltage]], a large current flows and the LED will be damaged. If the reverse current is sufficiently limited to avoid damage, the reverse-conducting LED is a useful [[Hardware random number generator|noise diode]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

===Safety and health===
Certain [[#Ultraviolet and blue LEDs|blue LEDs]] and cool-white LEDs can exceed safe limits of the so-called [[blue-light hazard]] as defined in eye safety specifications such as "ANSI/IESNA RP-27.1–05: Recommended Practice for Photobiological Safety for Lamp and Lamp Systems".<ref name="BlueLEDAhealthHazard">{{cite news | url=http://texyt.com/bright+blue+leds+annoyance+health+risks | title=Blue LEDs: A health hazard? | publisher=texyt.com | date=January 15, 2007 | access-date=September 3, 2007}}</ref> One study showed no evidence of a risk in normal use at domestic illuminance,<ref>[https://www.radioprotection.org/articles/radiopro/abs/2017/04/radiopro170025/radiopro170025.html Some evidences that white LEDs are toxic for human at domestic radiance?].

While LEDs have the advantage over [[fluorescent lamp]]s, in that they do not contain [[mercury (element)|mercury]], they may contain other hazardous metals such as [[lead]] and [[arsenic]].<ref name=Limetal2011>{{Cite journal | last1 = Lim | first1 = S.

In 2016  the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) issued a statement concerning the possible adverse influence of blueish [[street light]]ing on the [[sleep-wake cycle]] of city-dwellers.  Industry critics claim exposure levels are not high enough to have a noticeable effect.<ref>https://www.ledroadwaylighting.com/fr/nouvelles/612-response-to-the-american-medical-association-statement-on-high-intensity-street-lighting.html ''Respnse to the AMA Statement on High Intensity Street Lighting'', retrieved January 17, 2019</ref>

===Advantages===
* '''Efficiency:''' LEDs emit more lumens per watt than incandescent light bulbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ssl/comparing.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505080533/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ssl/comparing.html |archive-date=2009-05-05|title=Solid-State Lighting: Comparing LEDs to Traditional Light Sources|website=eere.energy.gov}}</ref> The efficiency of LED lighting fixtures is not affected by shape and size, unlike fluorescent light bulbs or tubes.
* '''Color:''' LEDs can emit light of an intended color without using any color filters as traditional lighting methods need. This is more efficient and can lower initial costs.
* '''Size:''' LEDs can be very small (smaller than 2&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dialight.com/Assets/Brochures_And_Catalogs/Indication/MDEI5980603.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205040334/http://www.dialight.com/Assets/Brochures_And_Catalogs/Indication/MDEI5980603.pdf |archive-date=2009-02-05|title=Dialight Micro LED SMD LED "598 SERIES" Datasheet|website=Dialight.com}}
</ref>) and are easily attached to printed circuit boards.
* '''Warmup time:''' LEDs light up very quickly. A typical red indicator LED achieves full brightness in under a [[microsecond]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avagotech.com/docs/AV02-1555EN|title=Data Sheet&nbsp;— HLMP-1301, T-1 (3 mm) Diffused LED Lamps |publisher=Avago Technologies |access-date=May 30, 2010}}</ref> LEDs used in communications devices can have even faster response times.
* '''Cycling:''' LEDs are ideal for uses subject to frequent on-off cycling, unlike incandescent and fluorescent lamps that fail faster when cycled often, or [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s (HID lamps) that require a long time before restarting.
* '''Dimming:''' LEDs can very easily be [[Dimmer|dimmed]] either by [[pulse-width modulation]] or lowering the forward current.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Narra |first1=Prathyusha |last2=Zinger |first2=D.S. |journal=Industry Applications Conference, 2004. 39th IAS Annual Meeting. Conference Record of the 2004 IEEE|title=An effective LED dimming approach |year=2004|volume=3 |pages= 1671–1676 |doi=10.1109/IAS.2004.1348695 |isbn=978-0-7803-8486-6 |s2cid=16372401 }}</ref> This pulse-width modulation is why LED lights, particularly headlights on cars,  when viewed on camera or by some people, seem to flash or flicker. This is a type of [[stroboscopic effect]].
* '''Cool light:''' In contrast to most light sources, LEDs radiate very little heat in the form of IR that can cause damage to sensitive objects or fabrics. Wasted energy is dispersed as heat through the base of the LED.
* '''Slow failure:''' LEDs mainly fail by dimming over time, rather than the abrupt failure of incandescent bulbs.<ref name=eere>{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ssl/lifetime.html |title=Lifetime of White LEDs |access-date=2009-04-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410145015/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ssl/lifetime.html |archive-date=April 10, 2009 |df=mdy }}, US Department of Energy</ref>
* '''Lifetime:''' LEDs can have a relatively long useful life. One report estimates 35,000 to 50,000 hours of useful life, though time to complete failure may be shorter or longer.<ref>[http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/ssl/lifetime_white_leds_aug16_r1.pdf Lifetime of White LEDs]. US Department of Energy. (PDF) . Retrieved on March 16, 2012.</ref> Fluorescent tubes typically are rated at about 10,000 to 25,000 hours, depending partly on the conditions of use, and incandescent light bulbs at 1,000 to 2,000 hours. Several [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] demonstrations have shown that reduced maintenance costs from this extended lifetime, rather than energy savings, is the primary factor in determining the payback period for an LED product.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://energy.ltgovernors.com/in-depth-advantages-of-led-lighting.html|title=In depth: Advantages of LED Lighting|website=energy.ltgovernors.com}}</ref>
* '''Shock resistance:''' LEDs, being solid-state components, are difficult to damage with external shock, unlike fluorescent and incandescent bulbs, which are fragile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.larsonelectronics.com/a-5-led-light-bars-for-off-road-illumination.aspx|title=LED Light Bars For Off Road Illumination|website=Larson Electronics}}</ref>
* '''Focus:''' The solid package of the LED can be designed to [[focus (optics)|focus]] its light. Incandescent and fluorescent sources often require an external reflector to collect light and direct it in a usable manner. For larger LED packages [[total internal reflection]] (TIR) lenses are often used to the same effect. However, when large quantities of light are needed many light sources are usually deployed, which are difficult to focus or [[collimate]] towards the same target.

===Disadvantages===
* '''Temperature dependence:''' LED performance largely depends on the ambient temperature of the operating environment&nbsp;– or thermal management properties. Overdriving an LED in high ambient temperatures may result in overheating the LED package, eventually leading to device failure. An adequate [[heat sink]] is needed to maintain long life. This is especially important in automotive, medical, and military uses where devices must operate over a wide range of temperatures, and require low failure rates. 
* '''Voltage sensitivity:''' LEDs must be supplied with a voltage above their [[P–n junction#Forward bias|threshold voltage]] and a current below their rating. Current and lifetime change greatly with a small change in applied voltage. They thus require a current-regulated supply (usually just a series resistor for indicator LEDs).<ref>[http://www.ledmuseum.org/ The Led Museum]. The Led Museum. Retrieved on March 16, 2012.</ref>
* '''Color rendition:''' Most cool-[[#Other white LEDs|white LEDs]] have spectra that differ significantly from a [[black body]] radiator like the sun or an incandescent light. The spike at 460&nbsp;nm and dip at 500&nbsp;nm can make the color of objects [[color vision|appear differently]] under cool-white LED illumination than sunlight or incandescent sources, due to [[metamerism (color)|metamerism]],<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.jimworthey.com/jimtalk2006feb.html|title = How White Light Works|author = Worthey, James A. |website = LRO Lighting Research Symposium, Light and Color|access-date = October 6, 2007}}</ref> red surfaces being rendered particularly poorly by typical phosphor-based cool-white LEDs. The same is true with green surfaces. The quality of color rendition of an LED is measured by the [[Color rendering index|Color Rendering Index (CRI)]]. 
* '''Area light source:''' Single LEDs do not approximate a [[point source]] of light giving a spherical light distribution, but rather a [[Lambert's cosine law|lambertian]] distribution. So, LEDs are difficult to apply to uses needing a spherical light field; however, different fields of light can be manipulated by the application of different optics or "lenses". LEDs cannot provide divergence below a few degrees.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Hecht, E. |title=Optics|url=https://archive.org/details/optics00ehec |url-access=limited |edition=4|page=[https://archive.org/details/optics00ehec/page/n596 591]|publisher=Addison Wesley|year= 2002|isbn=978-0-19-510818-7}}</ref>
* '''[[Light pollution]]:''' Because [[#White light|white LEDs]] emit more short wavelength light than sources such as high-pressure [[sodium vapor lamp]]s, the increased blue and green sensitivity of [[scotopic vision]] means that white LEDs used in outdoor lighting cause substantially more [[sky glow]].<ref name="IDA">{{Cite book|title=Visibility, Environmental, and Astronomical Issues Associated with Blue-Rich White Outdoor Lighting |publisher=International Dark-Sky Association |date=May 4, 2010 |url=http://www.darksky.org/assets/documents/Reports/IDA-Blue-Rich-Light-White-Paper.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116003035/http://darksky.org/assets/documents/Reports/IDA-Blue-Rich-Light-White-Paper.pdf |archive-date=January 16, 2013 }}</ref>
* '''[[LED droop|Efficiency droop]]:''' The efficiency of LEDs decreases as the [[electric current]] increases. Heating also increases with higher currents, which compromises LED lifetime. These effects put practical limits on the current through an LED in high power applications.<ref name=stevenson>Stevenson, Richard (August 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090805082614/http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/optoelectronics/the-leds-dark-secret The LED’s Dark Secret: Solid-state lighting won't supplant the lightbulb until it can overcome the mysterious malady known as droop].

* '''Use in winter conditions:''' Since they do not give off much heat in comparison to incandescent lights, LED lights used for traffic control can have snow obscuring them, leading to accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/ConsumerNews/led-traffic-lights-unusual-potentially-deadly-winter-problem/story?id=9506449|title=Stoplights' Potentially Deadly Winter Problem|date=January 8, 2010|publisher=ABC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cars.com/articles/2009/12/led-traffic-lights-cant-melt-snow-ice/|title=LED Traffic Lights Can't Melt Snow, Ice}}</ref>
* '''Thermal runaway:''' Parallel strings of LEDs will not share current evenly due to the manufacturing tolerances in their forward voltage.  Running two or more strings from a single current source may result in LED failure as the devices warm up. If forward voltage binning is not possible, a circuit is required to ensure even distribution of current between parallel strands.<ref>https://www.ledsmagazine.com/articles/print/volume-6/issue-2/features/led-design-forum-avoiding-thermal-runaway-when-driving-multiple-led-strings-magazine.html ''Avoiding therma runaway when driving multiple LED strings'', retrieved January 17, 2019</ref>

[[File:LED DaytimeRunningLights.jpg|thumb|[[Daytime running light]] LEDs of an automobile]]

LED uses fall into four major categories:

* Visual signals where light goes more or less directly from the source to the human eye, to convey a message or meaning
* [[Lighting|Illumination]] where light is reflected from objects to give visual response of these objects
* Measuring and interacting with processes involving no human vision<ref>[[European Photonics Industry Consortium]] (EPIC). This includes use in data communications over [[Optical fiber|fiber optics]] as well as "broadcast" data or signaling.</ref>

===Indicators and signs===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2020}}
The [[energy conservation|low energy consumption]], low maintenance and small size of LEDs has led to uses as status indicators and displays on a variety of equipment and installations. Large-area [[LED display]]s are used as stadium displays, dynamic decorative displays, and [[dynamic message sign]]s on freeways. Thin, lightweight message displays are used at airports and railway stations, and as [[Destination sign|destination displays]] for trains, buses, trams, and ferries.

[[File:Red and green traffic signals, Stamford Road, Singapore - 20111210.jpg|thumb|upright|Red and green LED traffic signals]]

One-color light is well suited for [[traffic light]]s and signals, [[exit sign]]s, [[emergency vehicle lighting]], ships' navigation lights, and [[Christmas lighting technology#LEDs|LED-based Christmas lights]]

Because of their long life, fast switching times, and visibility in broad daylight due to their high output and focus, LEDs have been used in automotive brake lights and turn signals. The use in brakes improves safety, due to a great reduction in the time needed to light fully, or faster rise time, about 0.1 second faster{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} than an incandescent bulb. This gives drivers behind more time to react. In a dual intensity circuit (rear markers and brakes) if the LEDs are not pulsed at a fast enough frequency, they can create a [[flicker fusion threshold#Visual phenomena|phantom array]], where ghost images of the LED appear if the eyes quickly scan across the array. White LED headlamps are beginning to appear. Using LEDs has styling advantages because LEDs can form much thinner lights than incandescent lamps with [[parabolic reflector]]s.

Due to the relative cheapness of low output LEDs, they are also used in many temporary uses such as [[glowstick]]s, [[throwies]], and the photonic [[textile]] [[Lumalive]]. Artists have also used LEDs for [[LED art]].

===Lighting===
{{main|LED lamp}}
With the development of high-efficiency and high-power LEDs, it has become possible to use LEDs in lighting and illumination. To encourage the shift to [[LED lamp]]s and other high-efficiency lighting, in 2008 the [[US Department of Energy]] created the [[L Prize]] competition. The [[Philips]] Lighting North America LED bulb won the first competition on August 3, 2011, after successfully completing 18 months of intensive field, lab, and product testing.<ref>[http://www.lightingprize.org/ "L-Prize U.S. Department of Energy"], L-Prize Website, August 3, 2011</ref>

Efficient lighting is needed for [[sustainable architecture]]. As of 2011, some LED  bulbs provide up to 150&nbsp;lm/W and even inexpensive low-end models typically exceed 50&nbsp;lm/W, so that a 6-watt LED could achieve the same results as a standard 40-watt incandescent bulb. The lower heat output of LEDs also reduces demand on [[air conditioning]] systems. Worldwide, LEDs are rapidly adopted to displace less effective sources such as [[incandescent light bulb|incandescent lamps]] and [[compact fluorescent lamp|CFLs]] and reduce electrical energy consumption and its associated emissions. Solar powered LEDs are used as [[street light]]s and in [[Architectural lighting design|architectural lighting]].

The mechanical robustness and long lifetime are used in [[automotive lighting]] on cars, motorcycles, and [[Bicycle lighting#LEDs|bicycle lights]]. [[LED street light]]s are employed on poles and in parking garages. In 2007, the Italian village of [[Torraca]] was the first place to convert its street lighting to LEDs.<ref>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=led-there-be-light LED There Be Light], Scientific American, March 18, 2009</ref>

Cabin lighting on recent [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing]] jetliners uses LED lighting.  LEDs are also being used  in airport and heliport lighting. LED airport fixtures currently include medium-intensity runway lights, runway centerline lights, taxiway centerline and edge lights, guidance signs, and obstruction lighting.

LEDs are also used as a light source for [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] projectors, and to [[backlight]] [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] televisions (referred to as [[LED-backlit LCD display|LED TVs]]) and [[laptop]] displays. RGB LEDs raise the color gamut by as much as 45%. Screens for TV and computer displays can be made thinner using LEDs for backlighting.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/business/yourmoney/24novel.html|newspaper=New York Times|title=In Pursuit of Perfect TV Color, With L.E.D.'s and Lasers|date=June 24, 2007|first=Anne|last=Eisenberg|access-date=April 4, 2010}}</ref>

LEDs are small, durable and need little power, so they are used in handheld devices such as [[flashlight]]s. LED [[strobe light]]s or [[camera flash]]es operate at a safe, low voltage, instead of the 250+ volts commonly found in [[xenon]] flashlamp-based lighting. This is especially useful in cameras on [[mobile phone]]s, where space is at a premium and bulky voltage-raising circuitry is undesirable.

LEDs are used for infrared illumination in [[night vision]] uses including [[security camera]]s. A ring of LEDs around a [[video camera]], aimed forward into a [[retroreflective]] [[Projection screen|background]], allows [[chroma keying]] in [[video production]]s.

LEDs are used in [[Mining|mining operations]], as cap lamps to provide light for miners. Research has been done to improve LEDs for mining, to reduce glare and to increase illumination, reducing risk of injury to the miners.<ref>{{Cite journal | url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-192/ | title = CDC – NIOSH Publications and Products – Impact: NIOSH Light-Emitting Diode (LED) Cap Lamp Improves Illumination and Decreases Injury Risk for Underground Miners | publisher = cdc.gov | access-date=May 3, 2013| doi = 10.26616/NIOSHPUB2011192 | year = 2011 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Data communication and other signalling===
{{See also|Li-Fi|fibre optics|Visible light communication}}
Light can be used to transmit data and analog signals. For example, lighting white LEDs can be used in systems assisting people to navigate in closed spaces while searching necessary rooms or objects.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/11192/chastotnye_harakteristiki_sovremennyh_svetodiodnyh_lyuminofornyh_materialov.htm |title=Frequency characteristics of modern LED phosphor materials |author1=Fudin, M.

[[Assistive listening device]]s in many theaters and similar spaces use arrays of infrared LEDs to send sound to listeners' receivers. Light-emitting diodes (as well as semiconductor lasers) are used to send data over many types of [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] cable, from digital audio over [[TOSLINK]] cables to the very high bandwidth fiber links that form the Internet backbone. For some time, computers were commonly equipped with [[IrDA]] interfaces, which allowed them to send and receive data to nearby machines via infrared.

Because LEDs can [[frequency|cycle on and off]] millions of times per second, very high data bandwidth can be achieved.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Hank |last=Green |url=http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/2194/74/ |title=Transmitting Data Through LED Light Bulbs |publisher=EcoGeek |date=October 9, 2008 |access-date=February 15, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212050729/http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/2194/74/ |archive-date=December 12, 2008 }}</ref> For that reason, [[Visible light communication|Visible Light Communication]] (VLC) has been proposed as an alternative to the increasingly competitive radio bandwidth.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last1=Dimitrov|first1=Svilen|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/principles-of-led-light-communications/0528063BAA6863F6B6D61F6FF69F37CB|title=Principles of LED Light Communications: Towards Networked Li-Fi|last2=Haas|first2=Harald|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-04942-0|location=Cambridge|doi=10.1017/cbo9781107278929}}</ref> By operating in the visible part of the electromagnectic spectrum, data can be transmitted without occupying the frequencies of radio communications.

The main characteristic of VLC, lies on the incapacity of light to surpass physical opaque barriers. This characteristic can be considered a weak point of VLC, due to the susceptibility of interference from physical objects, but is also one of its many strenghts: unlike radio waves, light waves are confined in the encolsed spaces they are transmitted, which enforces a physical safety barrier that requires a receptor of that signal to have physical access to the place where the transmission is occurring.<ref name=":4" />

A promising applications of VLC lies on the [[Indoor positioning system|Indoor Positioning System]] (IPS), an analogous to the GPS built to operate in enclosed spaces where the satellite transmissions that allow the GPS operation are hard to reach. For instance, commercial buildings, shopping malls, parking garages, as well as subways and tunnel systems are all possible applications for VLC-based indoor positioning systems. Additionally, once the VLC lamps are able to perform lighting at the same time as data transmission, it can simply occupy the installation of traditional single-function lamps.

Other applications for VLC involve communication between appliances of a smart home or office. With increasing [[Internet of things|IoT]]-capable devices, connectivity through traditional radio waves might be subjected to interference.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Cisco Annual Internet Report - Cisco Annual Internet Report (2018–2023) White Paper|url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/white-paper-c11-741490.html|access-date=2020-10-21|website=Cisco|language=en}}</ref> However, light bulbs with VLC capabilities would be able to transmit data and commands for such devices.

=== Machine vision systems ===
{{main|Machine vision}}
[[Machine vision]] systems often require bright and homogeneous illumination, so features of interest are easier to process. LEDs are often used.

[[Barcode scanner]]s are the most common example of machine vision applications, and many of those scanners use red LEDs instead of lasers. Optical computer mice use LEDs as a light source for the miniature camera within the mouse.

LEDs are useful for machine vision  because they provide a compact, reliable source of light.  LED lamps can be turned on and off to suit the needs of the vision system, and the shape of the beam produced can be tailored to match the system's requirements.

=== Biological detection ===
The discovery of radiative recombination in Aluminum Gallium Nitride (AlGaN) alloys by [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] (ARL) led to the conceptualization of UV light emitting diodes (LEDs) to be incorporated in light induced [[fluorescence]] sensors used for biological agent detection.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Sampath|first1=A.

The program capitalized on Semiconductor UV Optical Sources (SUVOS) developed by the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]].<ref name=":2" />

UV induced fluorescence is one of the most robust techniques used for rapid real time detection of biological aerosols.<ref name=":2" /> The first UV sensors were lasers lacking in-field-use practicality. In order to address this, [[DARPA]] incorporated SUVOS technology to create a low cost, small, lightweight, low power device. The TAC-BIO detector's response time was one minute from when it sensed a biological agent. It was also demonstrated that the detector could be operated unattended indoors and outdoors for weeks at a time.<ref name=":2" />

Aerosolized biological particles will fluoresce and scatter light under a UV light beam. Observed fluorescence is dependent on the applied wavelength and the biochemical fluorophores within the biological agent. UV induced fluorescence offers a rapid, accurate, efficient and logistically practical way for biological agent detection. This is because the use of UV fluorescence is reagent less, or a process that does not require an added chemical to produce a reaction, with no consumables, or produces no chemical byproducts.<ref name=":2" />

Additionally, TAC-BIO can reliably discriminate between threat and non-threat aerosols. It was claimed to be sensitive enough to detect low concentrations, but not so sensitive that it would cause false positives. The particle counting algorithm used in the device converted raw data into information by counting the photon pulses per unit of time from the fluorescence and scattering detectors, and comparing the value to a set threshold.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Poldmae|first1=Aime|last2=Cabalo|first2=Jerry|last3=De Lucia|first3=Marla|last4=Narayanan|first4=Fiona|last5=Strauch III|first5=Lester|last6=Sickenberger|first6=David|date=2006-09-28|title=Biological aerosol detection with the tactical biological (TAC-BIO) detector|journal=Optically Based Biological and Chemical Detection for Defence III|volume=6398|pages=63980E|publisher=SPIE|doi=10.1117/12.687944|s2cid=136864366|editor1-last=Carrano|editor1-first=John C|editor2-last=Zukauskas|editor2-first=Arturas}}</ref>

The original TAC-BIO was introduced in 2010, while the second generation TAC-BIO GEN II, was designed in 2015 to be more cost efficient as plastic parts were used. Its small, light-weight design allows it to be mounted to vehicles, robots, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The second generation device could also be utilized as an environmental detector to monitor air quality in hospitals, airplanes, or even in households to detect fungus and mold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/141363/army_advances_bio_threat_detector|title=Army advances bio-threat detector|website=www.army.mil|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kesavan|first1=Jana|last2=Kilper|first2=Gary|last3=Williamson|first3=Mike|last4=Alstadt|first4=Valerie|last5=Dimmock|first5=Anne|last6=Bascom|first6=Rebecca|date=2019-02-01|title=Laboratory validation and initial field testing of an unobtrusive bioaerosol detector for health care settings|url=https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/laboratory-validation-and-initial-field-testing-of-an-unobtrusive|journal=Aerosol and Air Quality Research|volume=19|issue=2|pages=331–344|doi=10.4209/aaqr.2017.10.0371|issn=1680-8584|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The light from LEDs can be modulated very quickly so they are used extensively in [[optical fiber]] and [[free space optics]] communications. This includes [[remote control]]s, such as for television sets, where infrared LEDs are often used. [[Opto-isolator]]s use an LED combined with a [[photodiode]] or [[phototransistor]] to provide a signal path with electrical isolation between two circuits. This is especially useful in medical equipment where the signals from a low-voltage [[sensor]] circuit (usually battery-powered) in contact with a living organism must be electrically isolated from any possible electrical failure in a recording or monitoring device operating at potentially dangerous voltages. An optoisolator also lets information be transferred between circuits that don't share a common ground potential.

Many sensor systems rely on light as the signal source. LEDs are often ideal as a light source due to the requirements of the sensors.  The Nintendo [[Wii]]'s sensor bar uses infrared LEDs. [[Pulse oximeter]]s use them for measuring [[oxygen saturation]]. Some flatbed scanners use arrays of RGB LEDs rather than the typical [[cold-cathode fluorescent lamp]] as the light source. Having independent control of three illuminated colors allows the scanner to calibrate itself for more accurate color balance, and there is no need for warm-up. Further, its sensors only need be monochromatic, since at any one time the page being scanned is only lit by one color of light.

Since LEDs can also be used as photodiodes, they can be used for both photo emission and detection. This could be used, for example, in a [[touchscreen]] that registers reflected light from a finger or [[stylus]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Dietz, P. H. |author2=Yerazunis, W. S. |author3=Leigh, D.

Deep UV LEDs, with a spectra range 247&nbsp;nm to 386&nbsp;nm, have other applications, such as water/air purification, surface disinfection, epoxy curing, free-space nonline-of-sight communication, high performance liquid chromatography, UV curing and printing, phototherapy, medical/ analytical instrumentation, and DNA absorption.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gaska|first1=R.|last2=Shur|first2=M.

LEDs have also been used as a medium-quality [[voltage reference]] in electronic circuits. The forward voltage drop (about 1.7&nbsp;V for a red LED or 1.2V for an infrared) can be used instead of a [[Zener diode]] in low-voltage regulators. Red LEDs have the flattest I/V curve above the knee. Nitride-based LEDs have a fairly steep I/V curve and are useless for this purpose. Although LED forward voltage is far more current-dependent than a Zener diode, Zener diodes with breakdown voltages below 3&nbsp;V are not widely available.

The progressive miniaturization of low-voltage lighting technology, such as LEDs and OLEDs, suitable to incorporate into low-thickness materials has fostered experimentation in combining light sources and wall covering surfaces for interior walls in the form of [[LED wallpaper]].

== Research and development ==
=== Key challenges ===
LEDs require optimized efficiency to hinge on ongoing improvements such as phosphor materials and [[quantum dot]]s.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/ssl/led-rd-challenges|title=LED R&D Challenges|website=Energy.gov|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref>

The process of down-conversion (the method by which materials convert more-energetic photons to different, less energetic colors) also needs improvement. For example, the red phosphors that are used today are thermally sensitive and need to be improved in that aspect so that they do not color shift and experience efficiency drop-off with temperature. Red phosphors could also benefit from a narrower spectral width to emit more lumens and becoming more efficient at converting photons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/ssl/downloads/july-2015-postings|title=JULY 2015 POSTINGS|website=Energy.gov|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref>

In addition, work remains to be done in the realms of current efficiency droop, color shift, system reliability, light distribution, dimming, thermal management, and power supply performance.<ref name=":0" />

=== Potential technology ===
==== Perovskite LEDs (PLEDs) ====
A new family of LEDs are based on the semiconductors called [[Perovskite (structure)|perovskites]]. In 2018, less than four years after their discovery, the ability of perovskite LEDs (PLEDs) to produce light from electrons already rivaled those of the best performing [[OLED]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Di|first1=Dawei|last2=Romanov|first2=Alexander S.|last3=Yang|first3=Le|last4=Richter|first4=Johannes M.|last5=Rivett|first5=Jasmine P.

Their efficiency is superior by eliminating non-radiative losses, in other words, elimination of [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]] pathways that do not produce photons; or by solving outcoupling problem (prevalent for thin-film LEDs) or balancing charge carrier injection to increase the [[External quantum efficiency|EQE]] (external quantum efficiency). The most up-to-date PLED devices have broken the performance barrier by shooting the EQE above 20%.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Armin|first1=Ardalan|last2=Meredith|first2=Paul|date=October 2018|title=LED technology breaks performance barrier|journal=Nature|volume=562|issue=7726|pages=197–198|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-06923-y|pmid=30305755|bibcode=2018Natur.562..197M|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In 2018, Cao et al. and Lin et al. independently published two papers on developing perovskite LEDs with EQE greater than 20%, which made these two papers a mile-stone in PLED development. Their device have similar planar structure, i.e. the active layer (perovskite) is sandwiched between two electrodes. To achieve a high EQE, they not only reduced non-radiative recombination, but also utilized their own, subtly different methods to improve the EQE.<ref name=":3" />

In Cao and his colleagues' work, they targeted to solve the outcoupling problem, which is that the optical physics of thin-film LEDs causes the majority of light generated by the semiconductor to be trapped in the device.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cho|first1=Sang-Hwan|last2=Song|first2=Young-Woo|last3=Lee|first3=Joon-gu|last4=Kim|first4=Yoon-Chang|last5=Lee|first5=Jong Hyuk|last6=Ha|first6=Jaeheung|last7=Oh|first7=Jong-Suk|last8=Lee|first8=So Young|last9=Lee|first9=Sun Young|last10=Hwang|first10=Kyu Hwan|last11=Zang|first11=Dong-Sik|date=2008-08-18|title=Weak-microcavity organic light-emitting diodes with improved light out-coupling|journal=Optics Express|language=EN|volume=16|issue=17|pages=12632–12639|doi=10.1364/OE.16.012632|pmid=18711500|issn=1094-4087|bibcode=2008OExpr..1612632C}}</ref> To achieve this goal, they demonstrated that solution-processed perovskites can spontaneously form submicrometre-scale crystal platelets, which can efficiently extract light from the device. These perovskites are formed via the introduction of [[amino acid]] additives into the perovskite [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] solutions. In addition, their method is able to passivate perovskite surface [[Crystallographic defects in diamond|defects]] and reduce nonradiative recombination. Therefore, by improving the light outcoupling and reducing nonradiative losses, Cao and his colleagues successfully achieved PLED with EQE up to 20.7%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cao|first1=Yu|last2=Wang|first2=Nana|last3=Tian|first3=He|last4=Guo|first4=Jingshu|last5=Wei|first5=Yingqiang|last6=Chen|first6=Hong|last7=Miao|first7=Yanfeng|last8=Zou|first8=Wei|last9=Pan|first9=Kang|last10=He|first10=Yarong|last11=Cao|first11=Hui|date=October 2018|title=Perovskite light-emitting diodes based on spontaneously formed submicrometre-scale structures|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=562|issue=7726|pages=249–253|doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0576-2|pmid=30305742|issn=1476-4687|bibcode=2018Natur.562..249C|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In Lin and his colleague's work, however, they used a different approach to generate high EQE. Instead of modifying the microstructure of perovskite layer, they chose to adopt a new strategy for managing the compositional distribution in the device——an approach that simultaneously provides high [[luminescence]] and balanced charge injection. In other words, they still used flat emissive layer, but tried to optimize the balance of electrons and holes injected into the perovskite, so as to make the most efficient use of the charge carriers. Moreover, in the perovskite layer, the crystals are perfectly enclosed by MABr additive (where MA is CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>). The MABr shell passivates the nonradiative defects that would otherwise be present perovskite crystals, resulting in reduction of the nonradiative recombination. Therefore, by balancing charge injection and decreasing nonradiative losses, Lin and his colleagues developed PLED with EQE up to 20.3%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=Kebin|last2=Xing|first2=Jun|last3=Quan|first3=Li Na|last4=de Arquer|first4=F.

==== Two-way LEDs ====
Devices called "nanorods" are a form of LEDs that can also detect and absorb light. They consist of a [[quantum dot]] directly contacting two semiconductor materials (instead of just one as in a traditional LED). One semiconductor allows movement of positive charge and one allows movement of negative charge. They can emit light, sense light, and collect energy. The nanorod gathers electrons while the quantum dot shell gathers positive charges so the dot emits light. When the voltage is switched the opposite process occurs and the dot absorbs light. By 2017 the only color developed was red.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/watch-phones-future-could-detect-your-gestures-without-touch-thanks-two-way-leds|title=Watch: Phones of the future could detect your gestures without touch, thanks to two-way LEDs|last=Hiolski|first=Emma|date=2017-02-09|website=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref>
