==Early life==
Philippe was born on 15 April 1960 during the reign of his uncle, King [[Baudouin of Belgium]]. His father, [[Albert II of Belgium|Prince Albert]], [[Prince of Liège]] (later King Albert II) was the second son of King [[Leopold III of Belgium]] and a younger brother of Baudouin. His mother, [[Queen Paola of Belgium|Paola, Princess of Liège]] (later Queen Paola), is a daughter of [[Italy|Italian]] aristocrat [[Fulco Ruffo di Calabria|Fulco VIII, Prince Ruffo di Calabria, 6th Duke of Guardia Lombarda]]. His mother descends from the French [[House of La Fayette]], and the king is a descendant of [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette]] and [[Adrienne de La Fayette|Marie Adrienne Françoise de Noailles]].

He was born at the [[Belvédère Castle]] in [[Laeken]] north of [[Brussels]]. He was [[baptism|baptised]] one month later at the church of [[Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg]] in Brussels on 17 May,<ref>{{cite web |language=French |author=J.M. |title=Le baptême en l'église royale... |url=http://www.dhnet.be/archive/le-bapteme-en-l-eglise-royale-51b86e81e4b0de6db9a5324a |date=8 May 2001 |website=dh.be |access-date=11 December 2015}}</ref> and named Philippe after his great-great-grandfather [[Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders]].
