== History ==

===20th century===
[[File:Fujifilm old logo.svg|thumb|Former Fujifilm logo. The "Fuji" logo on the left was introduced in 1980, while the "Fujifilm" wordmark on the right was introduced in 1992. Both were replaced with the current logo in 2006.|261x261px]]
Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. was established in 1934 as a subsidiary of [[Daicel]] with the aim of producing [[photographic film]]s. Over the following 10 years, the company produced photographic films, motion-picture films and X-ray films. In the 1940s, Fuji Photo entered the optical glasses, lenses and equipment markets. After the Second World War, Fuji Photo diversified, penetrating the medical (X-ray diagnosis), printing, electronic imaging and magnetic materials fields. In 1962, Fuji Photo and UK-based [[Rank Xerox]] Limited (now Xerox Limited) launched [[Fuji Xerox]] Co., Ltd. through a joint venture.

From the mid-1950s, Fuji Photo accelerated the establishment of overseas sales bases. In the 1980s, Fuji Photo expanded its production and other bases overseas, stepping up the pace of its business globalization. Meanwhile, Fuji Photo developed digital technologies for its photo-related, medical and printing businesses. As a result, it invented [[Digital radiography|computed radiography]] (CR), which solved a number of issues of traditional radiography, resulting a decrease of radiation exposure to both technician and patient. Fujifilm's systems were marketed and sold under the [[FCR (radiography)|FCR]] brand.<ref name="Fujifilm-CR" />

Like its rival [[Eastman Kodak]] which dominated in the US, Fuji Photo enjoyed a longtime near-monopoly on camera film in Japan. By becoming one of the title sponsors of the [[1984 Los Angeles Olympics]] (an opportunity that Kodak passed on), offering cheaper camera film, and establishing a film factory in the US, Fuji gained considerable market share there, while Kodak had little success in penetrating Japan. In May 1995, Kodak filed a petition with the US Commerce Department under section 301 of the Commerce Act arguing that its poor performance in the Japanese market was a direct result of unfair practices adopted by Fuji. The complaint was lodged by the US with the World Trade Organization. On January 30, 1998, the WTO announced a "sweeping rejection of Kodak's complaints" about the film market in Japan.<ref name="economist1">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21542796 |title=Technological change: The last Kodak moment? |publisher=The Economist |date=2012-01-14 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Business%20strategy1/The%20Kodak%20-%20Fuji%20Rivalry.htm |title=The Kodak - Fuji Rivalry &#124;Business Strategy Case Studies&#124;Business Strategy Articles |publisher=Icmrindia.org |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}</ref>

===21st century===
The new millennium witnessed the rapid spread of digital technology, and demand for photographic films plunged in line with the growing popularity of digital cameras. In response, Fuji Photo implemented management reforms aimed at drastic transformation of its business structures. Even as early as the 1980s, the company had foreseen the switch from film to digital, so "it developed a three-pronged strategy: to squeeze as much money out of the film business as possible, to prepare for the switch to digital and to develop new business lines." While both film manufacturers recognized this fundamental change, Fuji Photo adapted to this shift much more successfully<ref name="economist1"/> than Eastman Kodak (which filed for bankruptcy in January 2012). Fuji Photo's diversification efforts also succeeded while Kodak's had failed; furthermore Kodak built up a large but barely profitable digital camera business that was undone quickly by smartphone cameras.<ref name="economist1"/>

On September 19, 2006, Fujifilm announced plans to establish a [[holding company]], Fujifilm Holdings Corp. Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox would become subsidiaries of the holding company. A representative of the company reconfirmed its commitment to film, which accounts for 3% of sales.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/news/2006/09/20/news/fuji-photo-to-diversify-shift-to-holding-company-system/#.VcEILMCqp2Y Fuji Photo to diversify, shift to holding company system | The Japan Times Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On January 31, 2018, Fujifilm announced that it would acquire a 50.1% controlling stake in Xerox for US$6.1 billion, which will be amalgamated into its existing Fuji Xerox business.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/01/fujifilm-acquires-xerox-for-6-1-billion/|title=Fujifilm acquires Xerox for $6.1 billion|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/300098681/a-giant-is-born-fujifilm-deal-allows-xerox-to-make-inroads-into-asia-pacific-print-market-bolster-next-gen-rd-efforts.htm|title=A Giant Is Born: Fujifilm Deal Allows Xerox To Make Inroads Into Asia-Pacific Print Market, Bolster Next-Gen R&D Efforts|last=Shirkey|first=Alec|date=2018-01-31|work=CRN|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/300098661/fujifilm-buys-controlling-stake-in-xerox-creating-an-18-billion-printer-industry-behemoth.htm|title=Fujifilm Buys Controlling Stake In Xerox, Creating An $18 Billion Printer Industry Behemoth|last=Shirkey|first=Alec|date=2018-01-31|work=CRN|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en}}</ref> The deal was subsequently dropped after intervention by activist investors [[Carl Icahn]] and [[Darwin Deason]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/05/14/xerox-drops-fujifilm-deal-in-settlement-with-carl-icahn.html|title=Xerox drops Fujifilm deal in settlement with Carl Icahn|website=CNBC|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref>  In late 2019, Fujifilm announced its acquisition of Xerox's 25% stake in the 57-year-old joint venture, Fuji Xerox.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2019-11-05|title=Xerox exits Fujifilm venture with $2.3 billion stake sale to Japan partner|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-xerox-fujifilm-idUSKBN1XF0NB|access-date=2020-07-17}}</ref>

In December 2019, Fujifilm acquired [[Hitachi]]'s diagnostic imaging business for US$1.63 billion.<ref name="Hitachi-acquisition" />

Amid the [[COVID-19 pandemic|2020 COVID-19 pandemic]], one of Fujifilm Toyama Chemical drugs, i.e. [[favipiravir]], an antiviral commercially named Avigan, is being considered as a possible cure to the virus,<ref>{{cite news|last=Matsuoka|first=Katsumori|date=April 13, 2020|title=Fujifilm tests favipiravir as COVID-19 treatment|work=C&EN|url=https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-development/Fujifilm-tests-favipiravir-COVID-19/98/web/2020/04|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Avigan-licensing" /> after having been approved by China, Russia, and Indonesia authorities by June 2020.

In June 2020, Fujifilm announced a US$928 million investment to a [[Denmark]]-based biologics production facility, which it acquired from [[Biogen]] a year earlier for around US$890 million, to double the manufacturing capacity.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-06-10|title=Fujifilm commits $928m to expand biologics facility in Denmark|url=https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/fujifilm-denmark-facility-investment/|access-date=2020-07-17|website=Pharmaceutical Technology|language=en-GB}}</ref> A [[Tape drive|tape cartridge]] using [[strontium]] [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] that could store up to 400[[Terabyte|TB]] was showcased by Fujifilm in the late same month.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mellor|first=Chris|date=2020-06-29|title=Fujifilm points to 400TB tape cartridge on the horizon|url=https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/06/29/fujifilm-400tb-magnetic-tape-cartridge-future/|access-date=2020-07-17|website=Blocks and Files|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Subsidiaries==
[[Fuji Xerox]] was a joint venture between Fujifilm and [[Xerox]] Corporation of North America. After the dissolution of their partnership in 2019, Fujifilm made it a wholly owned subsidiary.
