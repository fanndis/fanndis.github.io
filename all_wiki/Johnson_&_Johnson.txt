== Headquarters and the New Brunswick gentrification ==
The company has historically been located on the [[Delaware and Raritan Canal]] in New Brunswick. The company considered moving its headquarters out of New Brunswick in the 1960s but decided to stay in the town after city officials promised to revitalize downtown New Brunswick by demolishing old buildings and constructing new ones. While New Brunswick lost many historic structures, including the early home of Rutgers University, and most of its historic commercial waterfront to the redevelopment effort, the gentrification did attract people back to New Brunswick. Johnson & Johnson hired [[Henry N. Cobb]] from [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]] to design its new headquarters. [[Johnson and Johnson Plaza]], in a park across the [[Northeast Corridor|railroad tracks]] from the older portion of the headquarters, is one of [[List of tallest buildings in New Brunswick|tallest buildings in New Brunswick]].

The stretch of Delaware and Raritan canal by the company's headquarters was replaced by a stretch of [[New Jersey Route 18|Route 18]] in the late 1970s,<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=F00714FC345D167493CBA9178CD85F438785F9 2 Long-Disputed Projects to Begin], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 9, 1977</ref> after a lengthy dispute.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=FA0914FC355F167493C4A8178FD85F438785F9 Old Raritan Canal Lock Is Focus of a Classic Dispute], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 16, 1977.</ref> In 2002, the company released its plan of setting up [[Asia-Pacific]] information technology headquarters in New South Wales within five years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20020314023 |title=JOHNSON & JOHNSON ASIA-PACIFIC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HEADQUARTERS |date=March 14, 2002 |access-date=July 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530111717/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20020314023 |archive-date=May 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

== Products ==
The company's business is divided into three major segments, Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, and Consumer Products. In 2015, these segments contributed 44.9%, 35.9%, and 19.2%, respectively, of the company's total revenues.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/JNJ/1709744668x0x881109/474857DD-8E67-43B1-BB38-0A9712D93545/2015_annual_report_.pdf |work=files.shareholder.com |title=Downloads }}</ref>

=== Pharmaceuticals ===
The company's major primary franchises in the Pharmaceutical segment include Immunology, Neuroscience, Infectious Disease, and Oncology. In 2013, Remicade (infliximab), and Simponi (golimumab) accounted for 29% of Johnson and Johnson's pharmaceutical revenues, and 11.3% of the company's total revenues. A third immunology product, Stelara ([[ustekinumab]]), targets [[interleukin-12]] and [[interleukin-23]] and is used for the treatment of [[psoriasis]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/125261s114lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov }}</ref>

The company's CNS products include the ADHD drug Concerta ([[methylphenidate]] extended release), and the long-acting injectable antipsychotics Invega Sustenna ([[paliperidone palmitate]]) and Risperdal Consta ([[risperidone]]). Invega Sustenna and Risperdal Consta were the first widely utilized long-acting depot injections for the treatment of schizophrenia. Designed to address the issue of poor patient compliance with oral therapy, they are administered by intramuscular injection at intervals of 2 weeks and one month, respectively. Only minimal improvements in outcomes relative to the oral versions of these drugs were observed in the clinical trial setting, but some evidence suggests that the advantages of long-acting injections in clinical practice may be greater than is readily demonstrated in the environment of a clinical trial.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kaplan G, Casoy J, Zummo J |title=Impact of long-acting injectable antipsychotics on medication adherence and clinical, functional, and economic outcomes of schizophrenia |journal=Patient Prefer Adherence |volume=7 |pages=1171–80 |year=2013 |pmid=24265549 |pmc=3833623 |doi=10.2147/PPA.S53795 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Kane JM, Kishimoto T, Correll CU |title=Assessing the comparative effectiveness of long-acting injectable vs. oral antipsychotic medications in the prevention of relapse provides a case study in comparative effectiveness research in psychiatry |journal=J Clin Epidemiol |volume=66 |issue=8 Suppl |pages=S37–41 |date=August 2013 |pmid=23849151 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.01.012 |pmc=3742035 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Fusar-Poli P, Kempton MJ, Rosenheck RA |title=Efficacy and safety of second-generation long-acting injections in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials |journal=Int Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=57–66 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23165366 |doi=10.1097/YIC.0b013e32835b091f |s2cid=24778797 }}</ref>

=== 2010 hip-replacement recall ===
{{Main|2010 DePuy Hip Recall}}
On August 24, 2010, DePuy, a subsidiary of American giant Johnson & Johnson, recalled its ASR (articular surface replacement) hip prostheses from the market. DePuy said the recall was due to unpublished National Joint Registry data showing a 12% revision rate for resurfacing at five years and an ASR XL revision rate of 13%. All hip prostheses fail in some patients, but it is expected that the rate will be about 1% a year.<ref name="Out of joint">{{Cite news | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d2905.full | title = Out of joint: The story of the ASR | date = May 14, 2011 | author=Deborah Cohen }}</ref>
Pathologically, the failing prosthesis had several effects. Metal debris from wear of the implant led to a reaction that destroyed the soft tissues surrounding the joint, leaving some patients with long term disability. Ions of cobalt and chromium—the metals from which the implant was made—were also released into the blood and cerebral spinal fluid in some patients.<ref name="fda1">{{Cite news | url = https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/MetalonMetalHipImplants/ucm241604.htm | title = FDA.

In March 2013, a jury in Los Angeles ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay more than $8.3 million in damages to a Montana man in the first of more than 10,000 lawsuits pending against the company in connection with the now-recalled DePuy hip.<ref name="Meier">{{Cite news|last=Meier|first=Barry|title=J.&J.

=== Use of the Red Cross symbol ===
{{Further|Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Use of the emblems}}
[[File:Flag of the Red Cross.svg|thumb|150px|Flag of the [[Red Cross]]]]
Johnson & Johnson registered the [[Red Cross]] as a U.S. trademark for "medicinal and surgical plasters" in 1905 and has used the design since 1887.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=71013666|title=Trademark Status & Document Retrieval|work=uspto.gov}}</ref> The [[Geneva Conventions]], which reserved the [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Red Cross|Red Cross emblem]] for specific uses, were first approved in 1864 and ratified by the United States in 1882. However, the emblem was not protected by U.S. law for the use of the [[American Red Cross]] and the U.S. military until after Johnson & Johnson had obtained its trademark. A clause in this law (now 18 U.S.C. 706) permits this pre-existing use of the Red Cross to continue.

<!-- Please do NOT insert any further assertions that continued Johnson & Johnson use of the Red Cross violates the Geneva Conventions; as a the paragraph below states, the U.S. specifically excluded that application of the Geneva Conventions thru a reservation. -->
A declaration made by the U.S. upon its ratification of the 1949 Geneva Conventions includes a [[Reservation (law)|reservation]] that pre-1905 U.S. domestic uses of the Red Cross, such as Johnson & Johnson's, would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on "aircraft, vessels, vehicles, buildings or other structures, or upon the ground," i.e., uses which could be confused with its military uses.<ref>[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/NORM/D6B53F5B5D14F35AC1256402003F9920?OpenDocument U.S. reservations to the 1949 Geneva Conventions] ([[International Committee of the Red Cross]] website)</ref> This means that the U.S. did not agree to any interpretation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that would overrule Johnson & Johnson's trademark. The American Red Cross continues to recognize the validity of Johnson & Johnson's trademark.<ref>[http://www.redcross.org/pressrelease/0,1077,0_314_6910,00.html American Red Cross Defends Use of Emblem and Mission] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818044717/http://www.redcross.org/pressrelease/0,1077,0_314_6910,00.html# |date=August 18, 2007 }} ([[American Red Cross]] press release, August 10, 2007)</ref>

In August 2007, Johnson & Johnson filed a lawsuit against the [[American Red Cross]] (ARC), demanding that the charity halt the use of the red cross symbol on products it sells to the public, though the company takes no issue with the charity's use of the mark for non-profit purposes.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118662527980592590 "Red Cross Is Sued by J&J Over Signature Emblem"] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' August 9, 2007</ref> In May 2008, the judge in the case dismissed most of Johnson & Johnson's claims, and a month later the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached in which both parties would continue to use the symbol.<ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/business/18cross.html | title = Claim Over Red Cross Symbol Is Settled |work=The New York Times | date = June 18, 2008 |last1=Saul|first1=Stephanie|author-link1=Stephanie Saul }}</ref>

The class action alleged that Johnson & Johnson, which "aggressively marketed" the implants "failed to properly warn patients and surgeons of the risk, or test the devices adequately".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jul/04/vaginal-mesh-risks-downplayed-by-johnson-johnson-court-told|title=Vaginal mesh risks downplayed by Johnson & Johnson, court told|first=Christopher|last=Knaus|date=July 4, 2017|website=the Guardian}}</ref> Emails between executives show the company was aware of the risks in 2005 but still went ahead and made the product available.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/27/vaginal-mesh-implant-sold-despite-warnings-could-cause-pain-johnson-johnson|title=Pharma giant sold mesh implant despite pain warnings|last=Devlin|first=Hannah|date=2018-11-27|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-11-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In October 2019, the company and its subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. reached a settlement with 41 states and the District of Columbia, with no admission of liability, in a suit alleging deceptive marketing of transvaginal surgical-mesh devices. The suit also alleges that the company failed to disclose risks associated with the product, which J&J pulled from the market in 2012. The amount settled in the suit was about US$117 million.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sebastian |first1=Dave |title=Johnson & Johnson to Pay $117 Million Over Surgical Device Marketing |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnson-to-pay-117-million-over-surgical-device-marketing-11571334613 |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones and Company |date=17 October 2019 |location=New York NY}}</ref>

=== Baby powder ===
In February 2016, J&J was ordered to pay $72 million in damages to the family of Jacqueline Fox, a 62-year-old woman who died of ovarian cancer in 2015: the company said it would appeal.<ref name="BBC">{{Cite news|title=Johnson & Johnson hit with $72m damages in talc-cancer case|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-35648252|access-date=24 February 2016|work=BBC News|date=24 February 2016}}</ref>

By March 2017, over 1,000 U.S. women had sued J&J for covering up the possible cancer risk from its Baby Powder product; the company says that 70 percent of its Baby Powder is used by adults.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-baby-powder-cancer-lawsuits/ Johnson & Johnson Has a Baby Powder Problem] Bloomberg, Retrieved April 20, 2017.</ref>

In August 2017, a California jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $417 million to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer after using the company's talc-based products like Johnson's Baby Powder for feminine hygiene. The verdict included $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages. J&J said they will appeal the verdict.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-cancer-lawsuit/jj-ordered-to-pay-417-million-in-trial-over-talc-cancer-risks-idUSKCN1B121D|title=J&J ordered to pay $417 million in trial over talc cancer risks|date=August 21, 2017|via=Reuters}}</ref>

In October 2017, the [[Missouri]] Eastern District appeals court on Tuesday threw out a $72 million jury verdict. The appeals court ruled 3-0 that Jacqueline Fox's lawsuit lacked jurisdiction in Missouri because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that imposed limits on where injury lawsuit can be filed which ". . . establishing a lawsuit's jurisdiction requires a stronger connection between the forum state and a plaintiff's claims."  Subsequently, this ruling would kill three other recent St. Louis jury verdicts of more than $200 million combined. Fox, 62, of [[Birmingham, Alabama]], died in 2015, about four months before her trial was held in [[St. Louis]] Circuit Court. She was among 65 plaintiffs, of whom only two were from Missouri.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-appeals-court-tosses-out-million-dollar-johnson-johnson-talcum/article_e976d9eb-c9dc-5fdf-b136-8d94bc6cfbdd.html|title=Missouri appeals court tosses out $72 million Johnson & Johnson talcum powder verdict|first=Joel|last=Currier}}</ref>

In July 2018, a [[St. Louis]] jury awarded nearly US$4.7 billion in damages to 22 women and their families after they claimed asbestos in Johnson & Johnson talcum powder caused their ovarian cancer.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Bever |first1=Lindsey |title=Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $4.7 billion to women who say baby powder gave them cancer |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/07/13/johnson-johnson-ordered-to-pay-4-7-billion-to-women-who-say-baby-powder-gave-them-cancer/ |website=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=28 July 2018 |language=en |date=13 July 2018}}</ref>  Conversely, in December 2019, a St. Louis jury ruled in favor of Johnson & Johnson in the case of a single plaintiff who had used the company's talc-containing baby powder for thirty years with a similar claim.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/st-louis-jury-sides-with-johnson-johnson-in-talc-case/|title=St. Louis jury sides with Johnson & Johnson in talc case|last=Salter|first=Jim|date=23 December 2019|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=24 Dec 2019|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>  In 2019, the company's CEO, Alex Gorsky, declined to appear at a United States congressional hearing on the safety of J&J's Baby Powder and other talc-based cosmetics. J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz said that the subcommittee had rejected the company's offers to send a talc testing expert or a J&J executive in charge of consumer products.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/johnson-johnson-ceo-refuses-attend-hearing-carcinogens-191210004346338.html|title=Johnson & Johnson CEO refuses to attend US hearing on carcinogens|date=2019-12-10|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>

In August 2018, J&J said that it removed several chemicals from baby powder products and re-engineered them to make consumers more confident that products were safer for children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Companies/f2z1TqJx9HtNRwmAEiIXXK/Johnson-and-Johnsonremoveschemicals-to-make-products-safer.html|title=Johnson and Johnson removes chemicals to make products safer|access-date=25 August 2018}}</ref>

In December 2018, with 11,700 people suing J&J over cancers allegedly caused by baby powder, the company was forced to release internal documents. The documents showed that the company had known about asbestos contamination since at least as early as 1971 and had spent decades finding ways to conceal the evidence from the public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/johnson-johnson-knew-decades-asbestos-lurked-its-baby-powder-n948016|title=Johnson & Johnson knew for decades that asbestos lurked in some of its baby powder|website=NBC News}}</ref> On December 19, the company lost its request to reverse a jury verdict that ruled in favor of the accusers, which required the company to pay $4.14 billion in punitive damages and $550 million in compensatory damages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/jj-loses-its-battle-to-overturn-a-4-7b-baby-power-verdict|title=J&J loses its battle to overturn a $4.7B baby powder verdict|last=Scipioni|first=Jade|date=2018-12-19|website=FOXBusiness|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-19}}</ref> Though [[asbestos]] is a known [[carcinogen]], the potential link between asbestos-free talc and cancer also alleged in these lawsuits is a subject of scientific controversy, as discussed on the Neurologica blog by [[Steven Novella]]. A large study performed in 2003 found that ovarian cancer risk increased from a baseline of 0.0121% to 0.0161% in people who reported regularly using talc in the genital area. Two more studies over the next twelve years, which also relied on [[self-report]]ing, had similar results. However, none of the three studies showed a relationship between how long someone used talc and how much their cancer risk increased, which is expected in experiments with carcinogens and other toxic substances (see [[dose-response relationship]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-johnson-and-johnson-talc-cancer-case/|title=The Johnson and Johnson Talc Cancer Case|author=Steven Novella|website=Neurologica blog|access-date=2019-09-30|author-link=Steven Novella}}</ref>

In May 2020, in response to declining demand, J&J announced it would discontinue the sale of talc-based baby powder in the United States and Canada, but will continue to sell it in other markets. In a statement, the company said existing retail inventory of the talc-based powder will sell until it runs out, while the company's cornstarch-based baby powder will continue to sell in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Johnson & Johnson to discontinue sales of talc-based baby powder in U.S., Canada|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/johnson-johnson-talc-baby-powder-discontinued-us-canada/|last=Albert|first=Victoria|date=May 19, 2020|website=CBS News|language=en-US|access-date=May 19, 2020}}</ref>

=== Opioid epidemic ===

====Northeastern Ohio Settlement====

In October 2019, the company agreed to a settlement of US$20.4 million with two Ohio counties – Cuyahoga (Cleveland) and Summit (Akron). The settlement allows the company avoidance of a trial accusing J&J and many other pharmaceutical manufacturers of helping to spark the US opioid epidemic. The trial, scheduled for October 2019, was thought to be an indicator for thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against many drug manufacturers. The arrangement, which contains no admission of liability by the company, provides the counties US$10 million in cash, $5 million for legal expenses and $5.4 million in contributions to opioid-related non-profit organizations in the counties.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Randazzo |first1=Sara |title=Johnson & Johnson Agrees to Settle Ohio Opioid Lawsuits for $20.4 Million |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnson-agrees-to-settle-ohio-opioid-lawsuits-for-20-4-million-11569977306?mod=article_inline |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones and Company |date=1 October 2019 |location=New York NY}}</ref>
