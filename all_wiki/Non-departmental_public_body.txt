In the [[United Kingdom]], '''non-departmental public body''' ('''NDPB''') is a classification applied by the [[Cabinet Office]], [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], the [[Scottish Government]] and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] to [[quango]]s (quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations). NDPBs are not an integral part of any government department and carry out their work at arm's length from ministers, although ministers are ultimately responsible to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for the activities of bodies sponsored by their department.

The term includes the four types of NDPB (executive, advisory, tribunal and independent monitoring boards) but excludes public corporations and public broadcasters ([[BBC]], [[Channel 4]] and [[S4C]]).<ref>Cabinet Office (2007) ''[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081211180957/http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/documents/pdf/public_bodies/public_bodies_2007.pdf Public Bodies 2007 (from the UK Government Web Archive)]'', p. 6</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Bradley, A.

==Types of body==
The UK Government classifies bodies into four main types. The Scottish Government also has a fifth category- [[NHS Scotland|NHS bodies]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/public-bodies/about/Categories |title=Public bodies: Public body information: NDPB Categories |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>

===Advisory NDPBs===
These bodies consist of boards which advise ministers on particular policy areas. They are often supported by a small secretariat from the parent department and any expenditure is paid for by that department.

===Executive NDPBs===
These bodies usually deliver a particular public service and are overseen by a board rather than ministers.  Appointments are made by ministers following the Code of Practice of the [[Commissioner for Public Appointments]]. They employ their own staff and are allocated their own budgets.

===Tribunal NDPBs===
{{main|Tribunals in the United Kingdom}}
These bodies have jurisdiction in an area of the [[law]]. They are co-ordinated by [[Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service]], an [[executive agency]] of the [[Ministry of Justice]], and supervised by the [[Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council]], itself a NDPB sponsored by the Ministry of Justice.

===Independent monitoring boards===
{{Main|Independent Monitoring Board}}
These bodies were formerly known as "boards of visitors" and are responsible for the state of prisons, their administration and the treatment of prisoners. The [[Home Office]] is responsible for their costs, and has to note all expenses.

==Contrast with executive agencies, non-ministerial departments and quangos==
NDPB differ from [[Executive Agency|executive agencies]] as they are not created to carry out ministerial orders or policy, instead they are more or less self-determining and enjoy greater independence.  They are also not directly part of government like a [[non-ministerial government department]] being at a remove from both ministers and any elected assembly or parliament. Typically an NDPB would be established under [[statute]] and be accountable to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] rather than to [[Her Majesty's Government]]. This arrangement allows more financial independence since the government is obliged to provide funding to meet statutory obligations.

NDPBs are commonly referred to as [[quango]]s. However, this term originally referred to bodies that are, at least ostensibly, [[non-government organisations]], but nonetheless perform governmental functions.

==History, numbers and powers==
In March 2009 there were nearly 800 public bodies that were sponsored by the UK Government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/PublicBodies2009_tcm6-35808.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011170940/http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/PublicBodies2009_tcm6-35808.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 October 2011 |title=Public bodies, 2009 |publisher=Cabinet Office |accessdate=10 September 2009 }}</ref> This total included 198 executive NDPBs, 410 advisory bodies, 33 tribunals, 21 public corporations, the [[Bank of England]], 2 public broadcasting authorities and 23 NHS bodies. However, the classification is conservative and does not include bodies that are the responsibility of [[devolved government]], various lower tier boards (including a considerable number within the NHS), and also other boards operating in the public sector (e.g. school governors and police authorities).

These appointed bodies performed a large variety of tasks, for example [[health trust]]s, or the [[Welsh Development Agency]], and by 1992 were responsible for some 25% of all government expenditure in the UK. According to the Cabinet Office their total expenditure for the financial year 2005–06 was £167 billion.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070221120000/http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/other/agencies/publications/pdf/public-bodies/publicbodies2006.pdf Official list] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]])</ref>

==Criticism==
{{see also|2010 UK quango reforms}}

Critics argued that the system was open to abuse as most NDPBs had their members directly appointed by [[government minister]]s without an election or consultation with the people. The [[UK press|press]], critical of what was perceived as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives']] complacency in power in the 1990s, presented much material interpreted as evidence of questionable government practices.

This concern led to the formation of a [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.public-standards.gov.uk/ |title=Committee on Standards in Public Life |publisher=Public-standards.gov.uk |accessdate=2014-04-01}}</ref> (the Nolan Committee) which first reported in 1995 and recommended the creation of a "public appointments commissioner" to make sure that appropriate standards were met in the appointment of members of QUANGOs.  The Government accepted the recommendation, and the [[Commissioner for Public Appointments|Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publicappointmentscommissioner.org/|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081209182758/http://publicappointmentscommissioner.org/|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 December 2008|title=Homepage|first=sapere audemus|last=Limited|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref> was established in November 1995.

While in opposition, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] promised to reduce the number and power of NDPBs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtcp.co.uk/2002series/show5.html |title=Mark Thomas story on Quangos |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2002-12-12 |accessdate=2014-04-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704075110/http://www.mtcp.co.uk/2002series/show5.html |archive-date=July 4, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4255709.stm |title=UK's 'useless' quangos under fire |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2005 |accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> The use of NDPBs continued under the Labour government in office from 1997 to 2010, though the political controversy associated with NDPBs in the mid-1990s for the most part died away.

In 2010 the UK's Conservative-Liberal coalition published a review of NDPBs recommending closure or merger of nearly two hundred bodies, and the transfer of others to the private sector.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101125071349/http://download.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/ndpb/public-bodies-list.pdf List of NDPBs], [[Cabinet Office]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107190257/http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101125071349/http://download.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/ndpb/public-bodies-list.pdf |date=November 7, 2014 }}</ref> This process was colloquially termed the "bonfire of the quangos".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/bonfire-of-the-quangos-promised |title='Bonfire of the quangos' revealed |work=[[Channel 4 News]] |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>

== Classification in national accounts ==
NDPBs are classified under code S.13112 of the [[European System of Accounts]] (ESA.95). However, [[Statistics UK]] does not break out the detail for these bodies and they are consolidated into General Government (S.1311).<ref>http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/na-classifications/the-ons-classification-process/sector-classification-index.xls</ref>
