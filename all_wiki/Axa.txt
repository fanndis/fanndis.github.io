==The Axa name==
Despite being written by the company in upper case, "AXA" is not an [[acronym]], but was chosen because its name can be pronounced easily by people who speak any language. After acquiring the Drouot Group in 1982, Chairman and CEO [[Claude Bébéar]] hired an outside consultant to conduct a computer-aided search for a new name.  Bébéar wanted a short and snappy name to convey vitality and could be pronounced the same way in every language, consistent with the group's desire for an international presence. Initially, "Elan" was the top choice, but Canadian executives balked because "elan" is the French word for a moose or elk.  In 1985, Bébéar chose the name Axa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.axa.com/en/group/history/axa-brand/ |title=The AXA brand |publisher=Axa.com |access-date=December 20, 2012 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208094446/http://www.axa.com/en/group/history/axa%2Dbrand/ |archive-date=December 8, 2012 }}</ref>

==Operations==

=== United Kingdom ===
Axa trades in the United Kingdom as [[Axa UK]] using a number of subsidiaries such as Axa Insurance, Axa Investment Managers, Axa Wealth and [[Axa PPP Healthcare]].  Axa PPP Healthcare was created when Axa bought [[Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance|Guardian Royal Exchange]] (GRE), though it subsequently sold the other parts of GRE to [[Aegon N.V.|Aegon]]. The company also owns the online insurer [[Swiftcover]], distribution business Bluefin and fund manager Architas. In January 2007 Axa was reorganised into "strategic business units" (SBU's) aimed at competing within their specific markets.

In September 2013, Axa Wealth was fined £1.8 million by the FCA for failing to ensure it gave suitable investment advice to its customers. The regulator says it found "serious defects" in the way Axa advisers in Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and the West Bromwich Building Society advised customers on investments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/news-and-analysis/news/axa-wealth-fined-18m-for-investment-advice-failings/2000357.article|title=Axa Wealth fined £1.8m for investment advice failings|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003131300/http://www.moneymarketing.co.uk/news-and-analysis/news/axa-wealth-fined-18m-for-investment-advice-failings/2000357.article|archive-date=October 3, 2013|date=September 19, 2013}}</ref>

====Axa Health====
{{main|Axa PPP Healthcare}}
AXA Health is a UK private [[medical insurance]] provider.

The company has its headquarters in the town of [[Tunbridge Wells]] in [[Kent]], England, and is the town's largest private-sector employer.

===On the Isle of Man===
Axa Isle of Man Limited was originally created as a subsidiary of Axa Sun Life in the United Kingdom, but since the Isle of Man is not a part of the United Kingdom it is regulated instead by the laws of the Isle of Man. Axa Isle of Man advertises itself as a repository for citizens of the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands who seek to shelter their assets from taxation.

While the company trades upon the Axa logo, name and group advertising which promotes the total wealth of the group, the assets of the Isle of Man company are limited to those of the Isle of Man company itself.

==Headquarters==
Axa headquarters is located in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.axa.com/en/question.aspx|title=AXA - F.A.Q.|access-date=July 7, 2010|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709105223/http://www.axa.com/en/question.aspx|archive-date=July 9, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Axa, which already owned 23 Avenue Matignon, acquired the former Hotel de La Vaupalière, an 18th-century building, in the late 1990s. Architect [[Ricardo Bofill]] integrated the facade of the hotel with a modern glass building that covers the courtyard that the hotel also occupies. The complex serves as Axa's head office.<ref>[http://www.journaldunet.com/economie/reportage/les-sieges-sociaux-des-entreprises-du-cac-40/axa-allie-patrimoine-et-modernite.shtml Axa allie patrimoine et modernité] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928181246/http://www.journaldunet.com/economie/reportage/les-sieges-sociaux-des-entreprises-du-cac-40/axa-allie-patrimoine-et-modernite.shtml |date=September 28, 2011 }}.

== Philanthropy ==

Besides its artistic and social philanthropic initiatives (Axa Heart in Action),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.axa-atoutcoeur.fr |title=axa-atoutcoeur.fr |publisher=axa-atoutcoeur.fr |access-date=December 20, 2012 |url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228082802/http://www.axa-atoutcoeur.fr/ |archive-date=December 28, 2012 }}</ref> Axa created the Axa Research Fund in 2008. Endowed with €100 million, it provides support for research focused on understanding and preventing the risks threatening the environment, human life and society.<ref name="AXA Research Fund">{{cite news|title=AXA and CARE team up for risk prevention education|url=http://www.preventionweb.net/news/view/18964|access-date=September 27, 2016|agency=Prevention Web|publisher=Axa Group|date=April 18, 2011|url-status = live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001195841/http://www.preventionweb.net/news/view/18964|archive-date=October 1, 2016}}</ref>

256 basic-research projects were funded within three years, including 230 young researchers, PhDs or in postdoctoral year, working in laboratories all around the world. Axa also gathers every year the young fellows to meet a world-class researcher, exchange best practices and network.

The Fund has also awarded eleven endowments for several million euros supporting research institutions of excellence ([[HEC Paris]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Bristol]], [[London School of Economics]], [[Met Office]], [[Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale|INSERM]], [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques|IHES]]). These research and education chairs intend to attract the best scientists. For example, the Axa Polytechnique Chair in Cellular Cardiovascular Engineering,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chair-axa-cce.polytechnique.fr |title=chair-axa-cce.polytechnique.fr |publisher=chair-axa-cce.polytechnique.fr |access-date=December 20, 2012 |url-status = live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110826134843/http://chair-axa-cce.polytechnique.fr/ |archive-date=August 26, 2011 }}</ref> held by Abdul Barakat, aims to promote research on cardiovascular diseases, but also to train and develop young researchers through extended educational programs.

After joining the Access to Medicine Foundation, Axa allocates a donation of 500,000 euros to the Foundation's activities relating to the prevention of infectious diseases and the response to pandemics such as COVID-19.<ref>{{Cite web|title=AXA IM s'associe à la Fondation Access to Medicine|url=https://www.allnews.ch/content/corporate/axa-im-sassocie-%C3%A0-la-fondation-access-medicine|date=2020-05-12|website=Allnews|language=fr|access-date=2020-05-12}}</ref>
