==Affected populations==

Governmental family planning programs emerged in the late nineteenth century and have continued to progress through the twenty-first century. During this time, feminists began advocating for reproductive choice, but eugenicists and hygienists were advocating for low income and disabled peoples to be sterilized or have their fertility tightly regulated in order to clean or perfect nations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Population and Reproductive Rights: Feminists Perspectives from the South|last=Correa|first=Sonia|publisher=Zed Books Ltd|year=1994|isbn=9781856492843|location=London|page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7dbzfZ5EDLsC&pg=PA11 }}</ref><ref name=":7">{{Cite book|title=Pregnancy and Power: A Short History of Reproductive Politics in America|last=Solinger|first=Rickie|publisher=New York University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780814798287|location=New York|page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ngTCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA90}}</ref> The second half of the twentieth century saw national governments uptake of neo-Malthusian ideology that directly linked population growth to increased (and uncontrollable) poverty, which during the embrace of capitalism, meant that countries were unable to economically develop due to this poverty. Any type of birth control can count as a method of population control if once administered women have no control over its use. These contraceptive methods include sterilization, Depo-Provera, Norplant, and IUDs. Much of these governmental population control programs were focused on using sterilization as the main avenue to reduce high birth rates, even though public acknowledgement that sterilization made an impact on the population levels of the developing world is still widely lacking.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Matters of Choice: Puerto Rican Women's Struggle for Reproductive Freedom|last=Lopez|first=Iris|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780813543734|location=New Brunswick|page=xiii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pGzdr4r1pMMC&pg=PR13}}</ref> Early population programs of the twentieth century were marked as part of the eugenics movement, with [[Nazi eugenics|Nazi Germany's programs]] providing the most well-known examples of sterilization of disabled people, paired with encouraging white Germans who fit the "[[Aryan race]]" phenotype to rapidly reproduce.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Polish Doctor in the Nazi Camps: My Mother's Memories of Imprisonment, Immigration, and a Life Remade|last=Rylko-Bauer|first=Barbara |author-link=Barbara Rylko-Bauer |publisher=University of Oklahoma |year=2014 |isbn= 9780806145860|pages=91–92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VrqAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA91 }}</ref> In the 1970s, population control programs focused on the "third world" to help curtail over population of poverty areas that were beginning to "develop" (Duden 1992).

In May 2014, the [[World Health Organization]], [[OHCHR]], [[UN Women]], [[UNAIDS]], [[UNDP]], [[UNFPA]] and [[UNICEF]] issued a joint statement on ''Eliminating forced, coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization, An interagency statement''. The report references the involuntary sterilization of a number of specific population groups. They include:

* [[Women]], especially in relation to coercive population control policies, and particularly including women living with [[HIV]], indigenous and ethnic minority girls and women. Indigenous and ethnic minority women often face "wrongful stereotyping based on gender, race and ethnicity".
** Funding of mothers on welfare by HEW (Health, Education, and Welfare) covers roughly 90% of cost and doctors are likely to concur with the compulsory sterilization of mothers on welfare.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Dear Sisters|last1=Baxandall|first1=Rosalyn|last2=Gordon|first2=Linda|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0-465-01707-2|location=New York, NY|pages=[https://archive.org/details/dearsistersdispa0000unse/page/151 151–152]|url=https://archive.org/details/dearsistersdispa0000unse/page/151}}</ref> Threats to cease welfare occur when women are hesitant to consent.<ref name=":0" />
* [[Disabled people]], often perceived as asexual. Women with intellectual disabilities are "often treated as if they have no control, or should have no control, over their sexual and reproductive choices". Other rationales include menstrual management for "women who have or are perceived to have difficulties coping with or managing menses, or whose health conditions (such as epilepsy) or behaviour are negatively affected by menses."
* [[Intersex]] persons, who "are often subjected to cosmetic and other non-medically indicated surgeries performed on their reproductive organs, without their informed consent or that of their parents, and without taking into consideration the views of the children involved", often as a "sex-normalizing" treatment.
* [[Transgender]] persons, "as a prerequisite to receiving gender-affirmative treatment and gender-marker changes".

The report recommends a range of guiding principles for medical treatment, including ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making, ensuring non-discrimination, accountability and access to remedies.<ref name="who-2014" />

== As a part of human population planning ==
Human population planning is the practice of artificially altering the rate of growth of a human population. Historically, human population planning has been implemented by limiting the population's [[birth rate]], usually by government mandate, and has been undertaken as a response to factors including high or increasing levels of [[poverty]], [[carrying capacity|environmental concerns]], religious reasons, and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. While population planning can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, some programs have exposed them to exploitation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.populationconcern.org.uk/free_downloads.asp |title=Interact Worldwide Downloads |publisher=Interact Worldwide |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115221710/http://www.populationconcern.org.uk/free_downloads.asp |archive-date=November 15, 2011 }}</ref>

[[Bangladesh]] has a long running government operated civilian sterilization program as a part of its population control policy, where poor women and men are mainly targeted. The government offers 2000 [[Bangladeshi taka|Bangladeshi Taka]] (US$24) for the women who are persuaded to undergo [[tubal ligation]] and for the men who are persuaded to undergo [[vasectomy]]. Women are also offered a [[sari]] (a garment worn by women in Indian subcontinent) and men are offered a [[lungi]] (a garment for men) to wear for undergoing sterilization.

In 1965, the targeted number of sterilizations per month was 600–1000 in contrast to the insertion of 25,000 [[IUDs]], which was increased in 1978 to about 50,000 sterilizations per month on average.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=AR|first1=Khan|last2=I|first2=Swenson|date=1978|title=Acceptability of male sterilization in Bangladesh: its problems and perspectives|url=https://www.popline.org/node/444385|journal=Bangladesh Development Studies|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113002952/https://www.popline.org/node/444385|archive-date=2017-11-13|access-date=2017-11-12}}</ref> A 50% rise in the amount paid to men coincided with a doubling of the number of vasectomies between 1980 and 1981.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=L|first1=Liskin|last2=JM|first2=Pile|last3=WF|first3=Quillan|date=1983|title=Vasectomy—safe and simple|url=https://www.popline.org/node/402465|journal=Population Reports.

On 16 December 1982, Bangladesh's military ruler [[Lieutenant general (Bangladesh)|Lieutenant General]] [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] launched a two-year mass sterilization program for Bangladeshi women and men. About 3,000 women and men were planned to be sterilized on 16 December 1982 (the opening day). Ershad's government trained 1,200 doctors and 25,000 field workers who must conduct two tubal ligations and two vasectomies each month to earn their salaries. And the government wanted to persuade 1.4 million people, both women and men to undergo sterilization within two years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/12/14/The-Bangladesh-government-plans-a-mass-voluntary-sterilization-of/3265408690000/|title=The Bangladesh government plans a mass voluntary sterilization of...|work=UPI|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113002940/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/12/14/The-Bangladesh-government-plans-a-mass-voluntary-sterilization-of/3265408690000/|archive-date=2017-11-13}}</ref> One population control expert called it 'the largest sterilization program in the world'.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/12/15/Impoverished-Bangladesh-plans-sterilization-program/6350408776400/|title=Impoverished Bangladesh plans sterilization program|work=UPI|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112185727/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/12/15/Impoverished-Bangladesh-plans-sterilization-program/6350408776400/|archive-date=2017-11-12}}</ref> By January 1983, 40,000 government field workers were employed in Bangladesh's 65,000 villages to persuade women and men to undergo sterilization and to promote usage of birth-control across the country.<ref name=":2" />

Food subsidies under the group feeding program (VGF) were given to only those women with certificates showing that they had undergone tubal ligation.<ref>Miles and Shiva 1993</ref>

In the 1977 study, a one-year follow-up of 585 men sterilized at vasectomy camps in Shibpur and Shalna in rural Bangladesh showed that almost half of the men were dissatisfied with their vasectomies.

58% of the men said their ability to work had decreased in the last year. 2–7% of the men said their sexual performance decreases. 30.6% of the Shibpur and 18.9% of the Shalna men experienced severe pain during the vasectomy. The men also said they had not received all of the incentives they had been promised.<ref name=":3" />

According to another study on 5042 women and 264 men who underwent sterilization, complications such as painful urination, shaking chills, fever for at least two days, frequent urination, bleeding from the incision, sore with pus, stitches or skin breaking open, weakness and [[dizziness]] arose after the sterilization.

The person's sex, the sponsor and workload in the sterilization center, and the dose of [[sedative]]s administered to women were significantly associated with specific postoperative complaints. Five women died during the study, resulting in a death-to-case rate of 9.9/10,000 tubectomies (tubal ligations); four deaths were due to [[respiratory arrest]] caused by overuse of sedatives. The death-to-case rate of 9.9/10,000 tubectomies (tubal ligation) in this study is similar to the 10.0 deaths/10,000 cases estimated on the basis of a 1979 follow-up study in an Indian female sterilization camp. The presence of a complaint before the operation was generally a good predictor of postoperative complaints. Centers performing fewer than 200 procedures were associated with more complaints.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Rosenberg|first1=M. J.|last2=Rochat|first2=R.

According to another study based on 20 sterilization-attributable deaths in [[Dacca Division|Dacca]] (now Dhaka) and [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]] Divisions in Bangladesh, from January 1, 1979 to March 31, 1980, overall, the sterilization-attributable death-to-case rate was 21.3 deaths/100,000 sterilizations. The death rate for vasectomy was 1.6 times higher than that for tubal ligation. [[Anesthesia]] overdosage was the leading cause of death following tubal ligation along with [[tetanus]] (24%), where intraperitoneal hemorrhage (14%), and infection other than tetanus (5%) was other leading causes of death.

Two women (10%) died from [[pulmonary embolism]] after tubal ligation; one (5%) died from each of the following: [[anaphylaxis]] from anti-tetanus serum, [[heat stroke]], [[small bowel obstruction]], and aspiration of vomitus. All seven men died from scrotal infections after vasectomy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=D. A.|last2=Peterson|first2=H. B.|last3=Rosenberg|first3=M. J.|last4=Fishburne|first4=J.

According to a second epidemiologic investigation of deaths attributable to sterilization in Bangladesh, where all deaths resulting from sterilizations performed nationwide between September 16, 1980, and April 15, 1981, were investigated and analyzed, nineteen deaths from tubal ligation were attributed to 153,032 sterilizations (both tubal ligation and vasectomy), for an overall death-to-case rate of 12.4 deaths per 100,000 sterilizations. This rate was lower than that (21.3) for sterilizations performed in Dacca (now Dhaka) and Rajshahi Divisions from January 1, 1979, to March 31, 1980, although this difference was not statistically significant. Anesthesia overdosage, tetanus, and [[hemorrhage]] (bleeding) were the leading causes of death.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=D. A.|last2=Satterthwaite|first2=A. P.|last3=Rochat|first3=R.

Bangladesh is planning to introduce a sterilization program in its overcrowded [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugee camps, where nearly a million refugees are fighting for space, after efforts to encourage birth control failed. Since 25 August 2017, more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from [[Rakhine State|Rakhine state]], [[Myanmar]] to neighboring Bangladesh, which is a Muslim majority country, following a military crackdown against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine. Sabura, a Rohingya mother of seven, said her husband believed the couple could support a large family.

"I spoke to my husband about birth control measures. But he is not convinced. He was given two condoms but he did not use them," she said. "My husband said we need more children as we have land and property (in Rakhine). We don't have to worry to feed them."

District family planning authorities have managed to distribute just 549 packets of condoms among the refugees, amid reports they are reluctant to use them. They have asked the government to approve a plan to provide vasectomies for men and tubectomies (tubal ligation) for women in the camps.

One volunteer, Farhana Sultana, said the women she spoke to believed birth control was a sin and others saw it as against the tenets of Islam.

Bangladeshi officials say about 20,000 Rohingya refugee women are pregnant and 600 have given birth since arriving in the country, but this may not be accurate as many births take place without formal medical help.

Every month 250 Bangladeshi people undergo sterilization routinely under the government's sterilization program in the border town of [[Cox's Bazar District|Cox's Bazar]], where the Rohingya refugee Muslims have taken shelter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/28/bangladesh-to-offer-sterilisation-to-rohingya-in-refugee-camps|title=Bangladesh to offer sterilisation to Rohingya in refugee camps|last=France-Presse|first=Agence|date=2017-10-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104150415/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/28/bangladesh-to-offer-sterilisation-to-rohingya-in-refugee-camps|archive-date=2017-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bangladesh-sterilise-rohingya-muslims-population-burma-refugee-camps-a8026076.html|title=Bangladesh 'plans to offer to sterilise Rohingya Muslims' as refugee population grows|date=2017-10-29|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113003155/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/bangladesh-sterilise-rohingya-muslims-population-burma-refugee-camps-a8026076.html|archive-date=2017-11-13}}</ref>

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Compulsory sterilization in Canada}}

Two Canadian provinces ([[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]]) performed compulsory sterilization programs in the 20th century with eugenic aims. Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of [[institutionalization]], [[judgment]], and [[surgery]] as the American system. However, one notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals. Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.

The ''[[Sexual Sterilization Act]]'' of Alberta was enacted in 1928 and repealed in 1972. In 1995, [[Leilani Muir]] sued the Province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized against her will and without her permission in 1959. Since Muir's case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people. Nearly 850 Albertans who were sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were awarded C$142 million in damages.<ref>{{cite news|last=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)|title=Alberta Apologizes for Forced Sterilization|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|access-date=June 19, 2013|date=November 9, 1999|work=[[CBC News]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123020740/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/1999/11/02/sterilize991102.html|archive-date=November 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1VoyAAAAIBAJ&pg=5397%2C1039102 |title=Victims of sterilization finally get day in court.

===China===
''See also: [[One-child policy]] and [[Two-child policy]]''

In 1978, Chinese authorities became concerned with the possibility of a baby boom that the country could not handle, and they initialized the [[one-child policy]]. In order to effectively deal with the complex issues surrounding childbirth, the Chinese government placed great emphasis on family planning. Because this was such an important matter, the government thought it needed to be standardized, and so to this end laws were introduced in 2002.<ref name="Amnesty International">{{Cite news | title=Thousands at risk of forced sterilization in China | date=April 22, 2010 | access-date=April 9, 2012 | publisher=[[Amnesty International]] | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314193515/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/thousands-risk-forced-sterilization-china-2010-04-22 | archive-date=March 14, 2012 }}</ref> These laws uphold the basic tenets of what was previously put into practice, outlining the rights of the individuals and outlining what the Chinese government can and cannot do to enforce policy.

However, accusations have been raised from groups such as [[Amnesty International]], who have claimed that practices of compulsory sterilization have been occurring for people who have already reached their one child quota.<ref name="Amnesty International" /> These practices run contrary to the stated principles of the law, and seem to differ on a local level.

The Chinese government appears to be aware of these discrepancies in policy implementation on a local level. For example, The National Population and Family Planning Commission put forth in a statement that, “Some persons concerned in a few counties and townships of Linyi did commit practices that violated law and infringed upon legitimate rights and interests of citizens while conducting family planning work.” This statement comes in reference to some charges of forced sterilization and abortions in Linyi city of Shandong Province.<ref>{{Cite news | title=China acts on forced abortion | date=September 20, 2005 | access-date=April 9, 2012 | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210000256/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm | archive-date=February 10, 2009 }}</ref>

The policy requires a "social compensation fee" for those who have more than the legal number of children. According to Forbes editor Heng Shao, critics claims this fee is a toll on the poor but not the rich.<ref>Enforcement of One-Child Policy Targets 'The Rich and Famous' in Zhangzhou, China, ''[[Forbes]]'', September 20, 2013. {{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hengshao/2013/09/20/enforcement-of-one-child-policy-targets-the-rich-and-famous-in-zhangzhou-china/ |title=Enforcement of One-Child Policy Targets 'The Rich and Famous' in Zhangzhou, China |access-date=2017-09-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909011431/https://www.forbes.com/sites/hengshao/2013/09/20/enforcement-of-one-child-policy-targets-the-rich-and-famous-in-zhangzhou-china/ |archive-date=2017-09-09 }}</ref> But after 2018, the country has allowed parents to give birth to two children.

=== Colombia ===
The time period of 1964–1970 started Colombia's population policy development, including the foundation of PROFAMILIA and through the Ministry of Health the family planning program promoted the use of IUDs, the Pill, and sterilization as the main avenues for contraception. By 2005, Colombia had one of the world’s highest contraceptive usage rates at 76.9%, with female sterilization being the highest percentage of use at just over 30% (second highest is the IUD at around 12% and the pill around 10%<ref>{{Cite book|title=Against the Odds: Colombia's Role in the Family Planning Revolution|last=Measham and Lopez-Escobar|first=Anthony, Guillermo|publisher=World Bank Publisher|year=2007|pages=121–135}}</ref> (Measham and Lopez-Escobar 2007). In Colombia during the 1980s, sterilization was the second most popular choice of pregnancy prevention (after the Pill), and public healthcare organizations and funders (USAID, AVSC, IPPF) supported sterilization as a way to decrease abortions rates. While not directly forced into sterilization, women of lower socio-economic standing had significantly less options to afford family planning care as sterilizations were subsidized.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|title=Reproductive Rights and Wrongs: The Global Politics of Population Control|last=Hartmann|first=Betsy|publisher=Haymarket Books|year=2016|location=Chicago}}</ref>

One of the first acts by [[Adolf Hitler]] after the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] gave him de facto legal dictatorship over the [[Germany|German]] state was to pass the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] (''Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses'') in July 1933.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jkswAAAAIBAJ&pg=3703%2C266241 |title=Eugenics Courts Named in Reich.

Under it, all doctors in the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] were required to report any patients of theirs who were deemed [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]], characterized [[mentally ill]] (including [[schizophrenia]] and [[manic depression]]), [[epilepsy|epileptic]], blind, deaf, or physically deformed, and a steep monetary penalty was imposed for any patients who were not properly reported. Individuals suffering from [[alcoholism]] or [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]] could also be sterilized. The individual's case was then presented in front of a court of [[Nazism|Nazi]] officials and public health officers who would review their medical records, take testimony from friends and colleagues, and eventually decide whether or not to order a sterilization operation performed on the individual, using force if necessary. Though not explicitly covered by the law, 400 mixed-race "[[Rhineland Bastard]]s" were also sterilized beginning in 1937.<ref>Robert Proctor, ''Racial hygiene: Medicine under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988), and Gisela Bock, "Nazi sterilization and reproductive policies" in Dieter Kuntz, ed., ''Deadly medicine: creating the master race'' (Washington, D.C.: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2004).</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zzsbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=50wEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1710%2C6396277 Wallace R.

By the end of [[World War II]], over 400,000 individuals were sterilised under the German law and its revisions, most within its first four years of being enacted. When the issue of compulsory sterilisation was brought up at the [[Nuremberg trials]] after the war, many Nazis defended their actions on the matter by indicating that it was the United States itself from whom they had taken inspiration. The Nazis had many other eugenics-inspired [[racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial policies]], including their [[T-4 Euthanasia Programme|"euthanasia" programme]] in which around 70,000 people institutionalised or suffering from birth defects were killed.<ref>[[Ian Kershaw]], ''Hitler: A Profile in Power'', Chapter VI, first section (London, 1991, rev. 2001)</ref>

=== Guatemala ===
Guatemala is one country that resisted family planning programs, largely due to lack of governmental support, including civil war strife, and strong opposition from both the Catholic Church and Evangelical Christians until 2000, and as such, has the lowest prevalence of contraceptive usage in Latin America. In the 1980s, the archbishop of the country accused USAID of mass sterilizations of women without consent, but a President Reagan backed commission found the allegations to be false.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Guatemala: The Pioneering Days of the Family Planning Movement|last=Santiso-Galvez and Bertrand|first=Roberto; Jane T.|publisher=World Bank Publications|year=2007|pages=137–154}}</ref>

=== India ===
India's state of emergency [[The Emergency (India)|between 1975 and 1977]] included a family planning initiative that began in April 1976 through which the government hoped to lower India's ever increasing population. This program used propaganda and monetary incentives to, some may construe, inveigle citizens to get sterilized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/A-generation-of-lost-manhood/articleshow/47824811.cms|title=A generation of lost manhood|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107221309/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/A-generation-of-lost-manhood/articleshow/47824811.cms|archive-date=2016-01-07}}</ref> People who agreed to get sterilized would receive land, housing, and money or loans.<ref name=Relyingonhardandsoftsells>''Relying on Hard and Soft Sells India Pushes Sterilization'', New York Times, June 22, 2011.</ref> Because of this program, thousands of men received vasectomies, but due to much opposition and protest, the country switched to targeting women through coercion, withholding welfare or ration card benefits, or bribing them with food and money.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Kalpana|date=2017-04-01|title=In the name of reproductive rights: race, neoliberalism and the embodied violence of population policies|journal=New Formations|volume=91|issue=91|pages=50–68|doi=10.3898/newf:91.03.2017|s2cid=148987919|issn=0950-2378|url=https://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/20444/1/Kalpana%20Wilson%20New%20Formations%202017.pdf|access-date=2019-12-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428234457/http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/20444/1/Kalpana%20Wilson%20New%20Formations%202017.pdf|archive-date=2019-04-28|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Sanjay Gandhi]], the son of then-Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], was largely blamed for what turned out to be a failed program.<ref>{{Cite news | title=The Indira enigma | date=May 11, 2001 | access-date=July 28, 2006 | publisher=[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]] | url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1809/18090740.htm | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110074114/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1809/18090740.htm | archive-date=November 10, 2006 }}</ref> A strong backlash against any initiative associated with family planning followed the highly controversial program, the effect of which{{clarify|date=September 2017}}<!-- backlash--> continues into the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite news | title=Male involvement and contraceptive methods for men | date=September 1996 | access-date=July 28, 2006 | publisher=[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]] | url=http://www.malecontraceptives.org/articles/ringheim_article.php | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811233229/http://www.malecontraceptives.org/articles/ringheim_article.php | archive-date=August 11, 2006 }}</ref> Sterilization policies are still enforced targeting mostly indigenous and lower classed women being taken to “sterilization camps;” the most recent abuse coming to light in the death of 15 women in Chhattisgarh in 2014.<ref name=":6" />

=== Israel ===
In the late 2000s, reports in the Israeli media claimed that injections of long-acting contraceptive Depo-Provera had been forced on hundreds of [[Ethiopian Jews in Israel|Ethiopian-Jewish immigrants]] both in transit camps in Ethiopia and after their arrival in Israel. In 2009, feminist NGO [[Haifa Women's Coalition]] published a first survey on the story, which was followed up by [[Israeli Educational Television]] a few years later. Ethiopian-Jewish women said they were intimidated or tricked into taking the shot every three months. In 2016 Israel's State Comptroller concluded his inquiry into the affair by claiming that injections of Depo-Provera had not been forced on the women by the State of Israel. The Comptroller did not interview the complainants directly.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

===Peru===
In [[Peru]], President [[Alberto Fujimori]] (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] as a result of the ''[[Programa Nacional de Población]]'', a sterilization program put in place by his administration.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news | title=Mass sterilization scandal shocks Peru | date=July 24, 2002 | access-date=April 30, 2006 | work=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630062037/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm | archive-date=June 30, 2006 }}</ref> During his presidency, Fujimori put in place a program of forced sterilizations against [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous people]] (mainly the [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]]), in the name of a "[[public health]] plan", presented on July 28, 1995. The plan was principally financed using funds from [[USAID]] (36 million dollars), the [[Nippon Foundation]], and later, the [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA).<ref name=Diplo>[http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/05/BARTHELEMY/11190 Stérilisations forcées des Indiennes du Pérou] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510120620/http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2004/05/BARTHELEMY/11190 |date=2014-05-10 }}, ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', May 2004</ref> On September 9, 1995, Fujimori presented a Bill that would revise the "General Law of Population", in order to allow sterilization. Several contraceptive methods were also legalized, all measures that were strongly opposed by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], as well as the Catholic organization [[Opus Dei]]. In February 1996, the World Health Organization (WHO) itself congratulated Fujimori on his success in controlling demographic growth.<ref name=Diplo/>

On February 25, 1998, a representative for USAID testified before the U.S. government's [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Committee on International Relations]], to address controversy surrounding Peru's program. He indicated that the government of Peru was making important changes to the program, in order to:

* Discontinue their campaigns in tubal ligations and vasectomies.
* Make clear to health workers that there are no provider targets for voluntary surgical contraception or any other method of contraception.
* Implement a comprehensive monitoring program to ensure compliance with family planning norms and informed consent procedures.
* Welcome Ombudsman Office investigations of complaints received and respond to any additional complaints that are submitted as a result of the public request for any additional concerns.
* Implement a 72-hour "waiting period" for people who choose tubal ligation or vasectomy. This waiting period will occur between the second counseling session and surgery.
* Require health facilities to be certified as appropriate for performing surgical contraception as a means to ensure that no operations are done in makeshift or substandard facilities.<ref>{{cite web|title=USAID Testimony: House International Relations Committee, Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, 2/25/98|url=http://www.usaid.gov/press/spe_test/testimony/1998/test079.htm|publisher=USAID|access-date=August 23, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906034940/http://www.usaid.gov/press/spe_test/testimony/1998/test079.htm|archive-date=September 6, 2009}}</ref>

In September 2001, Minister of Health [[Luis Solari De La Fuente|Luis Solari]] launched a special commission into the activities of the voluntary surgical contraception, initiating a parliamentary commission tasked with inquiring into the "irregularities" of the program, and to put it on an acceptable footing. In July 2002, its final report ordered by the Minister of Health revealed that between 1995 and 2000, 331,600 women were sterilized, while 25,590 men submitted to vasectomies.<ref name="Diplo"/> The plan, which had the objective of diminishing the number of births in areas of poverty within Peru, was essentially directed at the indigenous people living in deprived areas (areas often involved in internal conflicts with the Peruvian government, as with the [[Shining Path]] guerilla group). Deputy Dora Núñez Dávila made the accusation in September 2003 that 400,000 indigenous people were sterilized during the 1990s. Documents proved that President Fujimori was informed, each month, of the number of sterilizations done, by his former Ministers of Health, Eduardo Yong Motta (1994–96), Marino Costa Bauer (1996–1999) and [[Alejandro Aguinaga]] (1999–2000).<ref name=Diplo/> A study by sociologist {{ill|Giulia Tamayo León|es}}, ''Nada Personal'' (in English: Nothing Personal), showed that doctors were required to meet quotas. According to ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', "tubal ligation festivals" were organized through program publicity campaigns, held in the ''[[pueblos jóvenes]]'' (in English: shantytowns). In 1996 there were, according to official statistics, 81,762 tubal ligations performed on women, with a peak being reached the following year, with 109,689 ligatures, then only 25,995 in 1998.<ref name="bbc" />

On October 21, 2011, Peru's Attorney General José Bardales decided to reopen an investigation into the cases, which had been halted in 2009 under the statute of limitations, after the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] ruled that President Fujimori's sterilization program involved crimes against humanity, which are not time-limited.<ref>[http://impunitywatch.com/?p=21794 Thousands of Forced Sterilization Cases Reopened in Peru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426235249/http://impunitywatch.com/?p=21794 |date=2014-04-26 }} Impunity Watch, published November 14, 2011</ref> It is unclear as to any progress in matter of the execution (debido ejecución sumaria) of the suspect in the course of any proof of their relevant accusations in the legal sphere of the constituted people in vindication of the rights of the people of South America.

The eugenistic legislation was enacted in 1934 and was formally abolished in 1976.

Compulsory sterilisation did not completely cease until 2012, because in that time transgender individuals were required to undergo it to change legal sex.

===Switzerland===
In October 1999, Margrith von Felten suggested to the [[National Council of Switzerland]] in the form of a general proposal to adopt legal regulations that would enable reparation for persons sterilized against their will. According to the proposal, reparation was to be provided to persons who had undergone the intervention without their consent or who had consented to sterilization under coercion.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} According to Margrith von Felten:
{{cquote|The history of eugenics in Switzerland remains insufficiently explored. Research programmes are in progress. However, individual studies and facts are already available. For example:

The report of the Institute for the History of Medicine and Public Health "Mental Disability and Sexuality. Legal sterilization in the [[Vaud]] Canton between 1928 and 1985" points out that coercive sterilizations took place until the 1980s, it is unclear if the ethnographic impact has been duly investigated and if Hun-descendant French have been affected, as well as prehistoric human descendant communities. The act on coercive sterilizations of the Vaud Canton was the first law of this kind in the European context.

Hans Wolfgang Maier, head of the Psychiatric Clinic in Zurich pointed out in a report from the beginning of the century that 70% to 80% of [[abortion|terminations]] were linked to sterilization by doctors. In the period from 1929 to 1931, 480 women and 15 men were sterilized in Zurich in connection with termination.

Following agreements between doctors and authorities such as the 1934 "Directive For Surgical Sterilization" of the Medical Association in Basle, eugenic indication to sterilization was recognized as admissible.

A statistical evaluation of the sterilizations performed in the Basle women's hospital between 1920 and 1934 shows a remarkable increase in sterilizations for a psychiatric indication after 1929 and a steep increase in 1934, when a coercive sterilization act came into effect in nearby National Socialist Germany.

A study by the Swiss Nursing School in Zurich, published in 1991, documents that 24 mentally disabled women aged between 17 and 25 years were sterilized between 1980 and 1987. Of these 24 sterilizations, just one took place at the young woman's request.

Having evaluated sources primarily from the 1930s (psychiatric files, official directives, court files, etc.), historians have documented that the requirement for free consent to sterilization was in most of cases not satisfied. Authorities obtained the "[[Informed consent|consent]]" required by the law partly by persuasion, and partly by enforcing it through coercion and threats. Thus the recipients of social benefits were threatened with removal of the benefits, women were exposed to a choice between placement in an institution or sterilization, and abortions were permitted only when women simultaneously consented to sterilization.

More than fifty years after ending the National Socialist dictatorship in Germany, in which racial murder, euthanasia and coerced sterilizations belonged to the political programme, it is clear that eugenics, with its idea of "[[life unworthy of life]]" and "racial purity" permeated even democratic countries. The idea that a "healthy nation" should be achieved through targeted medical/social measures was designed and politically implemented in many European countries and in the U.S.A in the first half of this century. It is a policy incomparable with the inconceivable horrors of the Nazi rule; yet it is clear that authorities and the medical community were guilty of the methods and measures applied, i.e. coerced sterilizations, prohibitions of marriages and child removals – serious violations of human rights.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}}}

Switzerland refused, however, to vote a reparations Act.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The United States During the [[Progressive era]], ca. 1890 to 1920, was the first country to concertedly undertake compulsory sterilization programs for the purpose of eugenics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Iredale | first1 = Rachel | year = 2000 | title = Eugenics And Its Relevance To Contemporary Health Care | journal = Nursing Ethics | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 205–14| doi = 10.1177/096973300000700303 | pmid = 10986944 | s2cid = 37888613 }}</ref> [[Thomas C.

Eugenics had two essential components. First, its advocates accepted as axiomatic that a range of mental and physical handicaps—blindness, deafness, and many forms of mental illness—were largely, if not entirely, hereditary in cause. Second, they assumed that these scientific hypotheses could be used as the basis of social engineering across several policy areas, including family planning, education, and immigration. The most direct policy implications of eugenic thought were that “mental defectives” should not produce children, since they would only replicate these deficiencies, and that such individuals from other countries should be kept out of the polity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hansen, King|first=Randall, Desmond|date=Summer 2017|title=Eugenic Ideas, Political Interests, and Policy Variance: Immigration and Sterilization Policy in Britain and the U.S|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248650104|journal=World Politics|volume=53|issue=2|pages=237–263|doi=10.1353/wp.2001.0003|pmid=18193564|s2cid=19634871|access-date=2018-09-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809053048/https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Randall_Hansen/publication/248650104_Eugenic_Ideas_Political_Interests_and_Policy_Variance_Immigration_and_Sterilization_Policy_in_Britain_and_the_US/links/5548bc640cf27c5000668062/Eugenic-Ideas-Political-Interests-and-Policy-Variance-Immigration-and-Sterilization-Policy-in-Britain-and-the-US.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-09|url-status=live}}</ref> The principal targets of the American sterilization programs were the intellectually disabled and the [[Mental illness|mentally ill]], but also targeted under many state laws were the deaf, the blind, people with epilepsy, and the physically deformed. While the claim was that the focus was mainly the mentally ill and disabled, the definition of this during that time was much different than today's. At this time, there were many women that were sent to institutions under the guise of being “[[feeble-minded]]" because they were promiscuous or became pregnant while unmarried.

Some sterilizations took place in [[Incarceration in the United States|prisons and other penal institutions]], targeting [[criminality]], but they were in the relative minority.<ref>Interview with [[Alexandra Stern|Alexandra Minna Stern]], Ph.D. of University of Michigan in Spanish newspaper [[El País]] published on 12 July 2013 [http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/12/actualidad/1373652806_358454.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715102459/http://sociedad.elpais.com/sociedad/2013/07/12/actualidad/1373652806_358454.html |date=2013-07-15 }}</ref> In the end, over 65,000 individuals were sterilized in 33 states under state compulsory sterilization programs in the United States, in all likelihood without the perspectives of ethnic minorities.<ref name="Open WorldCat">{{cite book|last=Kevles|first=Daniel|title=In the name of eugenics: Genetics and the uses of human heredity|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-394-50702-6|edition=1st|date=April 12, 1985}}</ref>

The first state to introduce a compulsory sterilization bill was [[Michigan]], in 1897, but the proposed law failed to pass. Eight years later [[Pennsylvania]]'s state legislators passed a sterilization bill that was vetoed by the governor.

After World War II, public opinion towards eugenics and sterilization programs became more negative in the light of the connection with the [[genocide|genocidal]] policies of [[Nazi Germany]], though a significant number of sterilizations continued in a few states through the 1970s. Between 1970–76, Indian Health Services sterilized between 25–42 percent of women of reproductive age who came in seeking healthcare services. In addition, the U.S. launched campaigns of sterilization against black women in the South and Latina women in the Southwest in order to break the chain of welfare dependency and curb the population rise of non-white citizens.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fit to Be Tied: Sterilization and Reproductive Rights in America, 1950–1980|last=Kluchin|first=Rebecca|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2009|location=Rutgers}}</ref><ref name=":7" /> In California, ten women who delivered their children at LAC-USC hospital between 1971-1974 and were sterilized without proper consent sued the hospital in the landmark ''[[Madrigal v.

Some states continued to have sterilization laws on the books for much longer after that, though they were rarely if ever used. California sterilized more than any other state by a wide margin, and was responsible for over a third of all sterilization operations. Information about the California sterilization program was produced into book form and widely disseminated by eugenicists [[E.S. Gosney]] and [[Paul B. Popenoe]], which was said by the government of Adolf Hitler to be of key importance in proving that large-scale compulsory sterilization programs were feasible.<ref>On California sterilizations and their connection to the Nazi program, see: Stefan Kühl, ''The Nazi connection: Eugenics, American racism, and German National Socialism'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994); Alexandra Stern, ''Eugenic nation: faults and frontiers of better breeding in modern America'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005); and Wendy Kline, ''Building a better race: gender, sexuality, and eugenics from the turn of the century to the baby boom'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001).</ref>
In recent years, the governors of many states have made public apologies for their past programs beginning with Virginia and followed by Oregon<ref name="oregonapology" /> and California. Few have offered to compensate those sterilized, however, citing that few are likely still living (and would of course have no affected offspring) and that inadequate records remain by which to verify them. At least one compensation case, ''[[Poe v. Lynchburg Training School & Hospital]]'' (1981), was filed in the courts on the grounds that the sterilization law was unconstitutional. It was rejected because the law was no longer in effect at the time of the filing. However, the petitioners were granted some compensation because the stipulations of the law itself, which required informing the patients about their operations, had not been carried out in many cases.

The Governor of Puerto Rico, Menendez Ramos, enacted Law 116,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stanford.edu/group/womenscourage/cgi-bin/blogs/familyplanning/2008/10/23/forced-sterilization-in-puerto-rico/|title=Forced Sterilization in Puerto Rico " Family Planning|website=stanford.edu|access-date=2017-07-25|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721113445/http://stanford.edu/group/womenscourage/cgi-bin/blogs/familyplanning/2008/10/23/forced-sterilization-in-puerto-rico/|archive-date=2017-07-21}}</ref> which went into effect on May 13, 1937.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stanford.edu/group/womenscourage/cgi-bin/blogs/familyplanning/2008/10/30/puerto-rico-revisited/|title=Puerto Rico Revisited " Family Planning|website=stanford.edu|access-date=2017-07-25|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208104209/http://stanford.edu/group/womenscourage/cgi-bin/blogs/familyplanning/2008/10/30/puerto-rico-revisited|archive-date=2016-12-08}}</ref> It was a [[birth control]] and eugenic sterilization law that allowed the dissemination of information regarding birth control methods and legalized the practice of birth control.<ref name="Mass" /><ref name="Nick" /> The government cited a growing population of the poor and unemployed as motivators for the law. Abortion remained heavily restricted. By 1965, approximately 34 percent of women of childbearing age had been sterilized, two thirds of whom were still in their early twenties. The law was repealed on June 8, 1960.<ref name="Mass" />

=====1940s–1950s=====

Unemployment and widespread poverty would continue to grow in Puerto Rico in the 40s, threatening both U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico and acting as a deterrent for future investment.<ref name="Mass" /> In an attempt to attract additional U.S. private investment in Puerto Rico, another round of liberalizing trade policies were implemented and referred to as “[[Operation Bootstrap]].”<ref name="Mass" /> Despite these policies and their relative success, unemployment and poverty in Puerto Rico remained high, high enough to prompt an increase in [[emigration]] from Puerto Rico to the United States between 1950 and 1955.<ref name="Mass" /> The issues of [[immigration]], Puerto Rican poverty, and threats to U.S. private investment made population control concerns a prime political and social issue for the United States.<ref name="Mass" />

The 50s also saw the production of social science research supporting sterilization procedures in Puerto Rico.<ref name="Mass" /> Princeton's [[Office of Population Research]], in collaboration with the Social Research Department at the University of Puerto Rico, conducted interviews with couples regarding sterilization and other birth control.<ref name="Mass" /> Their studies concluded that there was a significant need and desire for permanent birth control among Puerto Ricans.<ref name="Mass" /> In response, Puerto Rico's governor and Commissioner of health opened 160 private, temporary birth control clinics with the specific purpose of sterilization.<ref name="Mass" />

Also during this era, private birth control clinics were established in Puerto Rico with funds provided by wealthy Americans.<ref name="Mass" /><ref name="Nick" /> [[Joseph Sunnen]], a wealthy American Republican and industrialist, established the [[Sunnen Foundation]] in 1957.<ref name="Mass" /><ref name="Nick" /> The foundation funded new birth control clinics under the title “La Asociación Puertorriqueña el Biensestar de la Familia” and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in an experimental project to determine if a formulaic program could be used to control population growth in Puerto Rico and beyond.<ref name="Mass" />

=====Sterilization procedures and [[coercion]]=====
From beginning of the 1900s, U.S. and Puerto Rican governments espoused rhetoric connecting the poverty of Puerto Rico with overpopulation and the “hyper-fertility” of Puerto Ricans.<ref name=Lopez>{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=Iris|title=Agency And Constraint: Sterilization And Reproductive Freedom Among Puerto Rican Women In New York City|journal=Urban Anthropology and Studies of Cultural Systems and World Economic Development|date=1993|volume=22|issue=3}}</ref> Such rhetoric combined with eugenics ideology of reducing “population growth among a particular class or ethnic group because they are considered...a social burden,” was the philosophical basis for the 1937 birth control legislation enacted in Puerto Rico.<ref name= "Lopez" /><ref name="Briggs" /> A Puerto Rican Eugenics Board, modeled after a similar board in the United States, was created as part of the bill, and officially ordered ninety-seven involuntary sterilizations.<ref name=Briggs>{{cite book|last1=Briggs|first1=Laura|title=Reproducing Empire: Race, Sex, Science, and U.S. Imperialism in Puerto Rico|date=2002|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, California|isbn=978-0-520-22255-7}}</ref>

The legalization of sterilization was followed by a steady increase in the popularity of the procedure, both among the Puerto Rican population and among physicians working in Puerto Rico.<ref name="Briggs" /><ref name=B>{{cite book|last1=Ramirez de Arellano|first1=Annette B.|last2=Seipp|first2=Conrad|title=Colonialism, Catholicism, and Contraception: A History of Birth Control in Puerto Rico|date=1983|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-1544-1}}</ref> Though sterilization could be performed on men and women, women were most likely to undergo the procedure.<ref name="Mass" /><ref name="Nick" /><ref name="Briggs" /><ref name="B" /> Sterilization was most frequently recommended by physicians because of a pervasive belief that Puerto Ricans and the poor were not intelligent enough to use other forms of contraception.<ref name="Briggs" /><ref name="B" /> Physicians and hospitals alike also implemented hospital policy to encourage sterilization, with some hospitals refusing to admit healthy pregnant women for delivery unless they consented to be sterilized.<ref name="Briggs" /><ref name= "B" /> This has been best documented at Presbyterian Hospital, where the unofficial policy for a time was to refuse admittance for delivery to women who already had three living children unless she consented to sterilization.<ref name="Briggs" /><ref name="B" /> There is additional evidence that true [[informed consent]] was not obtained from patients before they underwent sterilization, if consent was solicited at all.<ref name="B" />

By 1949 a survey of Puerto Rican women found that 21% of women interviewed had been sterilized, with sterilizations being performed in 18% of all hospital births statewide as a routine post-partum procedure, with the sterilization operation performed before women left the hospitals after giving birth.<ref name="Mass" /> As for the birth control clinics founded by Sunnen, the Puerto Rican Family Planning Association reported that around 8,000 women and 3,000 men had been sterilized in Sunnen's privately funded clinics.<ref name="Mass" /> At one point, the levels of sterilization in Puerto Rico were so high that they alarmed the Joint Committee for Hospital Accreditation, who then demanded that Puerto Rican hospitals limit sterilizations to ten percent of all hospital deliveries in order to receive accreditation.<ref name="Mass" /> The high popularity of sterilization continued into the 60s and 70s, during which the Puerto Rican government made the procedures available for free and reduced fees.<ref name="Briggs" /> The effects of the sterilization and contraception campaigns of the 1900s in Puerto Rico are still felt in Puerto Rican cultural history today.<ref name= "Lopez" />

======Controversy and opposing viewpoints======
There has been much debate and scholarly analysis concerning the legitimacy of choice given to Puerto Rican women with regards to sterilization, reproduction, and birth control, as well as with the ethics of economically motivated mass sterilization programs.

Some scholars, such as Bonnie Mass<ref name="Mass" /> and Iris Lopez,<ref name= "Lopez" /> have argued that the history and popularity of mass sterilization in Puerto Rico represents a government-led eugenics initiative for [[population control]].,<ref name="Mass" /><ref name= "Lopez" /><ref name="B" /><ref name=Elena>{{cite journal|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Elena R.|last2=Fuentes|first2=Liza|title=Population Control by Sterilization: The Cases of Puerto Rican and Mexican-Origin Women in the United States|journal=Latino(a) Research Review|date=2009–2010|volume=7|issue=3}}</ref> They cite the private and government funding of sterilization, coercive practices, and the eugenics ideology of Puerto Rican and American governments and physicians as evidence of a mass sterilization campaign.<ref name= "Lopez" /><ref name="B" /><ref name= "Elena" />

On the other side of the debate, scholars like Laura Briggs<ref name="Briggs" /> have argued that evidence does not substantiate claims of a mass sterilization program.<ref name="Briggs" /> She further argues that reducing the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico to a state initiative ignores the legacy of Puerto Rican feminist activism in favor or birth control legalization and the individual agency of Puerto Rican women in making decisions about family planning.<ref name="Briggs" />

=====Effects=====
When the United States took census of Puerto Rico in 1899, the birth rate was 40 births per one thousand people.<ref name="Nick" /> By 1961, the birth rate had dropped to 30.8 per thousand.<ref name="Mass" /> In 1955, 16.5% of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized, this jumped to 34% in 1965.<ref name= "Mass" />

In 1969, sociologist [[Harriet Presser]] analyzed the 1965 Master Sample Survey of Health and Welfare in Puerto Rico.<ref name=Presser>{{cite journal|last1=Presser|first1=Harriet B.|title=The Role of Sterilization in Controlling Puerto Rican Fertility|journal=Population Studies|date=November 1969|volume=23|issue=3|pages=343–361|doi=10.2307/2172875|jstor=2172875|pmid=22073953}}<!--|accessdate=10 October 2014--></ref> She specifically analyzed data from the survey for women ages 20 to 49 who had at least one birth, resulting in an overall sample size of 1,071 women.<ref name="Presser" /> She found that over 34% of women aged 20–49 had been sterilized in Puerto Rico in 1965.<ref name="Presser" />

Presser's analysis also found that 46.7% of women who reported they were sterilized were between the ages of 34 and 39.<ref name="Presser" /> Of the sample of women sterilized, 46.6% had been married 15 to 19 years, 43.9% had been married for 10-to-14 years, and 42.7% had been married for 20-to-24 years.<ref name="Presser" /> Nearly 50% of women sterilized had three or four births.<ref name="Presser" /> Over 1/3 of women who reported being sterilized were sterilized in their twenties, with the average age of sterilization being 26.<ref name="Presser" />

A survey by a team of Americans in 1975 confirmed Presser's assessment that nearly 1/3 of Puerto Rican women of childbearing age had been sterilized.<ref name="Mass" /> As of 1977, Puerto Rico had the highest proportion of childbearing-aged persons sterilized in the world.<ref name="Mass" /> In 1993, [[ethnographic]] work done in New York by [[anthropologist]] Iris Lopez<ref name= "Lopez" /> showed that the history of sterilization continued to effect the lives of Puerto Rican women even after they immigrated to the United States and lived there for generations.<ref name= "Lopez" /> The history of the popularity of sterilization in Puerto Rico meant that Puerto Rican women living in America had high rates of female family members who had undergone sterilization, and it remained a highly popular form of birth control among Puerto Rican women living in New York.<ref name= "Lopez" />

===Mexico===
“Civil Society Organizations such as Balance, Promocion para el Desarrollo y Juventud, A.C., have received in the last years numerous testimonies of women living with HIV in which they inform that misinformation about the virus transmission has frequently lead to compulsory sterilization. Although there is enough evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions aimed to reduce mother-to-child transmission risks, there are records of HIV-positive women forced to undergo sterilization or have agreed to be sterilized without adequate and sufficient information about their options.”<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=El Estado como "aparato reproductor" de violencia contra las mujeres.

A [http://www.jiasociety.org/index.php/jias/article/view/19462/html report] made in El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua concluded that women living with HIV, and whose health providers knew about it at the time of pregnancy, were six times more likely to experience forced or coerced sterilization in those countries. In addition, most of these women reported that health providers told them that living with HIV cancelled their right to choose the number and spacing of the children they want to have as well as the right to choose the contraceptive method of their choice; provided misleading information about the consequences for their health and that of their children and denied them access to treatments that reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission in order to coerce them into sterilization.<ref>{{Cite book|title=El Estado como "aparato reproductor" de violencia contra las mujeres.

This happens even when the health norm [http://www.salud.gob.mx/unidades/cdi/nom/005ssa23.html NOM 005-SSA2-1993] states that family planning is "the right of everyone to decide freely, responsibly and in an informed way the number and spacing of their children and to obtain specialized information and proper services” and that “the exercise of this right is independent of gender, age, and social or legal status of persons".<ref name=":1" />
