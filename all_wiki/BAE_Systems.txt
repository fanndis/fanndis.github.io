British Aerospace was a civil and [[military aircraft]] manufacturer, as well as a provider of military land systems. The company had emerged from the massive consolidation of UK aircraft manufacturers since World War II. British Aerospace was formed on 29 April 1977 by the nationalisation and merger of The [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC), the [[Hawker Siddeley|Hawker Siddeley Group]] and [[Scottish Aviation]].<ref name="compcomm"/> Both BAC and Hawker Siddeley were themselves the result of various mergers and acquisitions.<ref name="lineage">{{cite web |url=http://production.investis.com/heritage/storage/lineage/?t=lineage |title=The BAE Systems Lineage (click on Air tab) |accessdate=13 September 2007 |work=BAE Systems Heritage |publisher=BAE Systems plc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421093532/http://production.investis.com/heritage/storage/lineage/?t=lineage |archive-date=21 April 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref><!-- Citation based on "Air" section of this url, requires "Air" tab to be clicked, unfortunately no way of automating this in link -->

Marconi Electronic Systems was the defence subsidiary of British engineering firm the [[General Electric Company]] (GEC), dealing largely in military [[system integrator|systems integration]], as well as naval and land systems. Marconi's heritage dates back to [[Guglielmo Marconi]]'s Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company, founded in 1897.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://production.investis.com/heritage/nonflash/timeline/1874_guglielmo_marconi/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421093519/http://production.investis.com/heritage/nonflash/timeline/1874_guglielmo_marconi/ |archivedate=21 April 2008 |title=1874 Guglielmo Marconi |accessdate=13 September 2007 |work=BAE Systems Heritage |publisher=BAE Systems plc}}</ref> GEC purchased [[English Electric]] (which included Marconi) in 1968 and thereafter used the Marconi brand for its defence businesses (as GEC-Marconi and later Marconi Electronic Systems). GEC's own defence heritage dates back to World War I, when its contribution to the war effort included radios and bulbs. World War II consolidated this position, as the company was involved in important technological advances, notably the [[cavity magnetron]] for [[radar]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.connected-earth.com/Galleries/Prideofownership/Economicfactors/Anewindustry/index.htm |title=A new industry |accessdate=12 September 2007 |work=connected-earth.com|quote=during the Second World War it developed the cavity magnetron for radar |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070503152859/http://www.connected-earth.com/Galleries/Prideofownership/Economicfactors/Anewindustry/index.htm |archivedate= 3 May 2007}}</ref> Between 1945 and 1999, GEC-Marconi/Marconi Electronic Systems became one of the world's most important [[defence contractor]]s.

===Formation===
The 1997 merger of American corporations [[Boeing]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]], which followed the forming of [[Lockheed Martin]], the world's largest defence contractor in 1995, increased the pressure on European defence companies to consolidate. In June 1997 British Aerospace Defence managing director [[John Weston (businessman)|John Weston]] commented "Europe... is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the U.S.".<ref>{{Cite news|first=Andrea|last=Rothman|author2=Landberg, Reed|title=Europe Defense Firms Feel Pressure to Unite|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970615&slug=2544541|work=The Seattle Times|date=15 June 1997|accessdate=12 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519105921/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970615&slug=2544541|archive-date=19 May 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity, a European Aerospace and Defence Company.<ref>{{cite news |title=Business: The Company File: Defence merger on the radar |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/130305.stm |work=BBC News |date=10 July 1998 |accessdate=15 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124122609/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/130305.stm |archive-date=24 November 2005 |url-status=live}}</ref>

As early as 1995 British Aerospace and the German aerospace and defence company [[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace]] (DASA) were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Adam |last=Jones|title=Europe cries foul as New BAe emerges |work=The Times |location=UK |date=20 January 1999}}</ref> The two companies envisaged including Aérospatiale, the other major European aerospace company, but only after its privatisation.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Pierre|last=Sparaco|author2=Morrocco, John D. |title=French Government Grapples With Aerospace Strategy |work=Aviation Week and Space Technology |publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies |date=30 June 1997}}</ref> The first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of Airbus from a consortium of British Aerospace, DASA, Aérospatiale and [[Construcciones Aeronáuticas|Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA]] into an integrated company; in this aim British Aerospace and DASA were united against the various objections of Aérospatiale.<ref name="BAeDASArelations">{{Cite news |first=Bernard |last=Gray |author2=Michael Skapinker  |title=Giant waiting in the wings: Bernard Gray and Michael Skapinker ask if Europe's defence industry can consolidate in time to challenge US dominance |work=Financial Times|date=24 June 1997|author2-link=Michael Skapinker}}</ref> As well as Airbus, British Aerospace and DASA were partners in the [[Panavia Tornado]] and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft projects. Merger discussions began between British Aerospace and DASA in July 1998, just as French participation became more likely with the announcement that Aérospatiale was to merge with [[Matra]] and emerge with a diluted French government shareholding.<ref>{{Cite news |title=BAe and Dasa discuss proposals for merger: Aerospace groups still have 'important issues to resolve'|work=Financial Times |page=1 |date=24 July 1998}}</ref> A merger was agreed between British Aerospace chairman [[Richard Evans (businessman)|Richard Evans]] and DASA CEO [[Jürgen E.

Meanwhile, GEC was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation. Reporting the appointment of George Simpson as GEC managing director in 1996, ''The Independent'' had said "some analysts believe that Mr Simpson's inside knowledge of BAe, a long-rumoured GEC bid target, was a key to his appointment. GEC favours forging a national 'champion' defence group with BAe to compete with the giant US organisations."<ref>{{Cite news |first=Russell|last=Hotten |title=GEC confirms Simpson job|work=The Independent |location=UK |publisher=Newspaper Pub |page=17|date=19 March 1996}}</ref> When GEC put MES up for sale on 22 December 1998, British Aerospace abandoned the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival.

Seventeen undertakings were given by BAE Systems to the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] which prevented a reference of the merger to the [[Monopolies and Mergers Commission]]. These were largely to ensure that the integrated company would tender sub-contracts to external companies on an equal basis with its subsidiaries. Another condition was the "[[Chinese wall|firewalling]]" of former British Aerospace and MES teams on defence projects such as the [[Joint Strike Fighter Program|Joint Strike Fighter]] (JSF). In 2007 the government announced it had agreed to release BAE Systems from ten of the undertakings due to "a change in circumstances".<ref>{{Cite news |title= UK.

===2000s===
BAE Systems' first annual report identified Airbus, support services to militaries and integrated systems for air, land and naval applications as key areas of growth. It also stated the company's desire to both expand in the US and participate in further consolidation in Europe. BAE Systems described 2001 as an "important year" for its European joint ventures, which were reorganised considerably. The company has described the rationale for expansion in the US; "[it] is by far the largest defence market with spend running close to twice that of the Western European nations combined. Importantly, US investment in research and development is significantly higher than in Western Europe."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://production.investis.com/investors/news/rp/rp2001/ar00/ar00.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127160425/http://production.investis.com/investors/news/rp/rp2001/ar00/ar00.pdf|archivedate=27 November 2007|title=BAE Systems 2000 Annual Report |accessdate=5 October 2007 |publisher=BAE Systems |page=6}}</ref> When [[Dick Olver]] was appointed chairman in July 2004 he ordered a review of the company's businesses which ruled out further European acquisitions or joint ventures and confirmed a "strategic bias" for expansion and investment in the US.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Peter |last=Spiegel|title=Oil or missiles, the constant is power|work=Financial Times|date=7 December 2004}}</ref> The review also confirmed the attractiveness of the land systems sector and, with two acquisitions in 2004 and 2005, BAE moved from a limited land systems supplier to the second largest such company in the world.

The UK government, following a cabinet row described as "one of the most bitter Cabinet disputes over defence contracts since the [[Westland affair|Westland helicopter affair]] in 1985", ordered 20 [[BAE Hawk]] trainer aircraft with 24 options in July 2003 in a deal worth £800&nbsp;million.<ref name="hawk03">{{Cite news |first=Michael |last=Evans|author2=Benett, Rosemary |title= Cabinet battle over British jet contract |work=The Times |location=UK |date=31 July 2003}}</ref> The deal was significant because it was a factor in India's decision to finalise a £1&nbsp;billion order for 66 Hawks in March 2004.<ref name="hawk03"/><ref>{{Cite news |first=Russell|last=Hotten|title= Protests loom over Hawk deal with India |work=The Times |location=UK|publisher=Times Newspapers |date=20 March 2004}}</ref> Also in July 2003 BAE Systems and [[Finmeccanica]] announced their intention to set up three joint venture companies, to be collectively known as [[Eurosystems]].

====Airbus shareholding====
{{main|Airbus}}

BAE Systems inherited British Aerospace's share of Airbus Industrie, which consisted of two factories at [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] and [[Filton]]. These facilities manufactured wings for the Airbus family of aircraft. In 2001 Airbus was incorporated as Airbus SAS, a [[Société par actions simplifiée|joint stock company]]. In return for a 20% share in the new company BAE Systems transferred ownership of its Airbus plants (known as [[Airbus UK]]) to the new company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/bae-reveals-39airbus-uk39-proposal-64872/|title=BAE reveals 'Airbus UK' proposal|date=25 April 2000|publisher=Flight Global|accessdate=25 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226032233/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/bae-reveals-39airbus-uk39-proposal-64872/|archive-date=26 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

After its creation, BAE Systems had a difficult relationship with the MoD. This was attributed to deficient project management by the company, but also in part to the deficiencies in the terms of "fixed price contracts". CEO [[Michael Turner (businessman)|Mike Turner]] said in 2006 "We had entered into contracts under the old competition rules that frankly we shouldn't have taken".<ref>{{Cite news |first= Angela |last= Jameson |title= BAE Systems chief reaps reward for years of fighting for revival |url= http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/engineering/article735302.ece |work= The Times |location= London |date= 27 February 2006 |accessdate= 9 November 2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110611171023/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/engineering/article735302.ece |archive-date= 11 June 2011 |url-status= live}}</ref> These competition rules were introduced by [[Peter Levene, Baron Levene of Portsoken|Lord Levene]] during the 1980s to shift the burden of risk to the contractor and were in contrast to "cost plus contracts" where a contractor was paid for the value of its product plus an agreed profit.<ref name="basic">{{cite web |url= http://www.basicint.org/pubs/Papers/BP50.pdf |title= The UK Defence Industrial Strategy and Alternative Approaches |accessdate=9 November 2006 |author=Dr Steven Schofield |date=March 2006 |work=Basic Papers: Occasional Papers on International Security Policy |page= 5 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061108211358/http://www.basicint.org/pubs/Papers/BP50.pdf |archivedate= 8 November 2006}}</ref>

BAE Systems was operating in "the only truly open defence market",<ref>{{Cite news |first= Graham |last= Warwick |title= Best of British; For years BAE Systems' identity was British, but with its investment in foreign markets increasing, change is just around the corner |work=Flight International |publisher=Reed Elsevier Inc. |page= 48 |date= 6 June 2004}}</ref> which meant that it was competing with US and European companies for British defence projects, while they were protected in their home markets. The US defence market is competitive, however largely between American firms, while foreign companies are excluded. In December 2005 the MoD published the Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) which has been widely acknowledged to recognise BAE Systems as the UK's "national champion".<ref name="econdis">{{Cite news |title= BAE Systems: Changing places |url= http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8091318 |work=The Economist |publisher=The Economist Newspaper |date= 26 October 2006 |accessdate=9 November 2006 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061115211145/http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8091318 |archivedate= 15 November 2006 |url-status= live}}</ref> The DIS identifies key industrial capabilities which must be maintained within the UK through long-term government commitments to support research spending and procurement. Of these capabilities, several are dominated by BAE Systems, including naval vessels and submarines, combat vehicles, fixed-wing aircraft, general munitions (with the exception of certain "niche capabilities abroad") and [[network-enabled capability]] (defined as C4ISTAR in the DIS). The company maintains an interest in future UAV technologies through its collaborative FLAVIIR research programme with [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flaviir.com/home.htm |title=The FLAVIIR project |publisher=Flaviir.com |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711005454/http://www.flaviir.com/home.htm |archivedate=11 July 2011}}</ref>

After the publication of the DIS BAE Systems CEO Mike Turner said "If we didn't have the DIS and our profitability and the terms of trade had stayed as they were... then there had to be a question mark about our future in the UK".<ref>{{Cite news|first=Douglas |last=Barrie |title=British Defense Industrial Strategy Secures BAE Systems as UK.

==Corporate governance==
BAE Systems' chairman is Sir [[Roger Carr (businessman)|Roger Carr]]. The executive directors are [[Charles Woodburn]] (CEO), Peter Lynas and Jerry DeMuro. The non-executive directors are [[Harriet Green]], [[Chris Grigg]], Nick Rose, Paula Rosput Reynolds, Ian Tyler, Revathi Advaithi and [[Elizabeth Corley]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baesystems.com/en/our-company/our-people/board-of-directors |title=Board of Directors |accessdate=2 November 2018 |publisher=BAE Systems plc |year=2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103230620/https://www.baesystems.com/en/our-company/our-people/board-of-directors |archive-date=3 November 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The company's first CEO, John Weston, was forced to resign in 2002 in a boardroom "coup" and was replaced by Mike Turner.<ref>{{Cite news |first= Richard |last= Wachman |title= A very British coup at BAE |url= https://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/mar/31/theobserver.observerbusiness9 |work= The Observer |location= London |publisher= Guardian Newspapers |date= 21 March 2002 |accessdate= 27 October 2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140613065458/http://www.theguardian.com/business/2002/mar/31/theobserver.observerbusiness9 |archive-date= 13 June 2014 |url-status= live}}</ref> ''The Business'' reported that Weston was ousted when non-executive directors informed the chairman that they had lost confidence in him. Further, it was suggested that at least one non-executive director was encouraged to make such a move by the MOD due to the increasingly fractious relationship between BAE Systems and the government.<ref name="Business">{{Cite news |first=Ian|last= Watson|title=Weston is blown away in shootout at Dukes Hotel|work=The Business|publisher=Sunday Business Group|page=10|date=7 April 2002}}</ref> As well as the terms of the Nimrod contract, Weston had fought against the MOD's insistence that one of the first three Type 45 destroyers should be built by VT Group.

It is understood that Turner had a poor working relationship with senior MOD officials, for example with former Defence Secretary [[Geoff Hoon]].

===Espionage===

In September 2003 ''The Sunday Times'' reported that BAE Systems had hired a private security contractor to collate information about individuals working at the [[Campaign Against Arms Trade]] and their activities.<ref>{{Cite news |title= How the woman at No 27 ran spy network for an arms firm |work=The Sunday Times |location=UK |publisher=Times Newspapers |page= 10 |date= 28 September 2003 <!--|accessdate=28 November 2006-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |first=Mark |last=Thomas |title=Martin and me |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/04/bae.armstrade |work=The Guardian |location=London |publisher=Guardian Newspapers |date=4 December 2007 |accessdate=4 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901074033/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/04/bae.armstrade |archive-date=1 September 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> In February 2007, it was reported that the corporation had again obtained private confidential information from CAAT.<ref>{{Cite news |first=George |last=Monbiot |title=The parallel universe of BAE: covert, dangerous and beyond the rule of law |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/13/bae.foreignpolicy |work=The Guardian |location=London |publisher=Guardian Newspapers |date=13 February 2007 |accessdate=4 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831013507/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/13/bae.foreignpolicy |archive-date=31 August 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The company was reported in 2012 to have been the target of Chinese [[cyber espionage]] that may have stolen secrets related to the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/security-experts-admit-china-stole-secret-fighter-jet-plans/story-fnb64oi6-1226296400154 |title=Security experts admit China stole secret fighter jet plans |work=theaustralian.com.au |publisher=The Australian |date=12 March 2012 |access-date=11 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311221825/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/security-experts-admit-china-stole-secret-fighter-jet-plans/story-fnb64oi6-1226296400154 |archive-date=11 March 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Nuclear weapons===
In 2006, BAE Systems was excluded from the [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] of the [[The Government Pension Fund of Norway|government pension fund of Norway]] "because they develop and/or produce central components for nuclear weapons".<ref name= 'Norway'/> "According to the ethical guidelines for the [Norwegian] Government Pension Fund – Global, companies that produce weapons that through normal use may violate fundamental [[humanitarian principles]] shall be excluded from the fund."<ref name= 'Norway'>{{Cite press release |title=Exclusions from the Government Pension Fund – Global |publisher=Norway Ministry of Finance |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/fin/press-center/Press-releases/2006/Exclusions-from-the-Government-Pension-F.html?id=419804&epslanguage=EN-GB |accessdate=7 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418001442/http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/fin/Press-Center/Press-releases/2006/Exclusions-from-the-Government-Pension-F.html?id=419804&epslanguage=EN-GB |archive-date=18 April 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> BAE Systems is indirectly engaged in production of [[nuclear weapons]] – through its 37.5% share of [[MBDA]] it is involved with the production and support of the [[Air-Sol Moyenne Portée|ASMP]] missile, an air-launched nuclear missile which forms part of the [[Force de frappe|French nuclear deterrent]]. The company is also the UK's only [[nuclear submarine]] manufacturer and thus produces a key element of the United Kingdom's nuclear weapons capability.  However, commentators pointed out Norway has bound their strategic defence to the UK's "since Napoleonic times", including both protection under the British nuclear deterrent as well as the joint NATO nuclear sharing policy.<ref>{{cite news| last=Kiley| first=Sam| title=Britain Is Best Staying in EU, Says Norway| url=http://news.sky.com/story/1504911/britain-is-best-staying-in-eu-says-norway| date=19 June 2015| newspaper=Sky News| accessdate=19 June 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619175436/http://news.sky.com/story/1504911/britain-is-best-staying-in-eu-says-norway| archive-date=19 June 2015| url-status=live}}</ref>

===Cluster bombs===
BAE Systems was in 2003 initially criticised for its role in the production of [[cluster bombs]], due to the long term risk for injury or death to civilians. Following the 2008 Oslo [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]] BAE Systems was among the first defence contractors to stop their manufacture<ref>{{cite news| title=Do you make or sell cluster munitions?| url=http://www.baesystems.com/article/BAES_052468/cluster-bombs?_afrLoop=2997644007578000&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null#!%40%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D2997644007578000%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dwzijqwb8e_370| newspaper=BAE Systems| accessdate=19 June 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619174023/http://www.baesystems.com/article/BAES_052468/cluster-bombs?_afrLoop=2997644007578000&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null#!%40%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D2997644007578000%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dwzijqwb8e_370| archive-date=19 June 2015| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baesystems.com/BAEProd/groups/public/documents/bae_publication/bae_pdf_cr08_cr_panel.pdf |title=Corporate Responsibility Panel |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611075402/http://www.baesystems.com/BAEProd/groups/public/documents/bae_publication/bae_pdf_cr08_cr_panel.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2011}}</ref> and by 2012 the majority of the munitions had been destroyed.<ref>{{cite news| last=Norton-Taylor| first=Richard| title=Most of Britain's cluster bomb stockpile has been destroyed, say activists| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/britain-cluster-bomb-stockpile-destroyed| date=6 September 2012| accessdate=19 June 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619175230/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/britain-cluster-bomb-stockpile-destroyed| archive-date=19 June 2015| url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Political influence ===
Former Foreign Secretary [[Robin Cook]] said of his time in office that he "came to learn that the chairman of BAE appeared to have the key to the garden door to [[10 Downing Street|number 10]]. Certainly I never knew No 10 to come up with any decision which would be incommoding to BAE."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/the-firm-with-a-back-door-key-to-number-10-1796377.html |title=The firm with a 'back door key to Number 10' |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=2 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407053440/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/the-firm-with-a-back-door-key-to-number-10-1796377.html |archive-date=7 April 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> As well as employing in-house lobbyists, BAE Systems also employs a lobbying agency called [[Portland Communications|Portland PR]];<ref>{{cite web |url=https://registerofconsultantlobbyists.force.com/CLR_Client_Profile?Id=a082400000CyYQxAAN |title=Office for the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists |publisher=Registerofconsultantlobbyists.force.com |date=1 January 1990 |accessdate=2 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202215711/https://registerofconsultantlobbyists.force.com/CLR_Client_Profile?Id=a082400000CyYQxAAN |archive-date=2 February 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> many of Portland PR's staff have worked at the upper echelons of both Labour and Conservative governments.<ref>{{cite web |author=To Top |url=http://portland-communications.com/our-people/leadership-team |title=Leadership Team |publisher=Portland-communications.com |accessdate=2 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404011732/https://portland-communications.com/our-people/leadership-team/ |archive-date=4 April 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>
