'''Sonning''' is a village and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in [[Berkshire]], England, on the [[River Thames]], east of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. The village was described by [[Jerome K. Jerome]] in his book ''[[Three Men in a Boat]]'' as "the most fairy-like little nook on the whole river".

==Geography==
The parish of Sonning originally included [[Charvil]], [[Woodley, Berkshire|Woodley]] and [[Earley]] and, before the formation of civil parishes in 1866, was a cross-county-boundary parish containing [[Sonning Eye]], [[Dunsden Green]] and [[Playhatch]] in Oxfordshire as well. It is now much smaller and triangular shaped. The ecclesiastical parish of Sonning continues to include Sonning, Charvil and Sonning Eye.

The northwestern boundary is formed by the River Thames before passing through the middle of the [[Thames Valley Park]]. The southern border follows the railway line. The northeastern boundary travels over Charvil Hill and follows the edge of the housing at Charvil itself until it reaches the confluence of [[St Patrick's Stream]] with the Thames, near St Patrick's Bridge. The northern corner of the parish consists of very low-lying land adjoining the River. The Sonning Golf Course sits in the southeast corner, with [[Holme Park]], [[Sonning Hill]] and the business park in the southwest, and the village roughly in the middle.

Sonning village is at a crossing point of the [[River Thames]], where the narrow arched [[Sonning Bridge]] on the B478 crosses the river to the hamlet of Sonning Eye on the Oxfordshire bank. Just upstream of the bridge is [[Sonning Lock]]. The old village is now joined to further housing along Pound Lane and the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4 Bath Road]]. It lies some four miles east of the major town of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. In other directions, this would put it within the Reading suburban sprawl, but Sonning remains a clearly delineated small village. Most of the village together with the grounds of [[Reading Blue Coat School]] forms a [[Conservation Area]].<ref name="conservation-area">{{cite web| url=http://www.sonning.org.uk/docs/SonningCAA2017.pdf | title=Sonning Conservation Area Appraisal 2017 | date=2017 | location=UK | publisher=[[Wokingham Borough Council]] | accessdate=6 June 2017 }}</ref>

==Transport==
:''See also [[Sonning Lock]]''
The main road through Sonning is the B478, running from the Bridge to the Charvil roundabout on the A4. The B4446 runs north from the A4 to the village. The A4 itself passes through the south of the parish, as does the main Reading to [[Paddington Station|Paddington]] railway line, though there is no station. On the Thames, there are moorings at Sonning, both above and below the lock, as well as in the weir stream.

==Local government==
Sonning is a [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] with an elected parish council of nine councillors. It falls within the area of the [[unitary authority]] of [[Wokingham (district)|Wokingham]]. The parish council and the unitary authority are responsible for different aspects of local government.

===Twinning===
Sonning is twinned with [[Ligugé]], France.<ref name="Archant twinning">{{cite web|url=http://www.completefrance.com/language-culture/twin-towns|title=British towns twinned with French towns|accessdate = 11 July 2013|work=Archant Community Media Ltd}}</ref> The village has an active ''[[Town twinning|Twinning]] Association'' and the lane to the village primary school is called Ligugé Way.

==Toponomy==
The place-name Sonning seems to contain an [[Old English]]  personal name, ''Sunna'',   + '' ingas'' (Old English),  'The village of the people of . . .' ; 'the village of the people called after . . .', so probably, 'homestead/village of Sunna's people'.<ref>M. Gelling ''The Place Names of Berkshire'', 3 parts  (Cambridge, 1973-6),  i. pp.132-4, iii. pp.843-4;  A.D.Mills, ''Dictionary of English Place-Names'' (Oxford, 2002), p.428;  E.Ekwall, ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'' (Oxford, 1960), p.431;  V.Watts, ''Cambridge dictionary of English place-names'', (Cambridge,2004), p.560</ref> Sonning appears in the [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] survey of 1086 as ''Soninges''.<ref>National Archives: E 31/2/1/1677</ref>

==History==
[[File:Sonning Bridge - 1799.jpg|thumb|Print of [[Sonning Bridge]] (1799) with the tower of [[St Andrew's Church, Sonning]], in the background.]]
The historical name of the village is '''Sunning''', derived from the name of the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''[[Sunna (Saxon chief)|Sunna]]''.<ref>[http://www.berkshirehistory.com/villages/sonning.html Sonning], [http://www.berkshirehistory.com/ Royal Berkshire History].</ref> Older, more traditional villagers still pronounce the name of the village in this way and the spelling can be found on old maps and documents. In [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon times]], the village was of considerable importance as the lesser centre of the [[Bishop of Ramsbury (ancient)|bishopric of Ramsbury]], sometimes called the [[see of Ramsbury and Sonning]]. The church was a secondary cathedral and the present structure, [[St Andrew's Church, Sonning|St Andrew's Church]], contains reused [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] carvings.

By the 12th century Sonning church had eight dependent churches, four of which had become independent parishes by the 15th century.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nigel|last=Pounds|title=A history of the English parish|url=https://archive.org/details/historyenglishpa00poun|url-access=limited|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyenglishpa00poun/page/n49 22]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000}}</ref> This is an example of the organisation of the Anglo-Saxon church into minsters with their own parochially known as the [[Minster hypothesis|minster system]].

Sonning prospered as an important stopping post for travellers, both by road and by boat. There were a number of ancient hostelries where they could have stayed, notably the [[Great House at Sonning|Great House]] on the site of the original ferryman's cottage. The [[Bull Inn, Sonning|Bull Inn]] had the added bonus of being near the church where [[pilgrim]]s could venerate a [[relic]] of [[Saint Cyriacus]]. The [[Bishop of Salisbury|Bishops of Salisbury]] succeeded those of Ramsbury and Sonning and had a [[Sonning Bishop's Palace|Bishop's Palace]] in the village until the 16th century. [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]]'s young bride, Queen [[Isabella of Valois]], was kept captive here during his imprisonment and deposition.

Aberlash House is a [[Grade II listed]] house situated on an island in the River Thames at Sonning. It was originally built in the 17th century and formerly owned by the [[Rich baronets|Rich family]], Lords of the Manor of Sonning.

The [[Great Western Railway]] passes about half a mile south of the village, in a two-mile long cutting, [[Sonning Cutting]]. It was opened in 1840, and was the scene of [[Railway accident at Sonning Cutting|one of the first railway disasters]] in 1841, when a goods train ran into a landslip. Nine passengers died in the accident, being thrown from the open trucks just behind the engine. Many were stonemasons working on the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]], and the disaster led to changes in the [[Railway Regulation Act 1844|Railways Act]], which required that third-class passengers be carried in stoutly constructed carriages rather than open trucks. The Act also created [[Parliamentary train]]s for third-class passengers.

Just outside the village, above [[Sonning Lock]], is the independent secondary school, [[Reading Blue Coat School]], in the 19th century [[manor house]], [[Holme Park]]. Built in the 'Home Park' of the old palace, it replaced a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[mansion]] erected for the [[Lord of the Manor|Lords of the Manor]] who eventually superseded the bishops. The first of these was [[Laurence Halstead]], partner to the Reading [[cloth merchant]], [[John Kendrick (cloth merchant)|John Kendrick]].

In the early 20th century, a second [[country house]] was built in the village, the [[Deanery Garden|Deanery]]. It provides a fine example of an [[Edwin Lutyens]] house with a [[Gertrude Jekyll]] garden, originally designed as a show house for the founder of ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine.
