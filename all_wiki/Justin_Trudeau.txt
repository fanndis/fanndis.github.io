In the [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 federal election]], he was elected to represent the riding of [[Papineau (electoral district)|Papineau]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. In 2009, he was appointed the Liberal Party's [[Shadow Cabinet|critic]] for youth and multiculturalism, and the following year, became critic for citizenship and immigration. In 2011, he was appointed as a critic for secondary education and sport. Trudeau won the [[2013 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election|leadership of the Liberal Party]] in April 2013 and led his party to victory in the [[2015 Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]], moving the third-placed Liberals from 36 seats to 184 seats, the largest-ever numerical increase by a party in a Canadian federal election.<ref>{{cite book|title=Canada 2017-2018|series=World Today (Stryker)|last=Thompson|first=Wayne C.|page=149|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4758-3511-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-historical-trudeau-government-1.3344130|title=Size of Justin Trudeau's government breaks records, for better and worse|first=Éric|last=Grenier|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|work=CBC News|accessdate=October 23, 2019|date=December 2, 2015}}</ref> As Prime Minister, major government initiatives he undertook during his first term include legalizing recreational marijuana through the [[Cannabis Act]]; attempting Senate appointment reform by establishing the [[Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments]] and establishing the [[Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act|federal carbon tax]]; while grappling with ethics investigations concerning the [[Premiership of Justin Trudeau#Aga Khan|Aga Khan scandal]] and later, the [[SNC-Lavalin affair]].

Polls conducted during the leadership race showed that support for the Liberals would surge if they were led by Trudeau. Days after winning his party's leadership a poll showed that the Liberal Party was the choice of 43 per cent of respondents. This compared to 30 per cent for the governing Conservatives and 19 per cent for the Official Opposition New Democrats.<ref>{{cite news|title=Poll shows Justin Trudeau Liberals far ahead 38|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/04/16/poll-shows-justin-trudeau-liberals-far-ahead|accessdate=April 21, 2013|newspaper=Toronto Sun|date=April 16, 2013}}</ref>

According to an October 2013 [[Ekos Research Associates|EKOS]] poll, Trudeau's approval numbers improved to a 48–29 approval–disapproval; [[Thomas Mulcair]]'s jumped to a slight lead at 50–25, while Stephen Harper's ratings sank to 24–69.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ekospolitics.com/index.php/2013/10/stephen-harper-plumbing-record-lows-on-trust-direction-and-approval |title=Stephen Harper Plumbing Record Lows on Trust, Direction, and Approval |publisher=ekospolitics.com |accessdate=October 19, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923234726/http://www.ekospolitics.com/index.php/2013/10/stephen-harper-plumbing-record-lows-on-trust-direction-and-approval/ |archivedate=September 23, 2015}}</ref>

In 2013, Justin Trudeau chose to give up his seat at the [[Death and state funeral of Nelson Mandela|funeral of Nelson Mandela]], in deference to [[Irwin Cotler]] as representative of the [[Liberal Party of Canada]], because of Cotler's work for and with [[Nelson Mandela]] in fighting [[apartheid]].<ref>CTV News Network, "Memorial of Nelson Mandela", December 10, 2013.</ref>

During the leadership campaign Trudeau pledged to park all his assets, exclusive of real estate holdings, into a [[blind trust]] which is atypical for opposition MPs, including leaders. According to documents obtained by the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', he fulfilled the pledge in July 2013 when the blind trust was set up by [[Bank of Montreal|BMO Private Banking]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://o.canada.com/news/justin-trudeau-moves-personal-investments-into-blind-trust |title=Justin Trudeau voluntarily moves personal investments into blind trust, fulfilling campaign promise |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |last=McGregor |first=Glen |date=August 1, 2013 |accessdate=November 10, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026132921/http://o.canada.com/news/justin-trudeau-moves-personal-investments-into-blind-trust |archivedate=October 26, 2015}}</ref>

===2015 federal election===
{{Main|Canadian federal election, 2015}}
[[File:Justin Trudeau at the Vancouver LGBTQ Pride 2015.jpg|thumb|Trudeau at the [[Vancouver Pride Festival]], shortly after launching his election campaign]]
On October 19, 2015, after the longest official campaign in over a century, Trudeau led the Liberals to a decisive victory in the [[2015 Canadian federal election|federal election]]. The Liberals won 184 of the 338 seats, with 39.5% of the popular vote, for a strong majority government;<ref name="cbc.ca">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/results-2015/ |title=Election results |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=October 23, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022233012/http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/results-2015/ |archivedate=October 22, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://enr.elections.ca/National.aspx?lang=e |title=Election Night Results – National |author=2013 – Élections Canada |work=elections.ca |accessdate=October 23, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023060206/http://enr.elections.ca/National.aspx?lang=e |archivedate=October 23, 2015 }}</ref> a gain of 150 seats compared to the 2011 federal election.<ref name="cbc.ca"/>

This was the second-best performance in the party's history. The Liberals won mostly on the strength of a solid performance in the eastern half of the country. In addition to taking all of Atlantic Canada and Toronto,<ref name="cbc.ca"/> they won 40 seats in Quebec—the most that the Liberals had won in that province since Trudeau's father led them to a near-sweep of the province in 1980, and also the first time since then that the Liberals won a majority of Quebec's seats in an election. The 150-seat gain was the biggest numerical increase for a single party since Confederation and marked the first time that a party had rebounded from third place in the Commons to a majority government.

In addition to the appeal of his party's platform, Trudeau's success has been credited to his performance both on the campaign trail and televised [[Canadian leaders' debates|leaders' debates]] exceeding the lowered expectations created by Conservative advertisements and conservative media outlets.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Campbell |first1=Bradley |title=Stephen Harper underestimated Justin Trudeau, but it was the mocking way he did it that cost him the election |url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-10-20/stephen-harper-underestimated-justin-trudeau-it-was-mocking-way-he-did-it-cost |accessdate=October 21, 2015 |work=PRI |date=October 20, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021203300/http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-10-20/stephen-harper-underestimated-justin-trudeau-it-was-mocking-way-he-did-it-cost |archivedate=October 21, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hamilton |first1=Graeme |title=Graeme Hamilton: Justin Trudeau's stunning victory for the Liberals should finally silence his doubters |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/graeme-hamilton-justin-trudeau-emerges-victorious-from-an-election-campaign-that-should-finally-silence-his-doubters |accessdate=October 21, 2015 |work=National Post |date=October 20, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20151119122258/http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/graeme-hamilton-justin-trudeau-emerges-victorious-from-an-election-campaign-that-should-finally-silence-his-doubters |archivedate=November 19, 2015  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Gagnon |first1=Michelle |title=Justin Trudeau's rise shows the benefits of being underestimated |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-justin-trudeau-michelle-gagnon-1.3259553 |accessdate=October 21, 2015 |publisher=CBC News |date=October 7, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029081255/http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-justin-trudeau-michelle-gagnon-1.3259553 |archivedate=October 29, 2015}}</ref>
