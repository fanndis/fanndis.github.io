==Career==
===Film performances===
[[File:Knives Out 04 (48810268096).jpg|thumb|left|150px| Curtis at 2019 premiere of [[Knives Out]]]]
Curtis's film debut occurred in the 1978 horror film ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', in which she played the role of [[Laurie Strode]]. The film was a major success and was considered the highest-grossing [[independent film]] of its time, earning accolades as a classic horror film. Curtis was subsequently cast in several horror films, garnering her the title "[[scream queen]]".

Her next film was ''[[The Fog]]'', which was helmed by ''Halloween'' director [[John Carpenter]]. The horror film opened in February 1980 to mixed reviews but strong box office,<ref name="foggross">{{cite web | title=''The Fog'' gross tally | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=fog.htm | website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=March 9, 2006}}</ref> starting Curtis as a horror film starlet. Her next film, ''[[Prom Night (1980 film)|Prom Night]]'', was a low-budget Canadian [[slasher film]] released in July 1980. The film, for which she earned a [[Genie Award]] nomination for Best Performance by a Foreign Actress, was similar in style to ''Halloween'', yet received negative reviews which marked it as a disposable entry in the then-popular slasher genre. That year, Curtis also starred in ''[[Terror Train]]'', which opened in October and met with negative reviews akin to ''Prom Night''. Both films performed moderately well at the box office.<ref name="promgross">{{cite web | title=The Numbers Jamie Lee Curtis grosses | url=http://www.the-numbers.com/people/JLCUR.html | accessdate=March 9, 2006}}</ref>

Curtis had a similar function in both films—the main character whose friends are murdered and is practically the only [[protagonist]] to survive. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]], who gave negative reviews to all three of Curtis's 1980 films, said that Curtis "is to the current horror film glut what [[Christopher Lee]] was to the last one—or [[Boris Karloff]] was in the 1930s."<ref name="ebert">{{cite news | author = Roger Ebert | authorlink = Roger Ebert | title= Terror Train | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19801009/REVIEWS/10090301/1023 | date = October 9, 1980 | accessdate=March 9, 2006 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Curtis has returned to the ''Halloween'' series five times, playing Laurie Strode again in the sequels ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981), ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998), ''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]'' (2002), and ''[[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween]]'' (2018), and having an uncredited voice role in ''[[Halloween III: Season of the Witch]]'' (1982).

Her role in 1983's ''[[Trading Places]]'' helped Curtis shed her horror queen image, and garnered her a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role]].<ref name="BAFTACurtis">{{Cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1984/film/supporting-actress|title=BAFTA award Supporting Actress in 1984|publisher=[[BAFTA]] Awards|accessdate=August 29, 2015}}</ref> She then starred in the 1988 comedy film ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'', which achieved [[cult]] status while showcasing her as a comedic actress.

She also received a [[Golden Globe Award]] for her work in the 1994 action comedy film ''[[True Lies]]'', directed by [[James Cameron]]. 

Her other film roles also include the coming-of-age films ''[[My Girl (film)|My Girl]]'' (1991) and ''[[My Girl 2]]'' (1994), and the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] comedy film ''[[Freaky Friday (2003 film)|Freaky Friday]]'' (2003), opposite [[Lindsay Lohan]]. The latter was filmed at [[Palisades Charter High School|Palisades High School]] in [[Pacific Palisades, California]], near where Curtis and Guest lived with their children. She was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]] for her performance in the film.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/goldenglobes/2003-12-18-nomination-list_x.htm "Complete list of nominees for 61st Annual Golden Globe Awards"].

She returned to acting after being cast in June 2007 in Disney's [[live-action]]-[[animation|animated]] film ''[[Beverly Hills Chihuahua]]'', co-starring opposite [[Piper Perabo]] as one of three live-action characters in the film.
