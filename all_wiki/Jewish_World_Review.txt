'''''Jewish World Review''''' is a free, online magazine updated Monday through Friday (except for [[legal holiday]]s and [[Jewish holiday|holy days]]), which seeks to appeal to "people of faith and those interested in learning more about contemporary [[Judaism]] from Jews who take their religion seriously."

It carries informational articles related to Judaism, dozens of syndicated columns written mostly by politically [[Conservatism|conservative]] writers, both Jewish and [[Gentile]], [[advice column]]s on a number of issues, and cartoons.<ref name="jwr">[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0600/about1.asp "About JWR"], "Jewish World Review", access date August 9, 2009.</ref>

The founder and editor-in-chief, [[Binyamin L. Jolkovsky]], is a [[Rabbinical academy|rabbinical school]] graduate<ref name="dreher">Dreher, Rod.[http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=95001772 "World on a Shoestring: What is the fate of the Jewish World Review?"], WSJ Opinion Archives, January 25, 2002.</ref> and a former correspondent for ''[[Yated Ne'eman (Israel)|Yated Ne'eman]]'', an Israeli daily.<ref name="Jolkovsky">[[Binyamin L. Jolkovsky|Jolkovsky, Binyamin L.]] [http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=105001724 "Mideast Mayhem:Give War a Chance"], [[Wall Street Journal]] Opinion Archives, March 5, 2002.</ref> 

Although the magazine is written to appeal to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], Jolkovsky said he seeks a broader readership because "there are a lot of Christians who live Jewish values better than some Jews."<ref name="dreher"/> Regarding his magazine's political orientation, he said: "It is hard to understand a religious person who votes [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]... [[Maimonides]], the great Jewish philosopher, said there are ten levels of charity, [[tzedakah]]. The highest level is making a person self-sufficient, which sounds like what the [[Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] wants to do."<ref name="d'agostino">D'Agostino, Joseph A.[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_200104/ai_n8940917 "Conservative spotlight: Binyamin L Jolkovsky" /'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214054725/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_200104/ai_n8940917/|date=December 14, 2009}}, Human Events, April 9, 2001.</ref>
