The '''Republican National Committee''' ('''RNC''') is a U.S. [[Political action committee|political committee]] that leads the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party of the United States]]. It is responsible for developing and promoting the Republican [[political platform]], as well as coordinating [[fundraising]] and election strategy. It is also responsible for organizing and running the [[Republican National Convention]]. Similar committees exist in every [[U.S. state]] and most [[County (United States)|U.S. counties]], although in some states party organization is structured by [[List of United States congressional districts|congressional district]], allied campaign organizations being governed by a national committee. [[Ronna McDaniel]] is the current committee chairwoman.<ref>[https://gop.com/leaders/national/ National leaders - GOP.com]</ref>

The RNC's main counterpart is the [[Democratic National Committee]].

==History==
The [[1856 Republican National Convention]] appointed the first RNC. It consisted of one member from each state and territory to serve for four years. Each national committee since then has followed the precedent of equal representation for each state or territory, regardless of population. From 1924 to 1952, there was a national committeeman and national committeewoman from each state and U.S. possession, and from [[Washington, D.C.]]. In 1952, committee membership was expanded to include the state party chairs of states that voted Republican in the preceding presidential election, have a Republican majority in their congressional delegation (U.S. representatives and senators), or have Republican governors. By 1968, membership reached 145. As of 2011, the RNC has 168 members.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/01/14/despite-priebus-lead-rnc-election-highly-contested/ Fox News.com]</ref>

The only person to have chaired the RNC and later become U.S. president is [[George H. W. Bush]]. A number of the chairs of the RNC have been state governors.

In 2013, the RNC began an outreach campaign toward American youth and minority voters, after studies showed these groups generally perceived that the Republican Party did not care about their concerns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/video/campaign/288661-rnc-drastic-changes-needed-if-gop-hopes-to-remain-competitive |title=RNC: 'Drastic changes' needed if party hopes to remain competitive |first1=Cameron |last1=Joseph |first2=Jonathan |last2=Easley |work=The Hill |date=March 18, 2013 |access-date=March 18, 2013 }}</ref>

On announcing his candidacy to succeed RNC Chairman Duncan, former Maryland Lt. Gov. [[Michael Steele]] described the party as being at a crossroads and not knowing what to do. "I think I may have some keys to open the door, some juice to turn on the lights," he said.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/11/michael_steele_to_run_for_rnc.html?nav=rss_blog |title=Michael Steele to Run For RNC Chair |access-date=February 12, 2009 |last=Cillizza |first=Chris |date=November 13, 2008 |work=[[The Fix (blog)|The Fix]] |publisher=The Washington Post}}</ref>

Six people ran for the 2009 RNC Chairmanship: Steele, [[Ken Blackwell]], [[Mike Duncan]], [[Saul Anuzis]], [[Katon Dawson]] and [[Chip Saltsman]]. After Saltsman's withdrawal, there were only five candidates during the hotly contested balloting January 30, 2009.

After the third round of balloting that day, Steele held a small lead over incumbent Mike Duncan of [[Kentucky]], with 51 votes to Duncan's 44. Shortly after the announcement of the standings, Duncan dropped out of contention without endorsing a candidate.<ref>Armbinder, Mark.

Mississippi Governor and former RNC chair [[Haley Barbour]] has suggested the party will focus its efforts on congressional and gubernatorial elections in the coming years rather than the next presidential election. "When I was chairman of the Republican National Committee the last time we lost the White House in 1992 we focused exclusively on 1993 and 1994. And at the end of that time, we had both houses of Congress with Republican majorities, and we'd gone from 17 Republican governors to 31. So anyone talking about 2012 today doesn't have their eye on the ball. What we ought to worry about is rebuilding our party over the next year and particularly in 2010," Barbour said at the November 2008 Republican Governors conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTgxMDMyNTU4NTE2MjM5MDQyNDlkMzU0YTlkNmNiMjQ= |title=Palin, the Governors, and the New Power in the Republican Party |access-date=February 12, 2009 |last=York |first=Byron |author-link=Byron York |date=November 13, 2008 |publisher=National Review Online |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109203529/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTgxMDMyNTU4NTE2MjM5MDQyNDlkMzU0YTlkNmNiMjQ= |archive-date=January 9, 2009}}</ref>
