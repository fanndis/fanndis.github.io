==Biography==
[[File:Vladimir Putin 18 March 2002-3.jpg|thumb|In the [[Kremlin]] in 2002 with [[Vladimir Putin]].]]

Symonenko was born in [[Donetsk]]. He became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1978, and worked as a party [[apparatchik|functionary]] in 1980s. He has been the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine]] since 1993. He is also the Chairman of the Communist Party Faction in the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (parliament).<ref name=Opening>[http://portal.rada.gov.ua/rada/control/en/publish/article/info_left?art_id=102494&cat_id=102006 "Opening of the First Session of The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine of the 6th Convocation"], Verkhovna Rada website, 23 November 2007.</ref>

Symonenko has been a Ukrainian delegate to the Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]]. From 1994 to 1996 he was a member of the Ukrainian parliament's Constitution Commission.

He was a candidate in the [[1999 Ukrainian presidential election|1999 presidential election]], receiving 22.24% of the votes in the first round and taking second place. In the second round he won 37.8% of the votes, losing to [[Leonid Kuchma]]. His election program had classic communist content.<!--what is "classic communist content"?-->

In late 2002 [[Viktor Yushchenko]] ([[Our Ukraine (political party)|Our Ukraine]]), [[Oleksandr Moroz]] ([[Socialist Party of Ukraine]]), [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] ([[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]]) and Symonenko issued a joint statement concerning "the beginning of a state [[revolution]] in Ukraine". The communist left the alliance, Symonenko was against a single candidate from the alliance in the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|Ukrainian presidential election 2004]], but the other three parties remained allies<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wp7VKL4p7kQC&pg=PA117 Understanding Ukrainian Politics: Power, Politics, and Institutional Design] by [[Paul D'Anieri]], [[M.E.

Symonenko's support sharply declined at the time of the 2004 presidential election. Symonenko received 5% of the votes and came in fourth place, unable to get into the controversial runoff which caused the [[Orange Revolution]].

Symonenko was re-elected to the [[Verkhovna Rada]] in the [[2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election|September 2007 parliamentary election]].<ref name=Prav>[http://www.pravda.com.ua/en/news/2007/11/5/9329.htm "The Makeup of the New Verkhovna Rada"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317182108/http://www.pravda.com.ua/en/news/2007/11/5/9329.htm |date=2008-03-17 }}, ''Ukrayinska Pravda'', November 5, 2007.</ref> At the opening of the new parliament's first session on 23 November 2007, he was re-elected as Chairman of the Communist Party faction.<ref name=Opening/>

The [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine]] did not register his candidacy for the [[2019 Ukrainian presidential election]] due to the fact that the statute, name and symbolism of the Communist Party of Ukraine did not comply with [[Decommunization in Ukraine|2015 decommunization laws]].<ref name="7206166UPCECb"/>

===Stance on Holodomor===

On 28 November 2006, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) narrowly passed a law defining the [[Holodomor]] as a deliberate act of genocide and made public denial illegal. Commenting in 2007, Symonenko said he "does not believe there was any deliberate starvation at all," and accused [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]] of "using the famine to stir up hatred."  In response, Yushchenko declared he wants "a new law criminalising Holodomor denial."<ref name="Sheeter">Laura Sheeter, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7111296.stm "Ukraine remembers famine horror"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 24 November 2007</ref>
