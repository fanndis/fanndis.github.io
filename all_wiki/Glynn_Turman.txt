==Biography==
===Background and education===
Turman was born in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. According to a [[genetic testing|DNA analysis]], Turman shares maternal ancestry with the [[Edo people]] of [[Nigeria]].<ref>{{YouTube|kmYKOGCao40|Glynn Turman Ancestry Reveal}}</ref> Turman studied at [[High School of Performing Arts]] located in the Manhattan section of New York City, graduating in 1965.<ref>[https://alumniandfriends.org/our-community/notable-alumni/ Notable Alumni, LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts].Retrieved March 24, 2020.</ref>

===Career===
Turman had his first prominent acting role at the age of 12 as Travis Younger in the original Broadway production of [[Lorraine Hansberry]]'s classic ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'', opposite [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Claudia McNeil]], [[Ivan Dixon]], [[Louis Gossett Jr.]], [[Lonne Elder III]], [[John Fiedler]] and [[Diana Sands]]. While he did not play the role when it transferred to film in 1961, Turman intensified his studies in high school.

Upon graduation, he apprenticed in regional and repertory companies throughout the country, including [[Tyrone Guthrie]]'s Repertory Theatre, in which he performed in late 1960s productions of ''Good Boys'', ''Harper's Ferry'', ''The Visit'', and ''The House of Atreus''. He made his [[Los Angeles]] stage debut in [[William Hanley]]’s ''Slow Dance on the Killing Ground''. An impressive 1974 performance in ''The Wine Sellers'' earned him a Los Angeles Critics Award nomination and a Dramalogue Award. The play was also produced on Broadway as ''What The Wine Sellers Buy''. He won his first [[NAACP Image Award]] for his work in the play ''Eyes of the American''.

A stage director as well, he received his second NAACP Image award for his directing of ''Deadwood Dick'' at the Inner City Cultural Center. He segued these directing talents to TV where he helmed several episodes of ''[[The Parent 'Hood]]'', ''[[Hangin' with Mr. Cooper]]'', and ''[[The Wayans Bros]]'', among others. He also directed during his seasons of steady employment on ''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]'', in which he played the role of Colonel Taylor for five seasons; from 1988 until 1993.

Turman began his film career in the 1970s with such [[blaxploitation]] flicks as ''[[Five on the Black Hand Side]]'' (1973), ''[[Thomasine & Bushrod]]'' (1974) and ''[[Together Brothers]]'' (1974), then progressed to roles in ''[[Cooley High]]'' (1975), plus ''[[The River Niger (film)|The River Niger]]'' (1976), ''[[J. D.'s Revenge]]'' (1976) and ''[[A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a Sandwich (film)|A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a Sandwich]]'' (1978). TV movies included ''[[Carter's Army]]'', the prestigious ''[[Centennial (miniseries)|Centennial]]'', ''[[Attica (film)|Attica]]'', and ''Minstrel Man'', for which he won his third NAACP Image Award.

Turman's television directorial accolades have been overshadowed only in part because of his bold and dignified presence in front of the camera. Given the opportunity, he directed an all White cast television show, [[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|''Dynasty'']], directing season 3, episode 21, "[[Dynasty (1981 TV series, season 3)|The Vote]]", which aired on ABC on March 16, 1983.  This added an African-American presence to the cast and production team, before [[Diahann Carroll]] made her grand entrance being cast as [[Dominique Deveraux|Dominique Devereaux]]. This solidified Turman's talent both in front and behind the camera.

The quality of Turman's work has shown over the decades with his participation in such prominent TV movies as ''Race to Freedom: The Underground Railroad'' in 1994, ''[[Buffalo Soldiers (1997 film)|Buffalo Soldiers]]'', and ''[[Freedom Song (film)|Freedom Song]]''. More notable films include ''[[Penitentiary II]]'' (1982), ''[[Gremlins]]'' (1984), ''[[Deep Cover]]'' (1992), ''[[How Stella Got Her Groove Back]]'' (1998), ''[[Men of Honor]]'' (2000), ''[[Sahara (2005 film)|Sahara]]'' (2005), ''[[Kings of the Evening]]'' (2007), ''[[Burlesque (2010 American film)|Burlesque]]'' (2010) and ''[[Super 8 (2011 film)|Super 8]]'' (2011). In 2004, he joined the hit HBO series ''[[The Wire]]'' portraying the recurring role of Mayor [[Clarence Royce]], becoming a full-time regular in 2006. His portrayal of Mayor Royce has earned him an NAACP Image Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for the 2007 awards ceremony.<ref name="Hollywood Reporter Image 2007">{{Cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/features/e3i1df4dfd4706f9fc31fefc3974392be1d |title=2007 Image Award nominees and winners |access-date=5 November 2007 |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=1 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315204254/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/features/e3i1df4dfd4706f9fc31fefc3974392be1d |archive-date=March 15, 2007 |publisher=[[The Nielsen Company]]}}</ref>

He is currently{{when|date=December 2016}} performing and producing a one-man show, ''Movin' Man,'' about his life and plans a book as well.

Turman was almost cast for the role of [[Han Solo]] in ''[[Star Wars]]''. In a 2007 interview, Turman recalled: "That was in George Lucas' book. Apparently [[George Lucas]] had me in mind for the role, and then thought that there might be too much controversy between a white [[Princess Leia]] and a black Han Solo – because those were the times – and he didn't want to get into that. At the time, I had no idea. I just went to the audition, did it and got out of there."<ref name="Creative Loafing Atlanta">{{Cite news |url=http://clatl.com/atlanta/glynn-turman/Content?oid=1268546 |title=Glynn Turman: Character actor brings star power to Atlanta |access-date=17 January 2012 |newspaper=[[Creative Loafing Atlanta]] |year=2012 |first=Curt |last=Holan |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303230419/http://clatl.com/atlanta/glynn-turman/Content?oid=1268546 |archive-date=3 March 2012}}</ref> In 2012, he began starring in ''[[House of Lies]]'' on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] as the father of the characters played by [[Don Cheadle]] and [[Larenz Tate]].
