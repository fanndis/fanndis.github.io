"'''Redemption Song'''" is a song by [[Bob Marley]]. It is the final track on [[Bob Marley and the Wailers]]' twelfth [[album]], ''[[Uprising (Bob Marley and the Wailers album)|Uprising]]'', produced by [[Chris Blackwell]] and released by [[Island Records]].<ref name=savvy>{{cite news|title=Chris Blackwell: Savvy Svengali |date=February 2005 |url=http://exclaim.ca/Features/Timeline/chris_blackwell-savvy_svengalil |first=Brent |last=Hagerman |work=Exclaim.ca |accessdate=29 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427011209/http://exclaim.ca/ |archivedate=27 April 2012 }}</ref> The song is considered one of Marley's greatest works. Some key lyrics derived from a speech given by the [[Pan-Africanist]] orator [[Marcus Garvey]] entitled "The Work That Has Been Done".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Henrietta|title=Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery: The origin and meaning behind Bob Marley’s Redemption song.|url=https://henriettavintondavis.wordpress.com/2010/03/24/redemption-song/|website=Henrietta Vinton Davis' Weblog|accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref>

At the time he wrote the song, circa 1979, [[Bob Marley]] had been diagnosed with the [[cancer]] in his toe that took his life a couple years later. According to [[Rita Marley]], "he was already secretly in a lot of pain and dealt with his own mortality, a feature that is clearly apparent in the album, particularly in this song".

Unlike most of Bob Marley's other tracks, it is strictly a solo [[acoustic music|acoustic]] recording, consisting of his singing and playing an [[acoustic guitar]], without accompaniment. The song is in the key of G major.

"Redemption Song" was released as a single in the UK and France in October 1980, and included a full band rendering of the song. This version has since been included as a bonus track on the 2001 reissue of ''Uprising'', as well as on the 2001 [[compilation album|compilation]] ''[[One Love: The Very Best of Bob Marley & The Wailers]]''. Although in live performances the full band was used for the song, the solo recorded performance remains the take most familiar to listeners.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed the song at #66 among "[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]". In 2010, the ''[[New Statesman]]'' listed it as one of the Top 20 Political Songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/music/2010/03/bob-marley-redemption-song |title=Top 20 Political Songs: Redemption Song |first=Ian K. |last=Smith |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref>

{{quote|With Bob accompanying himself on Guitar, "Redemption Song" was unlike anything he had ever recorded: an acoustic ballad, without any hint of reggae rhythm. In message and sound it recalled [[Bob Dylan]]. Biographer [[Timothy White (editor)|Timothy White]] called it an 'acoustic spiritual' and another biographer, [[Stephen Davis (music journalist)|Stephen Davis]], pointed out the song was a 'total departure', a deeply personal verse sung to the bright-sounding acoustic strumming of Bob's [[Ovation Guitar Company|Ovation Adamas]] guitar.| James Henke, author of ''Marley Legend''<ref>James Henke, ''Marley Legend: An Illustrated Life of Bob Marley'', Tuff Gong Books, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8118-5036-6}}, p. 54.</ref>}}

==Meaning and influence==

The song urges listeners to "Emancipate yourself from mental slavery," because "None but ourselves can free our minds." These lines were taken from a speech given by [[Marcus Garvey]] at Menelik Hall in Sydney, [[Nova Scotia]], during October 1937 and published in his ''Black Man'' magazine:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=o87tAAAAMAAJ&q=%22We+are+going+to+emancipate+ourselves+from+mental+slavery%22&dq=%22We+are+going+to+emancipate+ourselves+from+mental+slavery%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwigw7Dcne3OAhUCIMAKHVkKBWYQ6AEIIDAA ''Black Man''], Vol. 3, no. 10 (July 1938), pp. 7–11</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shunpiking.org/bhs/Marcus-gar.htm|title=Shunpiking Online Edition Black History Supplement 2005 .

In 2009, Jamaican poet and broadcaster [[Mutabaruka]] chose "Redemption Song" as the most influential recording in Jamaican music history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20090806/ent/ent1.html |title=Mutabaruka's 50 most influential Jamaican recordings - Tosh, Marley dominate top 10 |author=Cooke, Mel |date=6 August 2009 |work=[[Jamaica Gleaner]] |accessdate=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812014836/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20090806/ent/ent1.html |archivedate=12 August 2011 }}</ref>

In 2017 "Redemption Song" was featured in series 25 of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''Soul Music'', a documentary series exploring famous pieces of music and their emotional appeal, with contributors including Marley's art director [[Neville Garrick]], Jamaican Poet Laureate [[Lorna Goodison]], [[Grammy Award]]-winning artist [[John Legend]], and Wailers guitarist [[Don Kinsey]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09jvlnk "Redemption Song"], Series 25, ''Soul Music'', BBC Radio 4.</ref>
