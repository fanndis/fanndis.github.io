==History==

===Pre-1970s===
{{main|United Aircraft}}

===1970s and 1980s===
In 1974, [[Harry Gray (business)|Harry Gray]] left [[Litton Industries]] to become the CEO of United Aircraft.<ref name="Fernandez1983">{{Harvnb|Fernandez|1983}}.</ref> He pursued a strategy of growth and diversification, changing the parent corporation's name to United Technologies Corporation (UTC) in 1975 to reflect the intent to diversify into numerous [[high tech]] fields beyond aerospace.<ref name="Fernandez1983p246">{{Harvnb|Fernandez|1983|p=246}}.</ref> (The change became official on May 1, 1975.) The diversification was partially to balance civilian business against any overreliance on military business.<ref name="Fernandez1983"/> UTC became a [[mergers and acquisitions]] (M&A)–focused organization, with various forced takeovers of unwilling smaller corporations.<ref name="Fernandez1983"/> The next year (1976), UTC forcibly acquired [[Otis Worldwide|Otis Elevator]].<ref name="Fernandez1983pp246-251">{{Harvnb|Fernandez|1983|pp=246–251}}.</ref> In 1979, [[Carrier Corporation|Carrier Refrigeration]] and [[Mostek]] were acquired;<ref name="Fernandez1983pp260-264">{{Harvnb|Fernandez|1983|pp=260–264}}.</ref> the Carrier deal was forcible, while the Mostek deal was a [[white knight (business)|white knight]] move against hostile takeover designs by [[Gould Electronics|Gould]].

At one point the military portion of UTC's business, whose sensitivity to "excess profits" and boom/bust demand drove UTC to diversify away from it, actually carried the weight of losses incurred by the commercial M&A side of the business.<ref name="Fernandez1983"/> Although M&A activity was not new to United Aircraft, the M&A activity of the 1970s and 1980s was higher-stakes and arguably unfocused. Rather than aviation being the central theme of UTC businesses, [[high tech]] (of any type) was the new theme. Some Wall Street watchers questioned the true value of M&A at almost any price, seemingly for its own sake.<ref name="Fernandez1983"/>

Mostek was sold in 1985 to the French electronics company [[Thomson SA|Thomson]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===1990s===
UTC acquired [[Sundstrand Corporation]] in 1999, and merged it into UTC's Hamilton Standard unit to form [[Hamilton Sundstrand]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===2000s===
In 2003, UTC entered the fire and security business by purchasing [[Chubb Security]].

In 2005, UTC further pursued its stake in the fire and security business by purchasing [[Kidde]]. Also in 2005, UTC acquired Boeing's [[Rocketdyne]] division, which was merged into the [[Pratt & Whitney]] business unit and renamed [[Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne]] (later sold to [[Aerojet]] and merged into [[Aerojet Rocketdyne]].

In 2007, UTC opened the Hawk Works, a Rapid Prototyping and Military Derivatives Completion Center (RPMDCC) located west of the [[Elmira-Corning Regional Airport]] in [[Big Flats (CDP), New York|Big Flats, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2007/10/mil-071008-sikorsky01.htm|title=Sikorsky opens HAWK WORKS™ completion center for military helicopters|author=John Pike|publisher=[[GlobalSecurity.org]]|access-date=July 3, 2015}}</ref>

===2010s===
In April 2010, UTC announced that it was investing €15 million ($20 million) to set up the United Technologies Research Centre Ireland at [[University College Cork]]’s Tyndall National Institute which will carry out research on energy and security systems.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/education/us-firm-to-create-almost-100-jobs-with-clean-energy-research-centre-118262.html | title=US firm to create almost 100 jobs with 'clean energy research' centre | work=[[Irish Examiner]] | date=April 27, 2010 | access-date=July 2, 2019 | author=Fiachra O Cionnaith}}</ref>
