'''''The Lion King''''' is a 2019 American [[musical film|musical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]]<!-- Disney does not consider the film animated, even if produced animated. --> directed and produced by [[Jon Favreau]], written by [[Jeff Nathanson]], and produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is a [[photorealistic]] [[computer-animated]] remake of Disney's [[Traditional animation|traditionally animated]] [[The Lion King|1994 film of the same name]]. The film stars the voices of [[Donald Glover]], [[Seth Rogen]], [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Alfre Woodard]], [[Billy Eichner]], [[John Kani]], [[John Oliver]], [[Florence Kasumba]], [[Eric Andre]], [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[JD McCrary]], [[Shahadi Wright Joseph]], and [[Beyoncé Knowles-Carter]], as well as [[James Earl Jones]] reprising his role from the original film. The plot follows [[Simba]], a young lion who must embrace his role as the rightful king of his native land following the murder of his father, [[Mufasa]], at the hands of his uncle, [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]].

Plans for a remake of 1994's ''The Lion King'' were confirmed in September 2016 following box office successes for Disney remakes such as ''[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (2016), which was also directed by Favreau. Favreau was inspired by certain roles of characters in the [[The Lion King (musical)|Broadway adaptation]], and developed upon elements of the original film's story. Much of the main cast signed in early 2017, and [[principal photography]] began in mid-2017 on a [[Chroma key|blue screen stage]] in Los Angeles. The "virtual-reality tools" utilized in ''The Jungle Book''{{'}}s cinematography were used to a greater degree during filming of ''The Lion King''. Composers [[Hans Zimmer]], [[Elton John]], and lyricist [[Tim Rice]], all of whom worked on the original's soundtrack, returned to compose the score alongside Knowles-Carter, who assisted John in the reworking of the soundtrack and wrote a new song for the film, titled "[[Spirit (Beyoncé song)|Spirit]]", which she also performed. The film serves as the final credit for editor [[Mark Livolsi]], and it is dedicated to his memory. With an estimated budget of around $260&nbsp;million, it is one of the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive films ever made]].

The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 19, 2019. It has grossed over $1.6&nbsp;billion worldwide, surpassing ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' to become the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|highest-grossing animated film of all time]]. It is also the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|second-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT.

== Plot ==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. Please check the word count before making any additions. -->
In the Pride Lands of Africa, a pride of lions rule over the animal kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa's and Queen Sarabi's newborn son, [[Simba]], is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the [[mandrill]], the kingdom's [[Shamanism|shaman]] and advisor.

Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the "circle of life", which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother, [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]], covets the throne and plots to end Mufasa and Simba, so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend [[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]] into exploring a forbidden [[elephants' graveyard]], where they are attacked by hyenas led by the ruthless [[List of characters in The Lion King#Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed|Shenzi]]. Mufasa is alerted about the incident by his [[majordomo]], the [[hornbill]] Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though upset with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Meanwhile, Scar visits the hyenas and manages to convince them to help him overthrow Mufasa in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands.

Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing that the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to leave the kingdom and never return. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing Shenzi's clan to live in the Pride Lands.

Simba collapses in a desert and is rescued by [[Timon and Pumbaa]], a [[meerkat]] and [[warthog]].  Simba grows up in the oasis with his two new friends and other animals in their oasis, living a carefree life under the motto "[[hakuna matata]]" ("no worries" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]).

Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He then encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing that he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.

Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who was about to fight Sarabi. Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba forces him to show the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame his crimes on the hyenas; Simba spares his life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar refuses and attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to throw him off the cliff after a brief fight. Scar survives the fall but is attacked and mauled to death by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterward, Simba takes over the kingship and makes Nala his queen.

With the Pride Lands restored to its usual state, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.

* [[Donald Glover]] as [[Simba]]:<br/>A lion who is the crown prince of the Pride Lands. Glover said that the film will focus more on Simba's time growing up than the original film did, stating that "[Favreau] was very keen in making sure we saw [Simba's] transition from boy to man and how hard that can be when there's been a deep trauma".<ref name="YoutubeEW">{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftRPVHyELXo&t=19s |title=What To Expect From The Characters in the Upcoming 'The Lion King' Adaptation |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |medium=[[YouTube]] |time=0:19 |date=April 25, 2019 |access-date=April 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721115959/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftRPVHyELXo&t=19s |archive-date=July 21, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>
** [[JD McCrary]] as young Simba.
* [[Seth Rogen]] as [[Timon and Pumbaa|Pumbaa]]:<br/>A slow-witted warthog who befriends and adopts a young Simba after he runs away from home. Rogen said, "[a]s an actor, I [...] don't think I'm right for every role—there are a lot of roles I don't think I'm right for even in movies I'm making—but Pumbaa was one I knew I could do well".<ref name="EW">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/25/the-lion-king-cover-story/ |title=The Lion King: EW visits the set of Disney's rule-breaking beast of a remake |first=Marc |last=Snetiker |date=April 25, 2019 |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=February 3, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190802215405/https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/25/the-lion-king-cover-story/ |archive-date=August 2, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Favreau encouraged Rogen and Timon's Billy Eichner, who did their voice recordings together, to improvise a lot.<ref name="EW2">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/05/03/lion-king-timon-pumbaa-seth-rogen-billy-eichner/ |title=The Lion King: How Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen put a new twist on Timon and Pumbaa |first=Marc |last=Snetiker |date=May 3, 2019 |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=July 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923231708/https://ew.com/movies/2019/05/03/lion-king-timon-pumbaa-seth-rogen-billy-eichner/ |archive-date=September 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Rogen's casting would also mark the first time that Pumbaa isn't played by [[Ernie Sabella]], who reprised the role for every Disney project the character was involved in.
* [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] as [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]]:<br/>The treacherous brother of Mufasa, the brother-in-law of Sarabi and the uncle of Simba who seeks to take the mantle of king of the Pride Lands. Ejiofor described Scar as more "psychologically possessed" and "brutalized" than in the original film.<ref name="EW"/> Ejiofor said that "especially with Scar, whether it's a vocal quality that allows for a certain confidence or a certain aggression, to always know that at the end of it you're playing somebody who has the capacity to turn everything on its head in a split second with outrageous acts of violence—that can completely change the temperature of a scene".<ref name="EW"/> Ejiofor also said that "[Scar and Mufasa's] relationship is completely destroyed and brutalized by Scar's way of thinking. He's possessed with this disease of his own ego and his own want".<ref name="YoutubeEW"/> Favreau said of casting Ejiofor, "[He] is just a fantastic actor, who brings us a bit of the mid-Atlantic cadence and a new take on the character. He brings that feeling of a Shakespearean villain to bear because of his background as an actor. It's wonderful when you have somebody as experienced and seasoned as Chiwetel; he just breathes such wonderful life into this character."<ref name="PressKit"/> When [[Jeremy Irons]] was interviewed on ''[[Larry King Now]]'' on November 30, 2016, he expressed interest in reprising the role.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI18dj8KBbQ |title=Is Jeremy Irons playing Scar in the 'Lion King' remake? |website=[[Ora TV]] |date=November 30, 2016 |accessdate=November 12, 2019 |archive-date=June 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627162559/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI18dj8KBbQ |url-status=live }}</ref>
* [[Alfre Woodard]] as [[Sarabi]]:<br/>The Queen of the Pride Lands, Mufasa's wife, and Simba's mother.
* [[Billy Eichner]] as [[Timon and Pumbaa|Timon]]:<br/>A wise-cracking [[meerkat]] who befriends and adopts a young Simba after he runs away from home. Eichner described Timon as "physically the smallest character, but he has one of the bigger personalities, and I love the combination of those two things. I kind of played into Timon, as I've done with many characters of mine, [the notion that] he might be small in stature but he has a huge sense of entitlement, which is always funny to play," and that "when Timon speaks and when he's quote-unquote 'being funny', he's very loud and boisterous, but [his] singing allows this vulnerable side, a slightly softer side, especially in 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' and other moments."<ref name="EW2"/> Eichner also talked about having "what some may consider a gay sensibility" that he brought to the table when he voiced Timon.<ref name="buzzf">{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adambvary/billy-eichner-lion-king-timon-lgbtq-characters |title=Billy Eichner Wants More LGBTQ Characters in Animated Movies |first=Adam |last=Vary |date=July 13, 2019 |publisher=[[BuzzFeed News]] |accessdate=July 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190902184240/https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adambvary/billy-eichner-lion-king-timon-lgbtq-characters |archive-date=September 2, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

* [[John Oliver]] as [[List of The Lion King characters#Zazu|Zazu]]:<br/>A [[hornbill]] who is the [[majordomo]] to the King of the Pride Lands. Speaking of his role, Oliver said, "I think Zazu is basically a bird who likes structure. He just wants things to be as they should be. I think there are British echoes there because we tend to favor structure in lieu of having an emotional reaction to anything."<ref name="PressKit"/>
* [[Beyoncé Knowles-Carter]] as [[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]]:<br/>Simba's childhood best friend and future love interest.

MPC was in charge of all the VFX shots for the film. There are 1,490 VFX shots.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The animals were designed from art and photo references. From that, the characters were built; all the rigging, shapes, textures, and furs were rendered step-by-step for further improvement. After that, the animation of the animals was crafted by hand, based on the reference clips. The movements, muscles, eyes, facial expressions, and the way the animals breathe was animated for more than 30 species. The environment was created entirely in CGI from reference materials such as high-definition photos of the African landscape. All the FX simulations—such as water, dirt and fire—were created by combining VR technology with cameras shots so that scenes could be digitally built within in a VR-simulated environment.<ref name="FavreauVideoGame">{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/30/how-jon-favreau-directed-the-lion-king-inside-a-video-game |title=How Jon Favreau Directed The Lion King Inside a Video Game |website=[[IGN]] |first=Joshua |last=Yell |date=May 30, 2019 |accessdate=June 12, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605185624/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/30/how-jon-favreau-directed-the-lion-king-inside-a-video-game |archive-date=June 5, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> New software developed for the movie made it possible to create scenes with the shaky-cam look of a handheld camera.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2019-07-26/disneys-lion-king-remake-is-a-hit-its-virtual-reality-technology-could-change-how-movies-are-made |title='The Lion King's' VR helped make a hit.

On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], as of August 2020, the film held an approval rating of 52% based on 416 reviews, and an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 5.98/10.

A. A. Dowd, writing for ''The A.V.

==Follow-up film==
On September 29, 2020, ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported that a follow-up film was in development with [[Barry Jenkins]] attached to direct.<ref name="DeadlineHollywood" /> While ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said the film would be a prequel about Mufasa during his formative years, ''Deadline'' said it would be a sequel centering on both Mufasa's origins and the events after the first film, similar to ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Jeff Nathanson, the screenwriter for the remake, has reportedly finished a draft.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rubin|first1=Rebecca|last2=Lang|first2=Brent|url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/lion-king-sequel-director-barry-jenkins-1234786355/|title='The Lion King' Follow-Up in the Works With Director Barry Jenkins|work=Variety|date=September 29, 2020|accessdate=September 29, 2020|archive-date=September 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929195502/https://variety.com/2020/film/news/lion-king-sequel-director-barry-jenkins-1234786355/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Couch|first1=Aaron|last2=Kits|first2=Borys|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lion-king-prequel-in-the-works-with-director-barry-jenkins|title='Lion King' Prequel in the Works with Director Barry Jenkins|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 29, 2020|accessdate=September 29, 2020|archive-date=September 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929164424/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lion-king-prequel-in-the-works-with-director-barry-jenkins|url-status=live}}</ref>
