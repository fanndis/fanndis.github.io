'''Sir Alan James Carter Duncan''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|KCMG}} (born 31 March 1957)<ref name="Who's Who">{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.14283|title=Duncan, Rt Hon.

He was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Rutland and Melton (UK Parliament constituency)|Rutland and Melton]] and was the [[Minister of State for Europe|Minister of State for Europe and the Americas]] until his resignation on 22 July 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/minister-of-state--14|title=Minister of State for Europe and the Americas at the Foreign & Commonwealth Office – GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk}}</ref>

He began his career in the oil industry with [[Royal Dutch Shell]], and was first elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]]. After gaining several minor positions in the government of [[John Major]], he played a key role in [[William Hague]]'s successful bid for the Conservative leadership in [[1997 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|1997]]. Duncan received several promotions to the Conservative front bench, and eventually joined the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] after the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]]. He stood for the Conservative leadership in 2005, but withdrew early on because of a lack of support. Eventual winner [[David Cameron]] appointed him Shadow [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]] in December 2005; the name of the department he shadowed was changed to Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform in July 2007.

Following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], the new Conservative [[Prime Minister]] Cameron appointed Duncan as [[Minister of State]] [[Department for International Development|for International Development]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/topstorynews/2010/05/her-majestys-government-49840 |title=Her Majesty's Government |publisher=Number10.gov.uk |access-date=15 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515034600/http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/topstorynews/2010/05/her-majestys-government-49840 |archivedate=15 May 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He left this post following the [[2014 United Kingdom Cabinet reshuffle|government reshuffle in July 2014]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Rutland and Melton MP Alan Duncan receives a knighthood|url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Rutland-Melton-MP-Alan-Duncan-receives-knighthood/story-21741500-detail/story.html|work=Leicester Mercury|author=danjmartin|date=22 July 2014|access-date=22 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725095051/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Rutland-Melton-MP-Alan-Duncan-receives-knighthood/story-21741500-detail/story.html|archive-date=25 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> and was subsequently appointed a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]] in September 2014, for services to international development and to UK–Middle East relations.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=60994 |date=19 September 2014 |page=18358}}</ref> While on the backbenches, Duncan served on the [[Intelligence and Security Committee]] between 2015 and 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/sir-alan-duncan/343|title=Rt Hon Sir Alan Duncan MP|website=UK Parliament}}</ref>

==Education==
Duncan was educated at two [[independent school]]s: [[Beechwood Park School]] in [[Markyate]], and [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] in [[Northwood, London|Northwood]], at both of which he was 'Head Monitor' (head boy).<ref name="William's clumsy friend" /> He had two brothers, who also attended Beechwood Park School.

He then attended [[St John's College, Oxford]], where he [[Coxswain (rowing)|coxed]] the college [[sport rowing|first eight]], and was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1979.<ref name="Conservatives.com profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=people.person.page&PersonID=4664 |title=Alan Duncan MP |access-date=5 May 2008 |publisher=[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206083030/http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=people.person.page&PersonID=4664 |archivedate=6 December 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Whilst there, he formed a friendship with [[Benazir Bhutto]], and ran her successful campaign to become the President of the Oxford Union.<ref>{{cite news |first=Philip |last=Webster |title=Loyal colleagues are ready to reap the rewards |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3101735.ece |work=The Times |date=28 December 2007 |access-date=5 May 2008  | location=London}}</ref> He gained a [[Kennedy Scholarship]] to study at [[Harvard University]] between 1981 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/news/p71007/ |title=Medical student wins Kennedy Scholarship |access-date=22 December 2007 |date=10 August 2007 |publisher=[[Imperial College London]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717220312/http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/news/p71007/ |archivedate=17 July 2011  }}</ref>

==Business career==
After graduating from Oxford, Duncan worked as a trader of oil and refined products, first with [[Royal Dutch Shell]] (1979–81)<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/2158632.stm|title=Profile: Alan Duncan|date=2002-07-29|access-date=2019-12-03|language=en-GB}}</ref> and then for [[Marc Rich]] from 1982 to 1988<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/may/04/conservatives.politicalnews|title=Shadow minister accused of supplying apartheid regime|last=Pallister|first=David|date=2001-05-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-12-03|last2=Maguire|first2=Kevin|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> (Rich became a fugitive from justice in 1983).

In 1989, Duncan set up the independent Harcourt Consultants, which advises on oil and gas matters.  He made over £1 million after helping fill the need to supply oil to Pakistan after supplies from Kuwait had been disrupted in the [[Gulf War]].<ref name="William's clumsy friend" />

==Political career==
Duncan was an active member of the [[Battersea (UK Parliament constituency)|Battersea]] Conservative Association from 1979 until 1984,<ref name="Conservatives.com profile" /> when he moved to live in [[Singapore]], from which he returned in 1986. After [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] resigned in November 1990, he offered his home in [[Westminster]] as the headquarters of [[John Major]]'s leadership campaign.<ref name="William's clumsy friend" />

===Member of Parliament===
Duncan first stood for Parliament as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], unsuccessfully contesting the [[safe seat|safe]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Barnsley West and Penistone (UK Parliament constituency)|Barnsley West and Penistone]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/sir-alan-duncan/343|title=Rt Hon Sir Alan Duncan|website=UK Parliament|language=English|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> For the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] he was selected as the Conservative candidate for [[Rutland and Melton (UK Parliament constituency)|Rutland and Melton]], a safe Conservative seat, which he retained with a 59% share of the votes cast. In the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|Labour landslide of 1997]], his proportion of the vote was reduced to 46% but has since increased to 48% in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]], 51% in [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]] and 51% in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/alan-duncan/25590 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120081420/http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/alan-duncan/25590 |archivedate=20 January 2012  }}</ref>

From 1993 to 1995, Duncan was a member of the Social Security Select Committee.<ref name="Conservatives.com profile"/> His first governmental position was as [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to the [[Minister of Health]], a position he obtained in December 1993. He resigned from the position within a month, after it emerged that he had used the [[Right to Buy]] programme to make profits on property deals.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ministers of the Crown |last=Brazier |first=Rodney |author-link=Rodney Brazier |year=1997 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-825988-3 |page=112 }}</ref> It emerged that he had lent his elderly next-door neighbour money to buy his home under the Right to Buy legislation. The neighbour bought an 18th-century [[council house]] at a significant discount and sold it to Duncan just over three years later.<ref name="Alan Duncan claimed thousands">{{cite news |title=Alan Duncan claimed thousands for gardening: MPs' expenses |first=Holly |last=Watt |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=10 May 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5304976/Alan-Duncan-claimed-thousands-for-gardening-MPs-expenses.html | location=London}}</ref> [[Gyles Brandreth]] describes this event in his diary as "little Alan Duncan has fallen on his sword.

After returning to the backbenches, he became Chairman of the Conservative Backbench Constitutional Affairs Committee.<ref name="Conservatives.com profile" /> He returned to government in July 1995, when he was again appointed a Parliamentary Private Secretary, this time to the [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]], [[Brian Mawhinney]].<ref name="Conservatives.com profile" /> In November 1995, Duncan performed a [[citizen's arrest]] on an Asylum Bill protester who threw paint and flour at Mawhinney on [[College Green, London|College Green]].<ref name="Loyal colleagues are ready to reap the rewards">{{cite news|last1=Sylvester |first1=Rachel |last2=Copley |first2=Joy |title=Loyal colleagues are ready to reap the rewards |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1997/06/20/nboy220.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=20 June 1997 |access-date=28 April 2008 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506174051/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1997%2F06%2F20%2Fnboy220.html |archivedate=6 May 2008 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Duncan was involved in the [[1997 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|1997 leadership contest]], being the right-hand man of [[William Hague]], the eventual winner. In this capacity, he was called "the closest thing [the Conservatives] have to [[Peter Mandelson]]".<ref name="Loyal colleagues are ready to reap the rewards" /> Duncan and Hague had both been at Oxford, both been Presidents of the Oxford Union, and had been close friends since at least the early 1980s.<ref name="Loyal colleagues are ready to reap the rewards" />

===Front-bench career===
As a reward for his loyalty to Hague during the leadership contest,<ref name="Loyal colleagues are ready to reap the rewards" /> in June 1997, Duncan was entrusted with the positions of Vice Chairman of the Conservative Party and Parliamentary Political Secretary to the Party Leader. He became Shadow Health Minister in June 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmwib/wb980606/shadow.htm|title=Opposition front bench team as at 5 June 1998|date=6 June 1998|work=House of Commons Weekly Information Bulletin|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|access-date=25 September 2008}}</ref> A year later he was made Shadow Trade and Industry spokesman, and he was appointed a front-bench spokesman on Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in September 2001.

When [[Michael Howard]] became Conservative Party leader in November 2003, Duncan became Shadow [[Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs]], but as Howard had significantly reduced the size of the [[Shadow Cabinet]], Duncan was not promoted to the top table. This continued to be the case when he was moved to become Shadow [[Secretary of State for International Development]] in September 2004. However, following the 2005 general election, the Shadow Cabinet was expanded to its original size once more, and Duncan joined it as Shadow [[Secretary of State for Transport]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rutlandmeltonconservatives.org/alan-duncan|title=Alan Duncan|website=Rutland & Melton|language=en|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>

He held this position for just seven months, becoming Shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on 7 December 2005, after David Cameron's election to the party leadership the previous day. On 2 July 2007, he was appointed Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, as new prime minister [[Gordon Brown]] had abolished the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] the previous week, replacing it with the aforementioned new department. In January 2009, Duncan became [[Shadow Leader of the House of Commons]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/08/george-young-shadow-leader-commons|title=George Young replaces Alan Duncan as shadow Commons leader|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|date=2009-09-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-12-03|last2=Sparrow|first2=Andrew|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

===Failed leadership bid===
Before the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], he was rumoured to be planning a leadership campaign in the event that then-leader Michael Howard stepped down after a (then-likely and later actual) election defeat.<ref name="Duncan willing to run for Tory leadership">{{cite news |first=Michael |last=White |author-link=Michael White (journalist) |title=Duncan willing to run for Tory leadership |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/dec/21/conservatives.politics |work=The Guardian |date=21 December 2004 |access-date=5 May 2008 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080510192555/http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/dec/21/conservatives.politics| archivedate= 10 May 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> On 10 June 2005, Duncan publicly declared his intention of standing in the [[2005 Conservative Party (UK) leadership election|2005 leadership election]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4078868.stm |title=Duncan to run for Tory leadership |access-date=20 November 2007 |date=10 June 2005 |work=BBC News }}</ref> However, on 18 July 2005, he withdrew from the race, admitting in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that his withdrawal was due to a lack of 'active lieutenants', and urged the party to abandon those that he dubbed the 'Tory [[Taliban]]':
{{quote|Our Achilles heel, though, has been our social attitude. Censorious judgmentalism from the moralising wing, which treats half our own countrymen as enemies, must be rooted out.

On 15 May 2009, the satirical BBC programme ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' showed footage of Duncan's previous appearance on the show in which he boasted about his second home allowance, denied that he should pay any of the money back and stated it was "a great system". The show then cut to footage of David Cameron announcing that Duncan would return money to the fees office, followed by Duncan's personal apology, in which he called for the system to be changed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8243935.stm|title=Duncan: 'It's a great system'|work=BBC News|date=8 September 2009|access-date=20 February 2017}}</ref>

===WikiLeaks 2010===
According to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/8166468/WikiLeaks-US-spies-on-Alan-Duncan.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Harry | last=Wallop | title=WikiLeaks: US spies on Alan Duncan | date=29 November 2010}}</ref> and ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/nov/28/us-spies-dossier-alan-duncan | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Leigh | title=Spies drew up dossier on Alan Duncan | date=28 November 2010}}</ref> to assess the possible policies of a future Conservative government, American Intelligence drew up a dossier on several members of that party, including Duncan. It compiled details of his political associations with leading Conservatives, including [[William Hague]]. The cable called for further intelligence on "Duncan's relationship with Conservative party leader David Cameron and William Hague", and asked: "What role would Duncan play if the Conservatives form a government? What are Duncan's political ambitions?"

===Nuclear power===
As shadow business secretary in 2008, Duncan stated, referring to the Hinkley Point C project, that "on no account should there be any kind of subsidy for nuclear power."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7181255.stm | title=BBC News | access-date=13 August 2016| date=10 January 2008 }}</ref>

===Middle East===
In August 2011 he found himself under pressure to remove a video of himself accusing Israel of a "land grab" in the occupied territories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/53621/government-chaos-over-alan-duncans-land-grab-video|title=Government in chaos over Alan Duncan's 'land grab' video}}</ref> In an October 2014 speech to the [[Royal United Services Institute]] Duncan said: "Indeed just as we rightly judge someone as unfit for public office if they refuse to recognise Israel, so we should shun anyone who refuses to recognise settlements are illegal. No settlement endorsers should be regarded as fit to stand for public office, remain a member of a mainstream political party or sit in a parliament. How can we accept lawmakers in our country or any other country when they support lawbreakers in another?"<ref>{{cite news |last=Wintour |first=Patrick|title=Why might an Israeli diplomat believe Alan Duncan needs 'taking down'? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/08/why-might-an-israeli-diplomat-believe-alan-duncan-needs-taking-down |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London|date=8 January 2017|access-date=12 January 2017}}</ref> In a [[BBC Radio]] interview linked to that speech and another given during a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate on Palestinian statehood he said: "All know that the United States is in hock to a very powerful financial lobby which dominates its politics." Commenting on Duncan's statements, a spokesman for the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] called him "breathtakingly one-sided".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/British-MP-condemned-for-anti-Israel-comments-379246 |title=British MP condemned for anti-Israel comments|newspaper= Jerusalem Post |date=19 October 2014|access-date=20 October 2014}}</ref>

===Libyan oil cell===
In August 2011, it was reported that Duncan had played an instrumental role in blocking fuel supplies to [[Tripoli, Libya]], during the [[Operation Ellamy|Libyan conflict]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14740054|title=Landale Online: How UK unit starved Gaddafi of fuel|first=James|last=Landale|date=31 August 2011|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC News}}</ref> In April 2011, the former oil trader convinced the UK prime minister to establish the so-called 'Libyan oil cell' which was run out of the Foreign Office.

The cell advised NATO to blockade the port of [[Zawiya, Libya|Zawiya]] to stifle [[Muammar Gaddafi|Gaddafi]]'s war effort. They also helped identify other passages the smugglers were using to get fuel into Libya via [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]].

London-based oil traders were encouraged to sell fuel to rebels in [[Benghazi]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/93aecc44-d6f3-11e0-bc73-00144feabdc0|title=Subscribe to read {{!}} Financial Times|website=www.ft.com|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> with communication being established between traders and the rebels to route the fuel.

One Whitehall source commented: 'The energy noose tightened around Tripoli's neck. It was much more effective and easier to repair than bombs. It is like taking the key of the car away. You can't move. The great thing is you can switch it all back on again if Gaddafi goes. It is not the same as if you have bombed the whole city to bits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/sep/01/cameron-oil-gaddafi-frontline-forces|title=How Cameron's secret unit choked off oil supplies to Gaddafi's frontline forces|first1=Polly|last1=Curtis|first2=Nicholas|last2=Watt|date=31 August 2011|via=The Guardian}}</ref>

On 2 October 2017, Duncan spoke at the Chicago Council of Global Affairs.

{{quote|The manner in which the campaign was fought stirred up a lot of sentiment amongst people that are not habitual voters, particularly on the issue of immigration.

Following the release of the [[Panama Papers#United Kingdom|Panama Papers]], which contained revelations about [[David Cameron]]'s income from overseas funds set up by his father, Duncan defended the Prime Minister.

==Works and appearances==

===Books===
He has written two books: ''An End To Illusions'' (Demos, 1993) {{ISBN|1-898309-05-1}},
and ''[[Saturn's Children (political science book)|Saturn’s Children: How the State Devours Liberty, Prosperity and Virtue]]''
[with Dominic Hobson], ([[Sinclair-Stevenson]], 1995) {{ISBN|1-85619-605-4}}.
The latter book presents a detailed case regarding the history and consequences of government control over institutions and activities which were historically private, to the extent that many citizens assume that privately or communally developed municipal facilities and universities are creations of the state, and that prohibitions on drug use, sex, and personal defence have always existed.
