It is recognised by the [[International Tennis Federation]] and by the French Minister for Sports. Its headquarters are at the [[Stade de Roland Garros|Roland Garros stadium]]. It was founded under the name ''Fédération Française de Lawn Tennis'' until it changed to the ''Fédération Française de Tennis'' in 1976. The roles of the FFT include organising tennis competitions in France, most notably the [[French Open]], supporting and co-ordinating tennis clubs, and managing the French tennis teams, including their [[Davis Cup]] and [[Fed Cup]] teams. 
<!-- This very much dispriportionately UNDUE for such a short article. Literally half the article is about one controversy around one player!
The FFT does not allow private coaches during Fed Cup. This policy did not allow French no. 1 [[Marion Bartoli]] to take part in the Fed Cup in 2012 with her personal coach, who was then her father. The FFT has said it will not change its team rules just to suit one player.<ref>[http://www.tennischannel.com/news/NewsDetails.aspx?newsid=10653 Matt Cronin: Marion Bartoli tells Matt she is ready to go to war over Olympic snub]</ref> That cost Marion the chance to play at [[Olympics 2012]] in London. It is notable that she won the Wimbledon [[Grand Slam title]] one year later.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/sports/tennis/bartoli-vanquishes-nerves-and-lisicki-in-wimbledon-final.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 Bartoli Vanquishes Nerves and Lisicki in Wimbledon Final]</ref> -->
