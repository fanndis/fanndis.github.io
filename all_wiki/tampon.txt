A '''tampon''' is a [[feminine hygiene|menstrual]]  product designed to absorb blood and vaginal secretions by insertion into the [[vagina]] during [[menstruation]]. Unlike a [[Sanitary napkin|pad]], it is placed internally, inside of the [[vaginal canal]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Period Products: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly|url=https://uthealthaustin.org/blog/period-products|access-date=2020-08-04|website=UT Health Austin|language=en-us}}</ref> Once inserted correctly, a tampon is held in place by the vagina and expands as it soaks up menstrual blood. In addition to menstrual blood, the tampon also absorbs the vagina's natural lubrication and bacteria, which can change the normal [[pH]], increasing the risk of [[infection]]s from the bacterium [[Staphylococcus aureus]] (S. aureus), which can lead to [[toxic shock syndrome]] (TSS).<ref name=":1" /><ref name="Vostral 447–459">{{Cite journal|last=Vostral|first=Sharra L.|date=December 2011|title=Rely and Toxic Shock Syndrome: A Technological Health Crisis|journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine|volume=84|issue=4|pages=447–459|issn=0044-0086|pmc=3238331|pmid=22180682}}</ref> TSS is a rare, but life-threatening infection that requires immediate medical attention.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)|url=https://www.saintlukeskc.org/health-library/toxic-shock-syndrome-tss|access-date=2020-08-05|website=Saint Luke's Health System|language=en}}</ref>

The majority of tampons sold are made of [[rayon]], or a blend of rayon and [[cotton]], along with synthetic fibers.<ref>{{Cite web|last=CNN|first=Nadia Kounang|title=What's in your pad or tampon?|url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/11/13/health/whats-in-your-pad-or-tampon/index.html|access-date=2020-07-28|website=CNN}}</ref> Some tampons are made out of organic cotton. Tampons are available in several absorbency ratings. Brands include (but are not limited to) [[Kotex]], [[Playtex]], [[Tampax]], [[O.b.

Several countries regulate tampons as medical devices. In the United States, they are considered to be a Class II medical device by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Product Classification|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPCD/classification.cfm?ID=3983|access-date=2020-08-03|website=www.accessdata.fda.gov}}</ref> They are sometimes used for [[hemostasis]] in [[surgery]].[[File:Tampon inserted.svg|thumb|Tampon inserted|alt=|259x259px]]

==Design and packaging==

[[File:Playtex tampon.jpg|alt=|thumb|Applicator tampon|263x263px]]
Tampon design varies between companies and across product lines in order to offer a variety of applicators, materials and absorbencies.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pamf.org/teen/health/femalehealth/periods/tampons.html|title= Tampons|website= Palo Alto Medical Foundation|access-date= October 28, 2014}}</ref> There are two main categories of tampons based on the way of insertion - digital tampons inserted by finger, and applicator tampons. Tampon applicators may be made of plastic or cardboard, and are similar in design to a syringe. The applicator consists of two tubes, an "outer", or barrel, and "inner", or plunger. The outer tube has a smooth surface to aid insertion and sometimes comes with a rounded end that is petaled.<ref name=":6">{{cite web |url= http://www.steadyhealth.com/articles/Using_tampons__Facts_and_Myths_a53.html|title= Using Tampons: Facts And Myths|website= SteadyHealth|access-date= October 28, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Madaras2007">{{cite book|author=Lynda Madaras|title=What's Happening to My Body?

Differences exist in the way tampons expand when in use: applicator tampons generally expand axially (increase in length), while digital tampons will expand radially (increase in diameter).<ref name="MyUser_Steadyhealth.com_October_28_2014c">{{cite web |url=http://www.steadyhealth.com/medical-answers/pain-while-inserting-a-tampon.html |title=Pain While Inserting A Tampon |newspaper=Steadyhealth.com |access-date=October 28, 2014}}</ref> Most tampons have a cord or string for removal. The majority of tampons sold are made of rayon, or a blend of [[rayon]] and [[cotton]]. Organic cotton tampons are made from only 100% cotton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edana.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/tampons-for-menstrual-hygiene---modern-products-with-ancient-roots.pdf?sfvrsn=0|title=Tampons for menstrual hygiene: Modern products with ancient roots|access-date=October 28, 2014}}</ref> Tampons may also come in scented or unscented varieties.<ref name=":6" />

===Absorbency ratings===

[[Image:Tamponlable.jpg|thumb|right| 2 water drop marks mean that the absorbency is between 6 and 9&nbsp;g.]]

==== In the US ====
Tampons are available in several absorbency ratings, which are consistent across manufacturers in the U.S. These differ in the amount of cotton in each product and are measured based on the amount of fluid they are able to absorb.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tampon Absorbency Ratings - Which Tampon is Right for You|url=http://pms.about.com/od/hygiene/f/tampon_absorben.htm|access-date=October 28, 2014|newspaper=Pms.about.com}}</ref> The absorbency rates required by the FDA for manufacturer labeling are listed below:<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=CFR - Code of Federal Regulations Title 21|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=801.430|access-date=2020-08-04|website=www.accessdata.fda.gov}}</ref>

==== In the UK ====
In the UK, the Absorbent Hygiene Product Manufacturers Association (AHPMA) has written a Tampon Code of Practice which companies can follow on a volunteer basis.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tampon Code of Practice|url=http://www.ahpma.co.uk/tampon_code_of_practice/|access-date=2020-10-19|website=AHPMA|language=en-GB}}</ref> According to this code, UK manufacturers should follow the (European) EDANA code (see above).

=== Testing ===
A piece of test equipment referred to as a Syngyna (short for synthetic Vagina) is usually used to test absorbency. The machine uses a [[condom]] into which the tampon is inserted, and synthetic menstrual fluid is fed into the test chamber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahpma.co.uk/docs/EDANA_Syngina2.pdf |title=Data |website=www.ahpma.co.uk |access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref>

A novel way of testing was developed by feminist medical experts after the TSS crisis, and used blood  - rather than the industry standard blue saline - as a test material.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vostral|first=Sharra|date=2017-05-23|title=Toxic shock syndrome, tampons and laboratory standard–setting|journal=CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=189|issue=20|pages=E726–E728|doi=10.1503/cmaj.161479|issn=0820-3946|pmc=5436965|pmid=28536130}}</ref>

=== Labeling ===
The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] requires the manufacturer to perform absorbency testing to determine the absorbency rating using the Syngyna method or other methods that are approved by the FDA. The manufacturer is also required to include on the package label the absorbency rating and a comparison to other absorbency ratings as an attempt to help consumers choose the right product and avoid complications of [[Toxic shock syndrome|Toxic Shock Syndrome]] (TSS). In addition, The following statement of association between tampons and [[Toxic shock syndrome|Toxic Shock Syndrome]] (TSS) is required by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] to be on the package label as part of the labeling requirements: "Attention: Tampons are associated with Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). TSS is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. Read and save the enclosed information."<ref name=":2" />

Such guidelines for package labeling are more lenient when it comes to tampons bought from vending machines. For example, tampons sold in vending machines are not required by the FDA to include labeling such as absorbency ratings or information about [[Toxic shock syndrome|Toxic Shock Syndrome]] (TSS).<ref name=":2" />

=== Costs ===
The average consumer may use approximately 11,400 tampons in her lifetime (if using only tampons).<ref name=":0" /> Generally, a box of tampons costs can range from $6 to $10 and have 12 to 40 tampons per box. Thus, consumers could use around 9 boxes a year, leading to a total cost between $54 to $90 a year (around $0.20-$0.40 a tampon).<ref name=":1" />

Activists call the problem some people have when not being able to afford products, '[[Menstruation|Period Poverty'.]]

== Health aspects ==
===Toxic shock syndrome===
{{main|Toxic shock syndrome}}

Menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mTSS) is a life-threatening disease most commonly caused by infection of [[superantigen]]-producing ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. The superantigen toxin secreted in ''S. aureus'' infections is TSS Toxin-1, or [[Toxic shock syndrome toxin|TSST]]-1. Incidence ranges from 0.03 to 0.50 cases per 100,000 people, with an overall mortality around 8%.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=Selina|last2=Kunerl|first2=Anika|last3=Wasmuth|first3=Stefan|last4=Tierno|first4=Philip|last5=Wagner|first5=Karoline|last6=Brügger|first6=Jan|date=September 2019|title=Menstrual toxic shock syndrome: case report and systematic review of the literature|journal=The Lancet.

Toxic shock syndrome was named by Dr. James K. Todd in 1978.<ref name="auto">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njfQfrMr31EC&q=history+of+tampons&pg=PA142|title=The Curse: A Cultural History of Menstruation|last1=Delaney|first1=Janice|last2=Lupton|first2=Mary Jane|last3=Toth|first3=Emily|date=1988|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252014529|language=en}}</ref> Dr. Philip M. Tierno Jr., Director of Clinical [[Microbiology]] and [[Immunology]] at the [[NYU Langone Medical Center]], helped determine that tampons were behind [[toxic shock syndrome]] (TSS) cases in the early 1980s. Tierno blames the introduction of higher-absorbency tampons made with rayon in 1978, as well as the relatively recent decision by manufacturers to recommend that tampons can be worn overnight, for the surge in cases of toxic shock syndrome.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/a-new-generation-faces-toxic-shock-syndrome/| work=The Seattle Times | title=A new generation faces toxic shock syndrome | date=January 26, 2005}}</ref> However, a later [[meta-analysis]] found that the  material composition of tampons is not directly correlated to the incidence of toxic shock syndrome, whereas [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]] content of menstrual fluid uptake is associated more strongly.<ref name="LanesRothman1990">{{cite journal|last1=Lanes|first1=Stephan F.|last2=Rothman|first2=Kenneth J.|title=Tampon absorbency, composition and oxygen content and risk of toxic shock syndrome|journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology|volume=43|issue=12|year=1990|pages=1379–1385|issn=0895-4356|doi=10.1016/0895-4356(90)90105-X|pmid=2254775}}</ref><ref name="RossOnderdonk2000">{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=R.

In 1982, a liability case called ''Kehm v. Proctor & Gamble'' took place, where the family of Patricia Kehm sued [[Procter & Gamble|Proctor & Gamble]] for her death on September 6, 1982 from TSS, while using [[Rely Tampons]]. The case was the first successful case to sue the company. Proctor & Gamble paid $300,000 in compensatory damages to the Kehm family. This case can be attributed to the increase in regulations and safety protocol testing for current FDA requirements.<ref name="Vostral 447–459"/>

Some risk factors identified for developing TSS include recent [[Childbirth|labor and delivery]], tampon use, recent staphylococcus infection, recent [[surgery]], and foreign objects inside the body.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Toxic shock syndrome: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000653.htm|access-date=2020-08-05|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en}}</ref>

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] suggests the following guidelines for decreasing the risk of contracting TSS when using tampons:<ref>{{cite web|title=e-CFR: Title 21: Food and Drugs Administration|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=3485cbba7d3a26b44da17b575d046ca3&mc=true&node=pt21.8.801&rgn=div5#se21.8.801_1430|access-date=11 February 2017|website=Code of Federal Regulations|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|location=Section 801.430: User labeling for menstrual tampons}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|date=2019-02-09|title=The Facts on Tampons—and How to Use Them Safely|url=https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/facts-tampons-and-how-use-them-safely|journal=FDA|language=en}}</ref>
* Choose the lowest absorbency needed for one's flow (test of absorbency is approved by FDA)
* Follow package directions and guidelines for insertion and tampon usage (located on box's label)
* Change the tampon at least every 6 to 8 hours or more often if needed
* Alternate usage between tampons and [[Sanitary napkin|pads]]
* Avoid tampon usage overnight or when sleeping
* Increase awareness of the warning signs of Toxic Shock Syndrome and other tampon-associated health risks (and remove the tampon as soon as a risk factor is noticed)

The FDA also advises those with a history of TSS not to use tampons and instead turn to other [[feminine hygiene]] products to control menstrual flow.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)|url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/toxic-shock-syndrome-tss|access-date=2020-07-30|website=www.hopkinsmedicine.org|language=en}}</ref> Other feminine hygiene products available include pads, [[menstrual cup]]s, menstrual discs, and reusable period underwear.<ref name=":1" />

=== Other considerations ===

==== Bleached products ====
According to the Women's Environmental Network research briefing on menstrual products made from wood pulp: 'The basic ingredient for menstrual pads is wood pulp, which begins life as a brown coloured product. Various ‘purification’ processes can be used to bleach it white. Measurable levels of dioxin have been found near paper pulping mills, where chlorine has been used to bleach the wood pulp. Dioxin is one of the most persistent and toxic chemicals, and can cause reproductive disorders, damage to the immune system and cancer (26). There are no safe levels and it builds up in our fat tissue and in our environment.'<ref>https://www.wen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/SEEING-RED-BRIEFING.pdf</ref>

==== Marine pollution ====
In the UK, the Marine Conservation Society has researched the prevalence and problem of plastic tampon applicators found on beaches.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Campaigning for plastic-free periods|url=https://www.mcsuk.org/news/period-plastic|access-date=2020-10-19|website=www.mcsuk.org|language=en}}</ref>

====Disposal and flushing====

Disposal of tampons, especially flushing (which manufacturers warn against) may lead to clogged drains and waste management problems.<ref>Agencies NA of CW. International Water Industry Position Statement on non-flushable and flushable labelledproducts. 2016; Available from:<nowiki>http://www.nacwa.org/docs/default-source/resources---public/2016-11-29wipesposition3dd68e567b5865518798ff0000de1666.pdf?sfvrsn=2</nowiki></ref>

==== Tampon-drug interactions ====
There are multiple cases in which the use of tampons may need a medical advice from a healthcare professional. For example, as part of the [[National Institutes of Health]], the [[United States National Library of Medicine|U.S. National Library of Medicine]] and its branch [[MedlinePlus|MedilinePlus]] advise against using tampons while being treated with any of several medications taken by the vaginal route such as vaginal suppositories and creams, as tampons may decrease the absorbance of these drugs by the body. Example of these medications include [[Clindamycin]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Clindamycin Vaginal: MedlinePlus Drug Information|url=https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a609006.html|access-date=2020-08-05|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en}}</ref> [[Terconazole]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Terconazole Vaginal Cream, Vaginal Suppositories: MedlinePlus Drug Information|url=https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a688022.html|access-date=2020-08-05|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en}}</ref> [[Miconazole]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Miconazole Vaginal: MedlinePlus Drug Information|url=https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601203.html|access-date=2020-08-05|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en}}</ref> [[Clotrimazole]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Clotrimazole Vaginal: MedlinePlus Drug Information|url=https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682753.html|access-date=2020-08-05|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en}}</ref> when used as a vaginal cream or vaginal suppository, as well as [[Butoconazole]] Vaginal Cream.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Butoconazole Vaginal Cream: MedlinePlus Drug Information|url=https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682012.html|access-date=2020-08-05|website=medlineplus.gov|language=en}}</ref>

==== Increased risk for infections ====
According to the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT), tampons may be responsible for an increased risk of infection due to the erosions it causes in the tissue of the cervix and vagina, leaving the skin prone to infections. Thus, ASBMT advises [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation]] (HCT) recipients against using tampons while undergoing therapy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Guidelines for Preventing Opportunistic Infections Among Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients|url=https://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4910a1.htm|access-date=2020-08-06|website=www.cdc.gov}}</ref>

==Other uses==

== Environment and waste ==
Appropriate disposal of used tampons is still lacking in many countries. Because the lack of menstrual management practices in some countries, most women dispose their sanitary pads or other menstrual products into domestic solid wastes or garbage bins that eventually becomes part of a solid wastes.<ref name="Kaur">{{Cite journal|last1=Kaur|first1=Rajanbir|last2=Kaur|first2=Kanwaljit|last3=Kaur|first3=Rajinder|date=2018-02-20|title=Menstrual Hygiene, Management, and Waste Disposal: Practices and Challenges Faced by Girls/Women of Developing Countries|journal=Journal of Environmental and Public Health|volume=2018|pages=1–9|doi=10.1155/2018/1730964|issn=1687-9805|pmc=5838436|pmid=29675047}}</ref>

The issue that underlies the governance or implementation of menstrual waste management is how country categorizes menstrual waste. This waste could be considered as a common household waste, hazardous household waste (which will required to be segregated from routine household waste), biomedical waste given amount of blood it contains , or plastic waste given the plastic content in many commercial disposal pads (some only the outer case of the tampon or pads).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Elledge|first1=Myles F.|last2=Muralidharan|first2=Arundati|last3=Parker|first3=Alison|last4=Ravndal|first4=Kristin T.|last5=Siddiqui|first5=Mariam|last6=Toolaram|first6=Anju P.|last7=Woodward|first7=Katherine P.|date=November 2018|title=Menstrual Hygiene Management and Waste Disposal in Low and Middle Income Countries—A Review of the Literature|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=15|issue=11|page=2562|doi=10.3390/ijerph15112562|issn=1661-7827|pmc=6266558|pmid=30445767}}</ref>

Ecological impact varies according to disposal method (whether a tampon is flushed down the toilet or placed in a garbage bin - the latter is the recommended option).

The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm carried out a life cycle assessment (LCA) comparison of the environmental impact of tampons and sanitary pads. They found that the main environmental impact of the products was in fact caused by the processing of raw materials, particularly [[Low-density polyethylene|LDPE]] (low density polyethylene) – or the plastics used in the backing of pads and tampon applicators, and cellulose production. As production of these plastics requires a lot of energy and creates long-lasting waste, the main impact from the life cycle of these products is fossil fuel use, though the waste produced is significant in its own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thechicecologist.com/2010/04/the-environmental-impact-of-everyday-things/|title=The Environmental Impact of Everyday Things|work=The Chic Ecologist|date=2010-04-05}}</ref>

The menstrual material was disposed according to the type of product, and even based on cultural beliefs. This was done regardless of giving any importance to the location and proper techniques of disposal. In some areas of the world, women dispose of their menstrual waste into pit latrines, as burning and burial were difficult due to limited private space.<ref name="Kaur"/>

==History==
Women have used tampons during menstruation for thousands of years. In her book ''Everything You Must Know About Tampons'' (1981), Nancy Friedman writes, "There is evidence of tampon use throughout history in a multitude of cultures. The oldest printed medical document, [[Papyrus Ebers]], refers to the use of soft papyrus tampons by Egyptian women in the 15th century BCE. Roman women used wool tampons. Women in ancient Japan fashioned tampons out of paper, held them in place with a bandage, and changed them 10 to 12 times a day. Traditional Hawaiian women used the furry part of a native fern called [[hapu'u]]; and grasses, mosses and other plants are still used by women in parts of Asia."<ref>[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2252/who-invented-tampons Who invented tampons?] June 6, 2006 The Straight Dope</ref>

R. G. Mayne defined a tampon in 1860 as: "a less inelegant term for the ''plug'', whether made up of portions of rag, sponge, or a silk handkerchief, where plugging the ''vagina'' is had recourse to in cases of hemorrhage."<ref>{{cite book |first=R. G. |last=Mayne |title=An Expository Lexicon of the Terms, Ancient and Modern, in Medical and General Science including a Complete Medico-Legal Vocabulary |year=1860 |place=London |publisher=John Churchill |page=1249 |url=https://archive.org/stream/b21462124#page/n1275/mode/2up }}</ref>

Dr. [[Earle Haas]] patented the first modern tampon, [[Tampax]], with the tube-within-a-tube applicator. Gertrude Schulte Tenderich (née Voss) bought the patent rights to her company trademark Tampax and started as a seller, manufacturer, and spokesperson in 1933.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The History of Tampax|url=https://tampax.com/en-us/about/our-story/history-of-tampax/|access-date=2020-08-05|website=tampax.com|language=en-us}}</ref> Tenderich hired women to manufacture the item and then hired two sales associates to market the product to drugstores in Colorado and Wyoming; and nurses to give public lectures on the benefits of the creation; and was also instrumental in inducing newspapers to run advertisements.

In 1945, Tampax presented a number of studies to prove the safety of tampons. A 1965 study by the Rock Reproductive Clinic stated that the use of tampons "has no physiological or clinical undesired side effects".<ref name="auto"/>

During her study of female anatomy, German gynecologist Dr. [[Judith Esser-Mittag]] developed a digital-style tampon, which was made to be inserted without an applicator. In the late 1940s, Dr. Carl Hahn, together with Heinz Mittag, worked on the mass production of this tampon. Dr. Hahn sold his company to [[Johnson & Johnson|Johnson and Johnson]] in 1974.<ref name="hahn">{{cite web | url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/johnson-johnson-history/ | title=Johnson & Johnson History | publisher=Funding Universe | access-date=14 March 2014}}</ref>

In the late 1990s, it was found that tampon manufacturers were using [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxin]], a known carcinogen, in their rayon bleaching processes. Following this, major commercial tampon brands began switching from dioxin-producing chlorine gas bleaching methods to either elemental “chlorine-free” or “totally chlorine free” bleaching processes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bobel|first=Chris|date=2006-11-02|title="Our Revolution Has Style": Contemporary Menstrual Product Activists "Doing Feminism" in the Third Wave|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=54|issue=5–6|pages=331–345|doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9001-7|s2cid=17610463|issn=0360-0025}}</ref>

In the United States, the Tampon Safety and Research Act was introduced to Congress in 1997 as an effort to create transparency between tampon manufacturers and consumers. The bill would mandate the conduct or support of research on the extent to which additives in feminine hygiene products pose any risks to the health of women or to the children of women who use those products during or before the pregnancies involved.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Maloney|first=Carolyn B.|date=1997-11-14|title=H.R.2900 - 105th Congress (1997-1998): Tampon Safety and Research Act of 1997|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/house-bill/2900|access-date=2020-08-03|website=www.congress.gov}}</ref> Although yet to be passed, the bill has been continually reintroduced, most recently in 2019 as the Robin Danielson Feminine Hygiene Product Safety Act.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Maloney|first=Carolyn B.|date=2019-07-22|title=Text - H.R.3865 - 116th Congress (2019-2020): Robin Danielson Feminine Hygiene Product Safety Act of 2019|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3865/text|access-date=2020-08-03|website=www.congress.gov}}</ref> Data would also be required from manufacturers regarding the presence of dioxins, synthetic fibers, chlorine, and other components (including contaminants and substances used as fragrances, colorants, dyes, and preservatives) in their feminine hygiene products.

==Society and culture==
===Tampon tax===
{{main|Tampon tax}}
"Tampon tax" refers to tampons' lack of tax exempt status that is often in place for other basic need products.  Several political statements have been made in regards to tampon use. In 2000, a 10% [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST) was introduced in Australia. While lubricant, condoms, incontinence pads and numerous medical items were regarded as essential and exempt from the tax, tampons continue to be charged GST. Prior to the introduction of GST, several states also applied a [[luxury tax]] to tampons at a higher rate than GST. Specific petitions such as "Axe the Tampon Tax" have been created to oppose this tax, although no change has been made.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/tampon-tax-a-bloody-outrage-20130221-2etl5.html|title= Tampon tax a 'bloody outrage'|last= Orr |first= Aleisha |date= February 22, 2013 |work= [[WAtoday]] |access-date= October 28, 2014}}</ref>

In the US, access to menstrual products such as pads and tampons and taxes added on these products, have also been controversial topics especially when it comes to women with low income.<ref name=":5" /> Laws for exempting such taxes differ vastly from state to state.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|date=November 2019|title=The Unequal Price of Periods|url=https://www.aclu.org/report/unequal-price-periods|access-date=2020-08-05|website=American Civil Liberties Union|language=en}}</ref> The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) has published a report discussing these laws and listing the different guidelines followed by institutions such as schools, shelters, and prisons when providing menstrual goods.<ref name=":5" />

=== Etymology ===
Historically, the word "tampon" originated from the medieval [[French language|French]] word "[[tampion]]", meaning a piece of cloth to stop a hole, a ''stamp'', ''plug'', or ''stopper''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/tampon|title=Oxford Dictionaries - Dictionary, Thesaurus, & Grammar}}</ref>

=== Virginity ===
Tampon use may stretch or break the [[hymen]] of individuals that have never been sexually active.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Goodyear-Smith|first1=F. A.|last2=Laidlaw|first2=T. M.|date=1998-06-08|title=Can tampon use cause hymen changes in girls who have not had sexual intercourse?

=== In popular culture ===
In [[Stephen King|Stephen King's]] book ''Carrie,'' the title character is bullied for menstruating and is bombarded with tampons and pads by her peers.

In 1985, Tampon Applicator Creative Klubs International (TACKI) was established to develop creative uses for discarded, non-biodegradable, plastic feminine hygiene products, commonly referred to as “beach whistles.” TACKI President Jay Critchley launched his corporation in order to develop a global folk art movement and cottage industry, promote awareness of these throwaway objects washed up on beaches worldwide from faulty sewage systems, create the world's largest collection of discarded plastic tampon applicators, and ban their manufacture and sale through legislative action. The project and artwork was carried out during numerous site-specific performances and installations.<ref>{{Cite web|title=TACKI - TAMPON APPLICATION CREATIVE KLUBS INTERNATIONAL|url=http://www.jaycritchley.com/tacki.html|access-date=2020-10-19|website=JAY CRITCHLEY|language=en}}</ref>
