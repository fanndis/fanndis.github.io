'''Public Law 110-343''' ({{USStatute|110|343|122|3765|2008|10|3}}) is a US [[Act of Congress]] [[signed into law]] by [[U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]], which was designed to mitigate the growing [[Late-2000s financial crisis|financial crisis of the late-2000s]] by giving relief to so-called "Troubled Assets."<ref name ='White House-Press Release-2008-10-03'>[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/10/print/20081003-17.html President Bush Signs H.R. 1424 Into Law], White House Press Release, October 3, 2008.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://energypriorities.com/entries/2008/10/ptc_itc_extension_2008.php|title=Renewable Energy Tax Credits Extended as Far as 2016 (Energy Priorities Archives)|website=energypriorities.com|accessdate=9 September 2018}}</ref>

Its formal title is "An Act To provide authority for the Federal Government to purchase and insure certain types of troubled assets for the purposes of providing stability to and preventing disruption in the economy and financial system and protecting taxpayers, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide incentives for energy production and conservation, to extend certain expiring provisions, to provide individual income tax relief, and for other purposes."

The Act created a $700 billion [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] under the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] ([[S:Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|division A]]), and also enacted the ''Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008'' ([[s:Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008|division B]]), ''Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008'' ([[s:Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008|division C]]), which also included the ''Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008'', and the ''Heartland Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008''.<ref name= "LOC-THOMAS-HR1424"/><ref name= "USPL-110-343">{{USPL|110|343}}</ref>

==Legislative history==
{{main|Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008}}
The first version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (structured as an amendment to {{USBill|110|H.R.|3997}}) was rejected by the House of Representatives on September 29.

After its defeat, Senate leaders decided to amend an existing bill from the House in order to circumvent the revenue [[origination clause]] of [[U.S. Constitution]], and chose H.R. 1424 as the vehicle for the legislation.<ref name='NYT-Pear-2008-10-01'>

The Constitution says, "All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills."

== Three divisions of the Act ==

===Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008===
{{main|Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|Troubled Asset Relief Program}}

The ''Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008'' is part of an effort to [[bailout|bail out]] firms holding mortgage-backed securities in an attempt to restore liquidity to the credit markets.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tbm.thebigmoney.com/articles/juicy-bits/2008/10/01/bailout-baloney?page=full |title=Bailout Baloney: What do wooden children's arrows have to do with the credit crisis? |first=Karim |last=Bardeesy  |publisher=The Big Money |date=2008-10-02}}</ref>

===Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008===
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}

The ''Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008'' contains a new tax credit for [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s for less than a year after the first 250,000 are sold. The credit is a base $2,500 plus $417 for each [[kWh]] of battery pack capacity in excess of 4 kWh to a maximum of $15,000 for any vehicle with a [[gross vehicle weight rating]] of more than {{convert|26000|lb}} <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/1008.html|title=$1Billion Plug-In Incentives Will Speed Auto Industry's Transformation|website=www.calcars.org|accessdate=9 September 2018}}</ref> and up to $7,500 for 12 kWh or more in passenger cars (vehicles up to {{convert|8500|lb}} ).

It also extends existing tax credits for [[renewable energy]] initiatives, including [[cellulosic ethanol]] and [[biodiesel]] development, and [[wind power in the United States|wind]], [[solar energy|solar]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]] and [[hydro-electric power]].<ref>http://blogs.edmunds.com/greencaradvisor/2008/10/plug-in-tax-credits-hitching-ride-on-wall-street-bail-out-bill.html</ref> It establishes [[electricity]] as a clean-burning fuel for tax purposes.

Separately, this section also requires the reporting of [[cost basis]] by brokers to the IRS for certain securities acquired after 2011 – see [[covered security]].

===Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008===
The ''Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act'' includes $100 billion in tax breaks for businesses and the [[middle class]], plus a provision to raise the cap on [[federal deposit insurance]] from $100,000 to $250,000.<ref name=Babington>{{cite web | url=http://archive.11alive.com/news/article/121896/12/Bush-Lobbies-Congress-To-Pass-700B-Bailout-Bill- | title=Bush lobbies Congress to pass $700B bailout bill | first=Charles | last=Babington |author2=Julie Hirsschfeld Davis  |publisher=Associated Press | date=2009-10-02}}</ref>

The Act keeps the [[alternative minimum tax]] from hitting 20 million middle-income Americans. It provides $8 billion in tax relief for those hit by natural disasters in [[the Midwest]], [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]].<ref name=Babington/>

As a whole, the Senate tax package would cost $150.5 billion over 10 years. Roughly $43.5 billion would be offset by several revenue-raising provisions. [[Hedge fund]] managers would be forbidden from using [[offshore corporation]]s to defer paying taxes.<ref name='NYT-Pear-2008-10-01'/>

The bill freezes a [[tax deduction]] that [[oil companies|oil and gas companies]] get for certain domestic production activities. The deduction, now 6 percent, is scheduled to rise to 9 percent in 2010.<ref name='NYT-Pear-2008-10-01'/>

The provisions of the tax bill included:

==== Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 ====
{{main|Mental Health Parity Act#Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act}}
The ''Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008'' (a part of Division C) mandates that if U.S. [[health insurance]] companies provide coverage for mental health and substance abuse, the coverage must be equal for conditions such as [[psychological disorder]]s, [[alcoholism]], and [[drug addiction]].<ref name="USPL-110-343"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/6043529.html|title=Equal treatment: A bailout law bonus — equal coverage for mental and physical illness|date=2008-10-06|work=Houston Chronicle}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Aaron | last=Glantz | title=U.S. Insurers Told to Cover Mental Health Equally | date=2008-10-07 | url =http://us.oneworld.net/places/yemen/-/article/357889-insurers-required-cover-mental-health-equally | work =OneWorld | accessdate = 2008-10-08 }}</ref>

==Cost==
The Act increased the statutory limit on the public debt by US$700 billion to US$11.3 trillion. However, the legislation is designed to have a net zero long-term cost, and includes language that mandates the President and Congress to develop a plan to recoup any money that is not recouped within 5 years.<ref name='LOC-THOMAS-HR1424'>{{cite news | title= H.R.1424  | date= 2008-10-03  | publisher= Library of Congress | url = http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:HR1424: | work = THOMAS | accessdate = 2008-10-03 }} (Access to legislative history of H.R. 1424)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/98xx/doc9852/hr1424Dodd.htm|title=Letter from Congressional Budget Office Director|last=Orszag|first=Peter|date=2008-10-01|publisher=[[Congressional Budget Office]]|accessdate=9 May 2010|quote=That net cost is likely to be substantially less than $700 billion but is more likely than not to be greater than zero.}}</ref>
