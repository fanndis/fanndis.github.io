The '''COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand''' is part of [[COVID-19 pandemic|the ongoing pandemic]] of [[coronavirus disease 2019]] ({{nowrap|COVID-19}}) caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&nbsp;2]] ({{nowrap|SARS-CoV-2}}). The first case of the disease in [[New Zealand]] was reported on 28 February 2020. {{as of|2020|11|17}}, the country has had a total of 2,005 cases (1,649 confirmed and 356 probable{{efn|A probable case is one without a positive laboratory result, but which is treated like a confirmed case based on its exposure history and clinical symptoms.}}), of which 61 are currently active, and 25 people have died from the virus, with cases recorded in all twenty [[district health board]] (DHB) areas.<ref name="current cases">{{cite web|title=COVID-19 – current cases|url=https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-cases|date={{#time:Y-m-d}}|publisher=Ministry of Health|url-status=live}}</ref> The pandemic peaked in early April, with 89 new cases recorded per day and 929 active cases.

All borders and entry ports of New Zealand were closed to all non-residents on 19 March 2020, with returning citizens and residents being required to self-isolate. Since 10 April, all New Zealanders returning from overseas must go into two weeks of [[COVID-19 managed isolation in New Zealand|managed isolation]].

A four-level [[#Alert level system|alert level system]] was introduced on 21 March to manage the outbreak within New Zealand. The Alert Level was initially set at Level 2, but was subsequently raised to Level 3 on the afternoon of 23 March. Beginning on 25 March, the Alert Level was moved to Level 4, putting the country into a [[COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns|nationwide lockdown]]. The Alert Level was moved back down to Level 3 on 27 April, partially lifting some lockdown restrictions, and down to Level 2 on 13 May, lifting the rest of the lockdown restrictions while maintaining physical distancing and gathering size limits. The country moved down to Level 1 on 8 June, removing all remaining restrictions except border controls.

On 11 August, four cases of COVID-19 from an unknown source were reported in Auckland, the first from an unknown source in 102 days. At noon the following day, the [[Auckland Region]] moved up to alert level 3, while the rest of the country was moved to level 2.<ref name="NZH Auckland lockdown">{{Cite news|date=2020-08-11|title=Covid 19 coronavirus: Auckland in lockdown, rest of country in level 2 – Four cases of community transmission|df=dmy-all|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12355759|access-date=2020-08-11|issn=1170-0777|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200824123716/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12355759|archive-date=2020-08-24}}</ref><ref name="Stuff 11 Aug 2020">{{Cite news|date=2020-08-11|title=Live: Coronavirus – Auckland goes back into Level 3, rest of NZ into Level 2|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300078922/live-coronavirus--auckland-goes-back-into-level-3-rest-of-nz-into-level-2|access-date=2020-08-11|work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]]|df=dmy-all|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200811212225/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300078922/live-coronavirus--auckland-goes-into-level-3-compulsory-masks-mulled-supermarkets-packed|archive-date=2020-08-11}}</ref><ref name="Newshub 11 Aug 2020">{{Cite news|title=Coronavirus live updates: COVID-19 in community, Auckland going to level 3|language=en|work=[[Newshub]]|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/08/coronavirus-live-updates-covid-19-in-community-auckland-going-to-level-3.html|access-date=2020-08-11|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812064317/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/08/coronavirus-live-updates-covid-19-in-community-auckland-going-to-level-3.html|archive-date=2020-08-12}}</ref> On 30 August at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved down to "Alert Level 2.5", a modified version of Alert Level 2 with limitation on public gatherings, funerals, and weddings.<ref name="Newshub">{{cite news |last1=Andelane |first1=Lana |title=COVID-19: Auckland to move to 'level 2.5' on Sunday - what you need to know |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/08/covid-19-auckland-to-move-to-level-2-5-on-sunday-what-you-need-to-know.html |accessdate=30 August 2020 |work=[[Newshub]] |date=30 August 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200830035357/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/08/covid-19-auckland-to-move-to-level-2-5-on-sunday-what-you-need-to-know.html |archivedate=30 August 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Newstalk ZB">{{cite news |title=The new 'level 2.5' rules Aucklanders need to know before tonight |url=https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/national/what-you-will-and-wont-be-able-to-do-in-auckland-when-new-level-2-arrives/ |accessdate=30 August 2020 |work=[[Newstalk ZB]] |date=30 August 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200830035948/https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/national/what-you-will-and-wont-be-able-to-do-in-auckland-when-new-level-2-arrives/ |archivedate=30 August 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Cardwell">{{cite news|first=Hamish|last=Cardwell|url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/424786/auckland-moving-to-alert-level-2-point-5-tomorrow|title=Auckland moving to 'alert level 2.5' tomorrow|work=[[Radio New Zealand]]|date=30 August 2020|accessdate=31 August 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200830174650/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/424786/auckland-moving-to-alert-level-2-point-5-tomorrow|archive-date=30 August 2020}}</ref> On 23 September at 11:59 pm, Auckland moved down to Alert Level 2, after the rest of New Zealand moved to Alert Level 1 on 21 September at 11:59pm.<ref name="The New Zealand Herald">{{cite news |last1=Wade |first1=Amelia |title=Covid 19 coronavirus: Auckland moving to alert level 2 and NZ to level 1 - Jacinda Ardern |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12366570 |accessdate=21 September 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=21 September 2020 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921232253/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12366570|archive-date=21 September 2020}}</ref><ref name="Radio New Zealand">{{cite news |title=Cabinet agrees to move Auckland to level 2 and rest of New Zealand to level 1 |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/426560/cabinet-agrees-to-move-auckland-to-level-2-and-rest-of-new-zealand-to-level-1 |accessdate=21 September 2020 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=21 September 2020 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200921232428/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/426560/cabinet-agrees-to-move-auckland-to-level-2-and-rest-of-new-zealand-to-level-1|archive-date=21 September 2020}}</ref> On 7 October, Auckland also moved down to level 1.<ref name="Auckland Level 1 Oct 7"/>

In October and November 2020, the horticultural and viticultural industries reported a shortage of workers since the Government's border restrictions and managed isolation requirements prevented tourists and seasonal workers from entering the country.

In addition, tourists from certain countries are allowed to work on a visitor visa. This labour shortage has caused fruits and crops to rot. Local growers have reported difficulty in recruiting locals due to the long hours, hard, outdoor work, lower wages, and them lacking the specialised picking and plant-care skills that foreign workers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=David |title=Fields of courgettes go to waste because grower can't get workers |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/fields-of-courgettes-go-to-waste-because-grower-cant-get-workers/WU663T7JRQVDDOYTBOXMA4VPIY/ |access-date=23 November 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=7 November 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201120030035/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/fields-of-courgettes-go-to-waste-because-grower-cant-get-workers/WU663T7JRQVDDOYTBOXMA4VPIY/|archive-date=20 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Immigration Minister says allowing fruit pickers into NZ to fix labour shortage 'not an option' |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/rural/2020/10/immigration-minister-says-allowing-fruit-pickers-into-nz-to-fix-labour-shortage-not-an-option.html |access-date=23 November 2020 |work=[[Newshub]] |date=7 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201017105614/https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/rural/2020/10/immigration-minister-says-allowing-fruit-pickers-into-nz-to-fix-labour-shortage-not-an-option.html|archive-date=17 October 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hall |first1=Kristin |title=Kiwi fruit pickers have simple message as growers cry out for labour – 'pay us more' |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/kiwi-fruit-pickers-have-simple-message-growers-cry-labour-pay-us-more |access-date=23 November 2020 |work=[[1 News]] |date=7 November 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/kiwi-fruit-pickers-have-simple-message-growers-cry-labour-pay-us-more|archive-date=17 November 2020}}</ref><ref name="Stuff Horticulture work really hard">{{cite news |last1=Stock |first1=Rob |title=Horticulture work 'really hard' at first, but there's decent money to be made |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/123203930/horticulture-work-really-hard-at-first-but-theres-decent-money-to-be-made |access-date=23 November 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=29 October 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201104000101/https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/123203930/horticulture-work-really-hard-at-first-but-theres-decent-money-to-be-made|archive-date=4 November 2020}}</ref>

In late August 2020 [[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] reported that several businessmen and former politicians (including former [[New Zealand National Party|National]] MP [[Ross Meurant]] and former National Party and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT party]] leader [[Don Brash]]) had sought to import Russia's insufficiently tested [[Gam-COVID-Vac]] (also known as Sputnik V) vaccine into New Zealand. They had established a company called Covax-NZR Limited and filed paperwork through the Russian Embassy to establish supply and distribution arrangements to import the vaccine. [[University of Auckland]] vaccinologist [[Helen Petousis-Harris]] warned that using untested vaccines could hurt global efforts to develop safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19.<ref>

On 12 October 2020, the Government signed an agreement with [[Pfizer]] and [[BioNTech]] to buy 1.5 million COVID-19 vaccines, which is enough for 750,000 people.

==== Media perception ====
Due to the large viewing of the daily 1&nbsp;pm press briefings, the actions of and lines of questioning from journalists came under scrutiny from the public, with many criticising repetitive or aggressive lines of questioning and "gotcha" accusations. [[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] journalist Thomas Coughlan replied that the criticism "seemed to come from nowhere" and these actions are "really the way it's always been", saying that the methodology has only come into question due to the large viewership of the press conferences.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/podcast-the-detail/the-1pm-news-scramble|title=The 1pm news scramble|first=Sharon|last=Brettkelly|work=Newsroom|date=2020-09-15|accessdate=2020-09-16}}</ref> Television producer Robyn Patterson, writing for ''[[Newsroom]]'', commented that the "aggressive stance of some local journalists ... is leading to a public backlash", which "elevates the anxiety levels of an already distressed public and creates deep unease". She noted that a 2019 [[Griffith University]] study of journalistic best practice recommended that journalists consider the needs of those impacted by disastrous events or else they risk to cause more harm than good.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newsroom.co.nz/robyn-paterson-oped|title=The watchdog role of our journalists|first=Robyn|last=Patterson|website=Newsroom|date=2020-09-05|accessdate=2020-09-16}}</ref>

!Description and Measures
|-
!<big>1</big>
|Prepare
|COVID-19 is uncontrolled overseas. The disease is contained in New Zealand and there are sporadic imported cases, but isolated household transmission could be occurring.

*Border entry measures to minimise risk of importing COVID-19 cases.
*Intensive testing for COVID-19.
*Rapid [[contact tracing]] of any positive case.
*People arriving in New Zealand without symptoms of COVID-19 go into a managed [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] facility for at least 14 days.<ref name="MOH_MI&Q">{{cite web|date=3 July 2020|title=COVID-19 – Managed isolation and quarantine|url=https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-border-controls/covid-19-managed-isolation-and-quarantine|accessdate=10 July 2020|publisher=Ministry of Health}}</ref>
*People arriving in New Zealand with symptoms of COVID-19 or who test positive after arrival go into a quarantine facility and are unable to leave their room for at least 14 days.<ref name="MOH_MI&Q" />
*Mandatory [[Isolation (health care)|self-isolation]] may be applied.
*Schools and workplaces are open, and must operate safely.
*No restrictions on personal movement or gatherings.
*Stay home if you are sick, report flu-like symptoms.
*Wash and dry hands, cough into elbow, do not touch your face.
*No restrictions on domestic transport – avoid public transport or travel if sick.
*Businesses and public transport must display QR codes to allow for contact tracing.
|-
!<big>2</big>
|Reduce
|The disease is contained, but the risk of community transmission remains. Household transmission could be occurring, and there are single or isolated cluster outbreaks.

*People can connect with friends and family, go shopping, or travel domestically, but should follow public health guidance.
*Physical distancing of two metres from people you do not know when out in public is recommended, with one metre physical distancing in controlled environments like workplaces unless other measures are in place.
*No more than 100 people at indoor or outdoor gatherings (subject to any lower limit, e.g. fire regulations).
*Sport and recreation activities are allowed, subject to conditions on gatherings, contact tracing, and – where practical – physical distancing.
*Public venues can open but must comply with public health measures.
*Health and disability care services operate as normally as possible.
*Businesses can open to the public, but must follow public health guidance including in relation to physical distancing and contact tracing. Alternative ways of working encouraged where possible (e.g. remote working, shift-based working, physical distancing, staggering meal breaks, flexible leave).
*Schools, early childhood education and tertiary education providers can open with appropriate public health measures in place.
*People at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (e.g. those with underlying medical conditions, especially if not well controlled, and seniors) are encouraged to take additional precautions when leaving home. They may work, if they agree with their employer that they can do so safely.
*Face coverings are required on public transport and aircraft, but not school buses or Cook Strait ferries. children under 12 are exempt along with passengers in taxis or rideshare services and people with disabilities or mental health conditions.
|-
!<big>3</big>
|Restrict
|There is a high risk the disease is not contained. Community transmission might be happening. New clusters may emerge but can be controlled through testing and contact tracing.

*People instructed to stay home in their [[support bubble]] other than for essential personal movement – including to go to work, school if they have to or for local recreation. 
*Physical distancing of two metres outside home (including on public transport), or one metre In controlled environments like schools and workplaces.
*People must stay within their immediate household bubble, but can expand this to reconnect with close family / whānau, or bring in caregivers, or support isolated people. This extended bubble should remain exclusive.
*Schools (years 1 to 10) and Early Childhood Education centres can safely open, but will have limited capacity. Children should learn at home if possible.
*People must work from home unless that is not possible.
*Businesses can open premises, but cannot physically interact with customers.
*Low risk local recreation activities are allowed.
*Public venues are closed (e.g. libraries, museums, cinemas, food courts, gyms, pools, playgrounds, markets).
*Gatherings of up to 10 people are allowed but only for wedding services, funerals and tangihanga. Physical distancing and public health measures must be maintained.
*Healthcare services use virtual, non-contact consultations where possible.
*Inter-regional travel is highly limited (e.g. for essential workers, with limited exemptions for others).
*People at high risk of severe illness (older people and those with existing medical conditions) are encouraged to stay at home where possible, and take additional precautions when leaving home. They may choose to continue to work.
|-
!<big>4</big>
|Eliminate
|It is likely the disease is not contained. Sustained and intensive community transmission is occurring, and there are widespread outbreaks and new clusters.

* People must stay at home (in their bubble) other than for essential personal movement.
* Safe recreational activity is allowed in local area.
* Travel is severely limited.
* All gatherings cancelled and all public venues closed.
* Businesses closed except for [[COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand#Essential services|essential services]] (e.g. supermarkets, pharmacies, clinics, petrol stations) and [[Lifeline utility|lifeline utilities]].
* Educational facilities closed.
* Rationing of supplies and requisitioning of facilities possible.
* Reprioritisation of healthcare services.

====Maritime travel breaches====
In late September, it was reported that three German yachties had defied New Zealand's COVID-19 laws by sailing from [[Tahiti]] to [[Opua]], [[Northland Region|Northland]] despite having their application for a border exemption denied by [[Immigration New Zealand]]. After being tested and quarantined on their vessel for 14 days, the three returned to Germany on 1 October and are subject to a travel ban from New Zealand. While Immigration New Zealand defended their decision, Rear Commodore Guy Chester of the Ocean Cruising Club expressed concerns about the plight of hundreds of yachties stranded in the Pacific, who were unable to dock in New Zealand and Australia due to COVID-19 border restrictions.<ref>{{cite news |title=German yachties had 'blatant disregard' for New Zealand law - Immigration NZ |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/427031/german-yachties-had-blatant-disregard-for-new-zealand-law-immigration-nz |accessdate=29 September 2020 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=27 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929081859/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/427031/german-yachties-had-blatant-disregard-for-new-zealand-law-immigration-nz|archive-date=29 September 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=German yachties jailed until flight on Thursday after being refused entry into NZ |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/german-yachties-jailed-until-flight-thursday-after-being-refused-entry-into-nz |accessdate=29 September 2020 |work=[[1 News]] |date=29 September 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929074405/https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/german-yachties-jailed-until-flight-thursday-after-being-refused-entry-into-nz |archivedate=29 September 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Orsman |first1=Bernard |title=Covid 19 coronavirus: German crew who entered NZ unlawfully have flown home |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12369970 |accessdate=2 October 2020 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=2 October 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20201002083638/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12369970 |archivedate=2 October 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Support bubble ==
[[File:Covid-19-Bubble-spread-02-1.gif|thumb|right|200px|The support bubble concept]]
Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, New Zealand launched the support bubble concept.<ref>[https://thespinoff.co.nz/covid-19/01-04-2020/siouxsie-wiles-toby-morris-why-those-bubbles-are-so-important/ Siouxsie Wiles & Toby Morris: Why those bubbles are so important]</ref>
A bubble is defined as a group of people with whom you have close physical contact. People in a bubble do not have to practice social distancing from others within the same bubble. The entire bubble counts as one household.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52637354 ]</ref><ref>[https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/05/new-zealand-quarantine-bubble-concept-america.html ]</ref><ref>[https://theconversation.com/quarantine-bubbles-when-done-right-limit-coronavirus-risk-and-help-fight-loneliness-140134 ]</ref>

In early March 2020, there were concerns about COVID-19 tests being given only to people with symptoms who had returned from impacted countries or people who had been in contact with a confirmed case.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Morton|first=Jamie|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12313924|title=Coronavirus testing: Five questions answered|date=5 March 2020|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|access-date=14 March 2020|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200305014210/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12313924|archive-date=5 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Some people with symptoms but who did not fit these categories were not tested.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/120277695/coronavirus-auckland-mums-request-to-be-tested-for-virus-rejected|title=Coronavirus: Auckland mum's request to be tested for virus rejected|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=14 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314171609/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/120277695/coronavirus-auckland-mums-request-to-be-tested-for-virus-rejected|archive-date=14 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 18 August, [[Newshub]] reported that a senior quarantine official had revealed that quarantine workers had requested a regular testing "regime" multiple times but their concerns were ignored. While Prime Minister Ardern had initially claimed that some workers were reluctant, Health Minister Chris Hipkins acknowledged that he was aware that the testing of border staff was incomplete during a briefing, stating that "they should not have been declined tests."
