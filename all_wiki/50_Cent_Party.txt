A 2016 [[Harvard University]] paper found that in contrast to common assumptions, the 50 Cent Army consists mostly of paid bureaucrats who respond to government directives and rarely defend their government from criticism or engage in direct arguments. Around 80% of the analysed posts involve pro-China cheerleading with inspirational slogans, and 13% involve general praise and suggestions on governmental policies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=King|first1=Gary|last2=Pan|first2=Jennifer|last3=Roberts|first3=Margaret E.|date=2017|title=How the Chinese Government Fabricates Social Media Posts for Strategic Distraction, Not Engaged Argument|url=https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/how_the_chinese_government_fabricates_social_media_posts_for_strategic_distraction_not_engaged_argument.pdf|journal=American Political Science Review|language=en|volume=111|issue=3|pages=484–501|doi=10.1017/S0003055417000144|issn=0003-0554|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="Wertime" />

Research indicated a "massive secretive operation" to fill China's Internet with propaganda has resulted in some 488 million posts carried out by fake social media accounts, representing about 0.6% of the 80 billion posts generated on Chinese social media. To maximize their influence, such pro-government comments are made largely during times of intense online debate, and when [[Internet activism|online protest]]s have a possibility of transforming into real life actions.<ref name="Wertime"/>

==History==
In October 2004, the Publicity Department of [[Changsha]] started hiring Internet commentators, in one of the earliest known uses of professional Internet commentators.<ref name="commentators" /><ref name="changshaxuanchuan"/>

In March 2005, the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China]] enacted a systematic censorship of Chinese college bulletin board systems. The popular "Little Lily" BBS, run by [[Nanjing University]], was forced to close. As a new system was prepared to be launched, school officials hired students as part-time web commentators, paid from the university's work-study funds, to search the forum for undesirable information and actively counter it with Party-friendly viewpoints. In the following months, party leaders from [[Jiangsu]] began hiring their own teams.<ref name="feer"/> By mid-2007, web commentator teams recruited by schools, and party organizations were common across China. [[Shanghai Normal University]] employed undergraduates to monitor for signs of dissent and post on university forums.<ref name="nyt"/> These commentators not only operate within political discussions, but also in general discussions.<ref name="feer" /><ref name=nyt /> Afterwards, some schools and local governments also started to build similar teams.<ref name="sohu"/><ref name="guoluo"/><ref name="t20090729_791744"/>

On 23 January 2007, Chinese leader [[Hu Jintao]] demanded a "reinforcement of ideological and public opinion front construction and positive publicity" at the 38th collective learning of [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]].<ref name="xinhuanet"/> Large Chinese websites and local governments have been requested to publish the sayings of Hu, and select "comrades with good political quality" to form "teams of Internet commentators" by the [[CCP Central Committee]] ({{lang|zh|中共中央办公厅}}) and [[General Office of the State Council]] ({{lang|zh|国务院办公厅}}).<ref name="feer" /><ref name="dwnews"/>

Negative reporting of local authorities has increased on the Internet since then.<ref name="cdt"/> In one instance described on the [[China Digital Times]], the [[Jiaozuo]] (Henan) City [[Public Security Bureau]] established a mechanism to analyse public opinion after criticism of the police handling of a traffic incident appeared on the Internet. The Bureau responded with 120 staff calling for the truth to be revealed in line with the public opinion, which gradually shifted and eventually supported the police position, denouncing the original poster.<ref name=cdt/><ref name=zhong /> In the aftermath of the [[2008 Weng'an riot|2008 Guizhou riot]], Internet forums were filled with posts critical of the local authorities; the ''[[China News Weekly]]'' later reported that "the major task of the propaganda group was to organize commentators to past [sic] posts on websites to guide online public opinions."<ref name=zhong />

In 2010, the Shanghai [[Communist Youth League of China|Communist Youth League]]'s official website published a summary, saying that there were more than 200 topics by Shanghai Municipal Authorities' Internet commentators posted at [[People's Daily]] site, [[Xinhua]] site, Eastday (东方网), [[Sina.com|Sina]] and [[Tianya Club|Tianya]] after many incidents in 2009, including the [[Lotus Riverside]] incident, the forced installation of [[Green Dam Youth Escort]] software, the [[Putuo District, Shanghai|Putuo]] [[City Urban Administrative and Law Enforcement Bureau|Urban Administrative]] incident, the control of [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1]], the Shanghai entrapment incident ([[:zh:钓鱼执法|钓鱼执法]]), the [[self-immolation]] of Pan Rong (潘蓉), etc. It was praised by the Shanghai Internet Publicity Office.<ref name="shy"/>

In December 2014, a Chinese blogger hacked into and published email archives for the Internet Propaganda Department of [[Zhanggong District]] in [[Ganzhou]], including over 2,700 emails of 50 Cent Party Internet commentators.<ref>[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2014/12/thousands-local-internet-propaganda-emails-leaked/ Thousands of Local Internet Propaganda Emails Leaked] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102024152/http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2014/12/thousands-local-internet-propaganda-emails-leaked/ |date=2 January 2015 }}, China Digital Times, 3 December 2014.</ref><ref>[http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2014/12/zhanggong-leaks-history-best-judge/ Zhanggong Leaks: History is the Best Judge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102012726/http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2014/12/zhanggong-leaks-history-best-judge/ |date=2 January 2015 }}, China Digital Times, 10 December 2014.</ref> For instance, on 16 January 2014, Shi Wenqing, secretary of the Ganzhou branch of the CCP, held a televised "Internet exchange" in which he answered questions from a local news website forum; 50 Cent Party commentators were instructed to post seven discussion points, such as (translated) "I really admire Party Secretary Shi, what a capable and effective Party Secretary! I hope he can be the father of Ganzhou for years to come."<ref>[http://qz.com/311832/hacked-emails-reveal-chinas-elaborate-and-absurd-internet-propaganda-machine/ Hacked emails reveal China’s elaborate and absurd internet propaganda machine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101165227/http://qz.com/311832/hacked-emails-reveal-chinas-elaborate-and-absurd-internet-propaganda-machine/ |date=1 January 2015 }}, Quartz, 18 December 2014.</ref>

==Range of operation==
The [[Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China]] now holds regular training sessions, where participants are required to pass an exam after which they are issued a job certification.<ref name="feer"/> As of 2008, the total number of 50-cent operatives was estimated to be in the tens of thousands,<ref name="BBC1"/> and possibly as high as 280,000–300,000.<ref name="feer"/><ref name="tw"/> Every large Chinese website is instructed by the Information Office to create a trained team of Internet commentators.<ref name="feer" />

According to the ''Chinese Communists' opinions of the recruitment of university Work Committee (tentative)'', the university Internet commentators are mainly selected from [[en cadre|cadres]] or student cadres at Communist Party Publicity Department of universities, Youth League, Office of Academic Affairs, Network Center, Admissions Employment Department, Political Theory Department, Teaching Department and other units.<ref name="gaoxiaozhaopin"/>

The court of [[Qinghe District, Huai'an|Qinghe District]], Huai'an organized a team of 12 commentators.<ref name="huaian"/> [[Gansu|Gansu Province]] hired 650 commentators, sorted by their writing abilities.<ref name="sina"/> Suqian Municipal Publicity Department's first 26 commentators' team were reported by ''[[Yangtse Evening Post]]'' in April 2005.<ref name="su"/> According to high-profile [[Independent (politician)|independent]] Chinese blogger Li Ming, the pro-Chinese government web commentators must number "at least in the tens of thousands".<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

[[Wen Yunchao]] ([[:zh:温云超|温云超]]), a former Internet commentator said that there were about 20 full-time commentators for the local news websites in [[Guangdong]]. A county-level discipline inspection commission's Internet commentator estimated more than 100 spare-time Internet commentators in his county, whose population was about 1 million. Hu Yong, an Internet expert from [[Peking University]], said that "the public opinion molders have already penetrated different layers of Chinese society", he found public opinion watchmen that deal with negative information on the forums in tourist city's airport and county-level middle school.<ref name="commentators" /> A 2016 [[Harvard University|Harvard]] study estimated that the group posts about 488 million [[social media]] comments per year.<ref>{{cite news|title=China 'flooding' social media with fake posts (20 May 2016)|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36340514|accessdate=22 May 2016|work=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522133327/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36340514|archive-date=22 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to an article published by [[Xiao Qiang]] on his website [[China Digital Times]], a leaked propaganda directive, sent to 50 Cent Party Internet commentators, stated their objective was the following:<ref name="chinadigitaltimes1"/><ref name="chinadigitaltimes2"/>
<blockquote>
In order to circumscribe the influence of Taiwanese democracy, in order to progress further in the work of guiding public opinion, and in accordance with the requirements established by higher authorities to "be strategic, be skilled," we hope that internet commentators conscientiously study the mindset of netizens, grasp international developments, and better perform the work of being an internet commentator. For this purpose, this notice is promulgated as set forth below:

:(1) To the extent possible make America the target of criticism. Play down the existence of Taiwan.
:(2) Do not directly confront [the idea of] democracy; rather, frame the argument in terms of "what kind of system can truly implement democracy.”
:(3) To the extent possible, choose various examples in [[Western countries]] of violence and unreasonable circumstances to explain how democracy is not well-suited to capitalism.
:(4) Use America's and other countries' interference in [[international relations|international affairs]] to explain how [[Western democracy]] is actually an invasion of other countries and [how the West] is forcibly pushing [on other countries] Western values.
:(5) Use the bloody and tear-stained history of a [once] weak people [i.e., China] to stir up pro-Party and patriotic emotions.
:(6) Increase the exposure that positive developments inside China receive; further accommodate the work of maintaining [social] stability.<ref name="chinadigitaltimes1"/><ref name="chinadigitaltimes2"/>
</blockquote>

==Salary==
The English version of China-based ''[[Global Times]]'' reported that Changsha Publicity Department's Internet commentators were paid 0.5 yuan per post, which is considered as the origin of the term "50 Cent Party". However, according to the local party-building website, the basic salary of such commentators was 600 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] in 2006.<ref name="commentators" /><ref name="changshaxuanchuan" />

In 2010, the Internet commentators from [[Hengyang]] Municipal Committee Party School were paid 0.1 yuan per post and less than 100 yuan monthly bonus.<ref name="hydjnet"/><ref name="cenews"/>

A county-level discipline inspection commission's Internet commentator from Hunan Province told ''Global Times'' that a 500-word article is worth 40 yuan on local websites and 200 yuan on national sites.<ref name="commentators" />{{Deprecated source}}

Those who made excellent incitement are honoured as excellent critics from the government.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/comments/2008-01/09/content_7382996.htm |title=新华网2007年度优秀网评人评选揭晓 |access-date=24 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113091751/http://news.xinhuanet.com/comments/2008-01/09/content_7382996.htm |archive-date=13 January 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Among those names, "50 Cent Party" (五毛党) was the most common and pejorative unofficial term.<ref name="China's plan to use internet for propaganda"/> It was created by Chinese [[netizen]]s as a satire. Many trace the origin of the "50-cent" name to the salaries at the Publicity Department of [[Changsha]], which according to the English version of ''[[Global Times]]'', supplemented Internet Commentators' basic income with 50 cents ("5 mao")<ref group="note" name="mao">"{{lang|zh|毛}}" ({{zh|p=máo}}) is a colloquial term for "[[Jiao (currency)|jiao]]", a unit of the [[renminbi]] which equals ¥0.10.</ref> per post since October 2004.<ref name="commentators"/>

The term is applied by Chinese netizens to any person who blatantly expresses pro-[[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] thoughts online.<ref name="dnai" /> However, there's another word "5 US cent (五美分)" used by some netizens to denigrate anti-party comments, with the implication that those commentators are hired by the governments of the United States, Taiwan or other [[Western world#Modern political|western countries]]. Zhang Shengjun, a professor of international politics at [[Beijing Normal University]] published an article ''Who would be afraid of the cap of "50 Cent Party"?'' on the Chinese version of ''Global Times'', saying that the term is spread by western media outfits, "it has become a baton waved towards all Chinese patriots" to make the Chinese government a constant target of criticism.<ref name="commentators"/>

According to ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', Chinese cyberspace is also noted for its ideological contests between "rightists" - reformists who advocate Western style democratic reforms, versus "leftists" - conservatives and neo-Confucianists who advocates Chinese nationalism and restructured socialism. In this backdrop, rightists sometimes refer to leftists derogatorily as "50 Centers", regardless of their actual employment background.<ref name="Wertime"/>

The Hong Kong-based ''[[Apple Daily]]'' reported that although a search for "五毛党" ("50 Cent Party" in Chinese) on a search engine produces results, most were inaccessible and had been deleted.<ref name="AppleDailycommentators"/>

==Effects and opinions==
The Internet commentator/50 Cent Party's activities were described by CCP general secretary, Chinese President [[Hu Jintao]], as "a new pattern of public-opinion guidance";<ref name="radioau" /><ref name="cmp" /> they represent a shift from simply erasing dissenting opinions to guiding dialogue. In 2010, a contributor to ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' stated that some comments she received on one of her posts were from the 50 Cent Party;<ref name="Usha" /> she also stated that the 50 Cent Party monitors popular US websites, news sites and blogs and posts comments that advance Chinese governmental interests.<ref name="Usha" />

David Wertime of ''Foreign Policy'' argued that the narrative where a large army of paid Internet commentators are behind China's poor public dialogue with its critics is "Orwellian, yet strangely comforting". Rather, many of the Chinese netizens spreading nationalist sentiment online are not paid, but often mean what they say.<ref name="Wertime"/>

"Wumao", the Chinese pronunciation of the term, has been picked up as an insult by English speakers against people with perceived pro-CCP or [[Pro-China|pro-Chinese]] views,<ref name=":1" /> and has been cited in discussions of [[Anti-Chinese sentiment|Sinophobia]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bertie Vidgen|url=http://zenodo.org/record/3816667/files/hs_AsianPrejudice_Codebook_vShare.pdf?download=1|title=Annotation Codebook for East Asian Prejudice (part of a paper titled: Detecting East Asian Prejudice on Social Media)|last2=Matt Hall|last3=Ella Guest|year=2020|location=[[The Alan Turing Institute]], [[Oxford Internet Institute]], [[University of Surrey]]|pages=13}}</ref> An analyst at the [[Wilson Center]] has noted that [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] are more likely to be called wumao than other groups of people in the [[English-speaking world]]; she attributed some of this to racism.<ref name=":2" /> In [[Australia]], the term has been used derogatively in the ongoing debate over Chinese influence in the country.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-44516301 |title=Is racism worsening Australia's China influence row? |last=Marshallsea |first=Trevor |date=22 June 2018 |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=23 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180622190750/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-44516301 |archive-date=22 June 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>
