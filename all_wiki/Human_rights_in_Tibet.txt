==Human rights in pre-1950 Tibet==

===The social system===
{{Main|Serfdom in Tibet controversy}}
To journalist and writer [[Israel Epstein]], a [[Polish Jew]], naturalized Chinese citizen, and member of the Chinese Communist Party, "the old society" in Tibet "had nothing even remotely resembling human rights." He explains:  "High and low, the belief had for centuries been enforced on the Tibetans that everyone's status was predetermined by fate, as a reward for virtues or penalty for faults on one's past incarnations. Hence it was deemed senseless for the rich (even though compassion was abstractly preached) to have qualms about sitting on the necks of the poor, and both criminal and blasphemous for the poor not to patiently bear the yoke. ‘Shangri-La’ the old Tibet was definitely not."<ref>Epstein, Israel, [https://archive.org/details/mychinaeyememoir00epst ''My China Eye: memoirs of a Jew and a journalist''], Long River Press, 2005, 358 p., p. 277 {{ISBN|1-59265-042-2}}.</ref>

An ancient form of slavery preceding the development of the feudal system, was still extant in a small number of manors in old Tibet (prior to 1959): the ''nanggzan'' manors (''nanggzan'' meaning "family slave" in Tibetan). In these, according to Chinese sociologist Liu Zhong, "exploitation was not through land-rent but through enslavement" to the manor's owner. In return for working the land, the slaves were provided with lodging, clothing and food, albeit minimal. "Some slaves had their families [with them]  while others did not." This residual form of slavery was finally abolished in Central Tibet in 1959 by the Preparatory Committee for the Founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region.<ref>Liu Zhong, [http://bic.cass.cn/English/InfoShow/Arcitle_Show_Forum2_Show.asp?ID=260&Title=The%20Humanities%20Study&strNavigation=Home-%3EForum-%3ENationalities&BigClassID=4&SmallClassID=8 On the K'ralpa Manors of Tibet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724021653/http://bic.cass.cn/English/InfoShow/Arcitle_Show_Forum2_Show.asp?ID=260&Title=The%20Humanities%20Study&strNavigation=Home-%3EForum-%3ENationalities&BigClassID=4&SmallClassID=8 |date=2011-07-24 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724021653/http://bic.cass.cn/English/InfoShow/Arcitle_Show_Forum2_Show.asp?ID=260&Title=The%20Humanities%20Study&strNavigation=Home-%3EForum-%3ENationalities&BigClassID=4&SmallClassID=8 |date=2011-07-24 }}, ''The Humanities Study'', 2003-5-23.</ref>

The nature of [[serfdom]] and its applicability to Eastern societies is contested amongst academics. Tibetologist [[Melvyn Goldstein]] wrote in 1971 that "Tibet was characterized by a form of institutionalized inequality that can be called pervasive serfdom".<ref name="Goldstein, 1971, pp. 521-34">Goldstein, ''Journal of Asian Studies'', May 1971, pp. 521-34.</ref> However some academics have questioned the applicability of the concept to Tibet, a recent example being {{ill|Heidi Fjeld|no|vertical-align=sup}} who in 2003 argued that [[feudalism]] and the use of the term 'serf' was misleading in relation to the social system of Tibet and instead described it as "a caste-like social hierarchy".<ref>{{cite book|last=Fjeld|first=Heidi|title=Commoners and Nobles:Hereditary Divisions in Tibet|publisher=Nordic Institute of Asian Studies|year=2003|page=5|isbn=978-87-91114-17-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g0V5lV_M-SYC|access-date=2015-11-15|archive-date=2020-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823230736/https://books.google.com/books?id=g0V5lV_M-SYC|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the political debate concerning the legitimacy of Communist Party rule in the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]], official Chinese sources assert that the Communist invasion was justified in order to end the practice of "feudal serfdom" and other alleged [[human rights]] abuses under the Dalai Lama.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zt.tibet.cn/tibetzt/question_e/1/menu.htm|title=100 Questions and Answers About Tibet|publisher=China Tibet Information Center|access-date=2008-06-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060331121008/http://zt.tibet.cn/tibetzt/question_e/1/menu.htm|archive-date=2006-03-31|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Tibetan Government in Exile and supporters of the free Tibet movement contend that efforts had been underway in the first half of the 20th century to modernise the country, and argue that human rights abuses under the Communist Party have inflicted greater suffering and repression of the [[Tibetan people]].<ref>Human Rights by the Tibetan Government in Exile http://tibet.net/en/index.php?id=149&rmenuid=11 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612013359/http://tibet.net/en/index.php?id=149&rmenuid=11 |date=2010-06-12 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612013359/http://tibet.net/en/index.php?id=149&rmenuid=11 |date=2010-06-12 }}</ref><ref>Why Tibet?

===Crimes and punishments===
Trader Gyebo Sherpa was subjected to the severe ''corca'' whipping for selling cigarettes. He died from his wounds 2 days later in the Potala prison.<ref>Melvyn C. Goldstein, ''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State'', London/Berkeley, University of California Press, 1989, p. 163.</ref> Tashi Tsering, a self-described critic of traditional Tibetan society, records being whipped as a 13-year-old for missing a performance as a dancer in the Dalai Lama's dance troop in 1942, until the skin split and the pain became excruciating.<ref>Goldstein, Tsering, and Siebenschuh, 1997, pp. 3-5.</ref>

Yet, incidents of mutilation have been recorded in Tibet in the period between the start of the 20th Century and the Chinese occupation. Tibetan communist Phuntso Wangye recalled his anger at seeing freshly severed human ears hanging from the gate of the county headquarters in Damshung north of Lhasa in 1945.<ref>Goldstein, Sherap, Siebenschuh 2004 p. 90.</ref> The top level Tibetan official [[Lungshar]]'s eyes were gouged out by direct order of the Kashag or Tibetan Government was carried out in 1934.<ref name="GoldHist208">A History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951, Melvyn C. Goldstein pp. 208-209</ref> An attempt was made at anesthetizing the alleged criminal with intoxicants before performing the punishment, which unfortunately did not work well.<ref name="GoldHist208" />

In 1950, the six Tibetan border guards that had been involved in the killing or wounding of [[Frank Bessac]]'s companions (one of them [[Douglas Mackiernan]]) as they were fleeing into Tibet from the Communist advance, were tried and sentenced to mutilation in Lhasa's military court: "The leader was to have his nose and both ears cut off. The man who fired the first shot was to lose both ears. A third man was to lose one ear, and the others were to get 50 lashes each." (The punishment was subsequently changed to lashings on Bessac's request).<ref>These Tibetans killed an American... and get the lash for it. This was the perilous trek to tragedy by Frank Bessac, as told to James Burke, Time-Life correspondent in New Delhi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8ksEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA130&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Life''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502004248/https://books.google.com/books?id=8ksEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA130&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false |date=2016-05-02 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502004248/https://books.google.com/books?id=8ksEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA130&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false |date=2016-05-02 }}, November 1950, pp. 130-136: "Just before we left Lhasa, I was told that the six border guards had been tried and sentenced in Lhasa's military court. The leader was to have his nose and both ears cut off. The man who fired the first shot was to lose both ears. A third man was to lose one ear, and the others were to get 50 lashes each. (...) Since the Tibetan Buddhists do not believe in capital punishment, mutilation is the stiffest sentence given in Tibet. But I felt that this punishment was too severe, so I asked if it could be lightened. My request was granted. The new sentences were: 200 lashes each for the leader and the man who fired the first shot, 50 lashes for the third man and 25 each for the other.''</ref>

===Hostility to Western missions and churches===
Western missionaries, in past centuries, took the perilous and time-consuming journey to Tibet, only to be frustrated by the poor number of native converts, to be expelled from the area, or even to be killed or to die. But at different stages of Tibetan history secular rulers and religious leaders such as the [[Dalai Lama]] have been eager to protect Western [[missionaries]] and their tasks of [[preaching]] [[Christian beliefs]] to the local [[Tibetans]]. The first Western [[missionary]] known to have reached [[Lhasa]] was the [[Jesuit]] Father [[Antonio de Andrade]], accompanied by Fratello Manuel Marques, and their first encounter with the Tibetans was cordial, with the Tibetans greeting Andrade and Marques with friendliness.<ref name="Hsiao-ting Lin"/>

However, Christians endured a number of persecutions in old Tibet. In 1630, the [[Tsaparang]] Jesuit mission in the [[Guge]]  Kingdom (presently the [[Gantok]] district of West Tibet) fell victim to an uprising by dissident local Yellow Hat lamas, led by the king's brother and abetted by the king of [[Ladakh]], against the King who had lavished favours on the alien mission. Many Christian converts were carried off by force to Ladakh as slaves. The church and properties at Tsaparang and [[Rudok]] were sacked, and five resident Jesuits became virtual prisoners of the king of Ladakh who had become the de facto ruler of Guge.
A 1640 effort to reestablish the mission in Guge collapsed when a party of three new priests was attacked as it entered Tibet before reaching Tsaparang and was forced to retreat to India.<ref name="Hsiao-ting Lin">Hsiao-ting Lin, [http://usf.usfca.edu/pac_rim/new/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html ''When Christianity and Lamaism Met: The Changing Fortunes of Early Western Missionaries in Tibet''] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120715115605/http://usf.usfca.edu/pac_rim/new/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html|date=2012-07-15}} {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120715115605/http://usf.usfca.edu/pac_rim/new/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html|date=2012-07-15}}, esp. chapters « Christianity and Tibetan Politics » and « The Fate of Western Missionaries in Tibet ».</ref>

Between 1850 and 1880, after the Qing court's decree allowing Western missionaries to purchase lands and construct churches in Chinese provinces, as many as a dozen lower ranking priests of the Paris Foreign Mission Society were killed or injured during their journeys to missionary outposts in the Sino-Tibetan borderlands. In 1881, Father Brieux, then head of the Paris Foreign Mission Society in [[Batang, Batang County|Batang]] in eastern Tibet, was reported to have been murdered on his way to Lhasa. After proper investigations, Qing officials discovered that the murder cases were covertly supported and even orchestrated by local lamaseries and native chieftains. Feeling threatened by the increasing number of new Christian converts in eastern Tibet, as well as by the imperial decree allowing the missionaries to openly purchase and possess land, the lamaistic monastic communities and their political patrons felt the need to take drastic measures to secure their religious, financial, and political interests.<ref name="Hsiao-ting Lin" />

In 1904, Qing official Feng Quan sought to curtail the influence of the Gelugpa Sect and ordered the protection of Western missionaries and their churches. Indignation over Feng Quan and the Christian presence escalated to a climax in March 1905, when thousands of the Batang lamas revolted, killing Feng, his entourage, local Manchu and Han Chinese officials, and the local French Catholic priests. The revolt soon spread to other cities in eastern Tibet, such as Chamdo, Litang and Nyarong, and at one point almost spilled over into neighboring Sichuan Province. The missionary stations and churches in these areas were burned and destroyed by the angry Gelugpa monks and local chieftains. Dozens of local Westerners, including at least four priests, were killed or fatally wounded. The scale of the rebellion was so tremendous that only when panicked Qing authorities hurriedly sent 2,000 troops from Sichuan to pacify the mobs did the revolt gradually come to an end. The lamasery authorities and local native chieftains' hostility towards the Western missionaries in Tibet lingered through the last throes of the Manchu dynasty and into the Republican period.<ref>Hsiao-ting Lin, [http://usf.usfca.edu/pac_rim/new/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html ''When Christianity and Lamaism Met: The Changing Fortunes of Early Western Missionaries in Tibet''] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120715115605/http://usf.usfca.edu/pac_rim/new/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html |date=2012-07-15 }} {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120715115605/http://usf.usfca.edu/pac_rim/new/research/pacrimreport/pacrimreport36.html |date=2012-07-15 }}</ref><ref>Alex McKay (ed), ''The History of Tibet'', London: RoutledgeCurzon (2003), p640-1,643 Christian missionaries banned.</ref>

According to Hsiao-ting Lin, it was neither 'anti-imperialism' nor 'patriotism' – contrary to what is asserted by the 'standard' Chinese historical narratives – that led the Tibetans to expel the Western missionaries, but "the fact that Tibetan religious and political figures were desperate to prevent any possible intrusion into their local interests and privileges by Christian authorities."<ref name="Hsiao-ting Lin" />

===Reform===
According to supporters of the Tibetan Government in Exile, in his reforms the 13th Dalai Lama banned capital punishment, making Tibet one of the first countries to do so.<ref name="acme">{{cite web|url=http://www.tibetwrites.org/?Acme-of-Obscenity |title=Acme of Obscenity |access-date=2010-03-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704094653/http://www.tibetwrites.org/?Acme-of-Obscenity |archive-date=July 4, 2010 }}</ref><ref name="tibet.ca">{{Cite web |url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=2005&m=10&p=11_6 |title=The third World day against Death Penalty, Jean-François Leclere |access-date=2010-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610073908/http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=2005&m=10&p=11_6 |archive-date=2011-06-10 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="La répression est féroce">Florence Perret, [http://archives.24heures.ch/VQ/LA_COTE/-/article-2008-03-2282/les-manifestations-qui-embrasent-les-regions-tibetaines-prennent-une-ampleur-jamais-vue-explique La répression est féroce]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''24 heures'' (interview with [[Katia Buffetrille]]), 26 March 2008.</ref>

This is acknowledged by [[Sir Charles Bell]], a friend of the Dalai Lama's, with the reservation, however, that "the punishment for deliberate murder is usually so severe that the convict can hardly survive for long."<ref>Charles Bell, ''Tibet Past and Present'', Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1992, 326 pages, p. 143 (1st published: 1927): "The Dalai informed me that he had not allowed any capital sentence to be inflicted since he assumed power. This no doubt is so, but the punishment for deliberate murder is usually so severe that the convict can hardly survive for long."</ref>

Also, historian [[Alex C. McKay]] notes that isolated cases of capital punishment did take place in later years, such as the death of one Padma Chandra and the execution of a youth involved in stealing the western Tibetan administrator's horse. McKay also stresses the fact that corporal punishment continued to be inflicted for numerous offences and often proved fatal.<ref>Alex McKay, Introduction, in ''The History of Tibet: the modern period: 1985–1959, the encounter with modernity'', edited by Alex McKay, RoutledgeCurzon, 2003, p. 32: "Note 2: The death penalty was abolished around 1898. Isolated cases of capital punishment did, however, take place in later years; see, for example, M. Goldstein, ''a History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951: The Demise of the Lamaist State'' (London/Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989), pp. 126-30 in regard to the death of Padma Chandra. But for an example of a more despotic kind, see Oriental and India Office Collection (hereafter OIOC), L/P&5/7/251, in regard to the execution of a youth involved in stealing the western Tibetan administrator's horse. It must not be forgotten that corporal punishment continued to be inflicted for numerous offences and often proved fatal".</ref>

==Human rights in post-1950 Tibet==

===Reforms===
The 14th Dalai Lama's brother [[Jigme Norbu]] reports that, along with these reforms, living conditions in jails were improved, with officials being designated to see that these conditions and rules were maintained."<ref>Jigme Norbu, ''Tibet is My Country'', second edition, 1987, p. 317.</ref>

In the reforms that were enacted [[1959 Tibetan uprising|after 1959]], Italian marxist philosopher [[Domenico Losurdo]] sees a chance for the Tibetan populace to access the human rights they were previously denied, besides gaining considerably improved living conditions and a significantly increased average life expectancy.<ref>Domenico Losurdo, ''Fuir l'histoire ? La révolution russe et la révolution chinoise aujourd'hui, Paris:Le temps des cerises'', 2007 : "Les réformes et la révolution ont signifié pour les masses populaires tibétaines un accès aux droits de l'homme auparavant complètement inconnus, une augmentation très forte des conditions de vie et un prolongement sensible de la durée moyenne de la vie."</ref> This contrasts the view of [[Choekyi Gyaltsen]], the 10th Panchen Lama, who criticised the situation in [[Tibet]] with a 70,000 character document that dealt with the brutal suppression of the Tibetan people during and after the [[People's Liberation Army invasion of Tibet (1950–1951)|Chinese invasion of Tibet]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.savetibet.org/campaigns/pl/10th.php |title=The 10th Panchen Lama |access-date=2011-12-12 |archive-date=2008-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123035502/http://www.savetibet.org/campaigns/pl/10th.php |url-status=dead }} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123035502/http://www.savetibet.org/campaigns/pl/10th.php |date=2008-11-23 }}</ref> In this document, he criticized the suppression that the Chinese authorities had conducted in retaliation for the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]].<ref>Hostage of Beijing: The Abduction of the Panchen Lama, Gilles Van Grasdorff, 1999, {{ISBN|978-1-86204-561-3}} [[:fr:Pétition en 70 000 caractères]]</ref>

===Difficulties===
According to an Asia Watch Committee report in 1988, the question of human rights in a minority area of the People's Republic of China is inherently difficult to research and address.<ref>Asia Watch Committee, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_aD5n_rgGqkC&pg=PA2&dq=asia+watch+human+rights+in+tibet&hl=nl&ei=8XqtS-_eMpDZ-Qbtu9y7Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false "Human Rights in Tibet"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729032425/https://books.google.com/books?id=_aD5n_rgGqkC&pg=PA2&dq=asia+watch+human+rights+in+tibet&hl=nl&ei=8XqtS-_eMpDZ-Qbtu9y7Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false |date=2016-07-29 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729032425/https://books.google.com/books?id=_aD5n_rgGqkC&pg=PA2&dq=asia+watch+human+rights+in+tibet&hl=nl&ei=8XqtS-_eMpDZ-Qbtu9y7Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false |date=2016-07-29 }}, February 1988</ref> Official sensitivity around the Tibet issue compounds the problem. Government measures to prevent information about Tibetan protests and protesters from leaving China have hindered human rights monitoring organizations from providing an adequate account of protests and their consequences, according to the CECC.<ref>CECC 2009 report, p. 270</ref>

The position of the Communist Party that any discussion of the issue by foreigners is "unacceptable interference in China's internal affairs" is itself an obstacle to scrutiny.<ref name="Asia Watch report, p. 1">Asia Watch report, p. 1</ref> The Chinese government has also linked negative remarks about human rights in Tibet with damage to Sino-American relations. This relates to questions about political prisoners, population transfer, and more, which are "hidden in secrecy," according to the report. Thus, gathering information on such subjects with regard to Tibet is a difficult undertaking.<ref name="Asia Watch report, p. 1"/>

===Types of abuses===

The security apparatus has employed torture and degrading treatment in dealing with some detainees and prisoners, according to the U.S. State Department's 2009 report.<ref name=usstate2009/> Tibetans repatriated from Nepal have also reportedly suffered torture, including electric shocks, exposure to cold, and severe beatings, and been forced to perform heavy physical labor.

It is said that 87,000 enemies were eliminated in the original document, and Smith believes that `eliminated’ does not necessarily mean killed.

In one case a Tibetan from Sichuan province, Paltsal Kyab, died five weeks after he had been detained by police in connection with the 2008 protests. His family was not allowed to visit him while he was detained, and received no news until being informed of his death. When claiming his body, family members found it bruised and covered with blister burns; they discovered later that he also had internal injuries, according to Amnesty International. The police told the family that he had died of an illness, though relatives claimed he was healthy when detained.<ref name=amnesty2009/>

In another case a Tibetan, Jamyang Samten, said he was given [[electric shock]]s with a [[cattle prod]], chained to a wall and hit in the stomach by a Chinese guard wearing a metal glove, and if he made a minor mistake in his [[interrogation]], he would be beaten with a chain, saying that "The way the Chinese [[torture]]d was terrifying, they beat us using their full strength. Sometimes they forced us to take off our clothes. We were locked up in a room with our arms and legs handcuffed and they beat us. The chain injured the surface but not the inside of the body. If they hit us with the [[Electric shock baton|electric baton]], our entire body trembled and gradually we were unable to speak." Jamyang Samten was eventually released and [[Tibetans in exile|fled]] to [[Kathmandu]] in Nepal.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

====Allegations of physical genocide====
According to Friends of Tibet, an organization that defines itself as a "people's movement for an Independent Tibet", the number of Tibetans killed after the Chinese occupation—a period marked by torture and starvation—now exceeds a million.<ref name="friendsoftibet.org"/> The 14th Dalai Lama has alleged that 1.2&nbsp;million Tibetans were killed under Chinese rule.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/4152353.stm Regions and territories: Tibet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422064415/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/4152353.stm |date=2011-04-22 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422064415/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/4152353.stm |date=2011-04-22 }}, ''BBC''.</ref>

In her book “People who Count” (1995), Dorothy Stein indicates just how the deaths for which the Chinese are held responsible were arrived at by “Tibetan nationalists” (her words): “they are attributed to ‘figures published by the Information Office of the Central Tibetan Secretariat' in India.” "A letter to Tibetan Review by Jampel Senge (April, 1989, p. 22) says 'The census which resulted in the figure of 1.2 was conducted by the Government in Exile through exiled Tibetans who travelled to meet their relations, and through new arrivals from Tibet."<ref>Dorothy Stein, ''People Who Count. Population and Politics, Women and Children'', Earthscan Publications, London, 1995, XI + 239 p.</ref>

The figure of 1.2&nbsp;million dead is challenged by Chinese demographer Yan Hao who says that the methodoloy used by the TGIE is defective. “How can they come to these exact death figures by analysing documents,” he questions, “if they have problems in working out an exact figure of Tibet’s total population alive at present?” “How can they break down the figures by regions” “when they have a problem in clearly defining the boundary of the greater Tibet as well as its provinces?” Yan Hao stresses that “knowledge of statistics tells us that random sampling is necessary for acquiring reliable data in any surveys” and “those conducted entirely among political refugees could produce anything but objective and unbiased results.”<ref>Yan Hao (Institute of Economic Research, State Department of Planning Commission, Beijing), [http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/booksAndPapers/tibetan.population.in.china.pdf Tibetan Population in China: Myths and Facts Re-examined] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514232604/http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/booksAndPapers/tibetan.population.in.china.pdf |date=2011-05-14 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514232604/http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/booksAndPapers/tibetan.population.in.china.pdf |date=2011-05-14 }}, pp. 19-20.</ref>

Patrick French, the former director of Free Tibet Campaign in London, states that there is "no evidence" to support the figure of 1.2&nbsp;million Tibetans killed as a result of Chinese rule.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/22/opinion/22french.html|title=The New York Times|work=nytimes.com|access-date=2014-06-01|date=2008-03-22|last1=French|first1=Patrick|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922221843/https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/22/opinion/22french.html|archive-date=2018-09-22|url-status=live}}</ref> He estimates that as many as half a million Tibetans died from repression and famine under Chinese rule.<ref>Patrick French, ''Tibet, Tibet: A Personal History Of A Lost Land'' (HarperCollins, 2003), p. 292.</ref>

In a « Writenet » report prepared for the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] in 2005, Professor [[Colin P. Mackerras]] writes that the claims such as that the Chinese are swamping Tibetans in their own country and that 1.2&nbsp;million Tibetans have died due to Chinese occupation should be treated with "the deepest scepticism". The figures show that since the early 1960s, the Tibetan population has been increasing, probably for the first time for centuries. What seems to follow from this is that the TGIE’s allegations of population reduction due to Chinese rule probably have some validity for the 1950s but are greatly exaggerated. However, since the 1960s, Chinese rule has had the effect of increasing the population of the Tibetans, not decreasing it, largely due to a modernization process that has improved the standard of living and lowered infant, maternity and other mortality rates.<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain/opendocpdf.pdf?docid=423ea9094 People’s Republic of China: Background paper on the situation of the Tibetan population] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014094412/http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain/opendocpdf.pdf?docid=423ea9094 |date=2012-10-14 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014094412/http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain/opendocpdf.pdf?docid=423ea9094 |date=2012-10-14 }}, A Writenet Report by Professor Colin P.

In his essay ''[[Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation]]'' published by the [[Library of Tibetan Works and Archives]] at Dharamsala, [[Sergius L.

He concluded that, according to International Law, actions of Maoists in Tibet can be qualified as genocide, regardless of which of the above estimates of population losses one considers to be credible.

====Allegations of forced abortions, sterilisations and infanticide====
In ''The Making of Modern Tibet'', historian [[A. Tom Grunfeld]] observes that "in the years following the [1960] publication of the LIC's report, the [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]], [[Purshottam Trikamdas]] and the ICJ" ([[International Commission of Jurists]]) "all claimed to have found proof of sterilization; yet they failed to produce a single person who could be clinically examined to verify these claims."<ref>A. Tom Grunfeld, ''The Making of Modern Tibet'', 2nd edition, M.E. Sharpe, 1996, 352 p., p. 149.</ref>

A demographical survey of Pala – an area located in Western [[Changtang]] about 300 miles north-west of Lhasa – conducted by tibetologist [[Melvyn Goldstein]] brings to light that from 1959 to 1990 large families remained the norm and that no reproductive restraints were imposed on nomadic herders: "Despite repeated claims in the West that the Chinese had imposed a strict policy of birth control in Tibet, where ‘forced abortions, sterilisations and infanticides are everyday occurrences’ ([[New York Times]], 31 January 1992), there was no policy of restricting reproduction in Pala, let alone evidence of forced abortions, sterilisations or infanticide." An analysis of the fertility histories collected from 71 females aged from 15 to 59 provides strong evidence in support of the conclusion that no population control policy restricting couples to 2 or even 3 births was or is operative. Besides, no Pala nomads have ever been fined for any subsequent children, and all such children and their families enjoy full rights in the community<ref>Melvyn C.

In a study of fertility and family planning in rural Tibet published in 2002, [[Melvyn C. Goldstein]], Ben Jiao, [[Cynthia Beall|Cynthia M. Beall]] and Phuntsog Tsering claim that there was no evidence in any of the sites surveyed that Lhasa was applying a two-child birth rule in rural Tibet. Although a Tibet Information Network report stated this policy was in place, when [[Ngamring]] county, which was cited in the report, was visited, no such policy was evident. The Ngamring county government had striven to increase the use of family planning in the 1990s, but in the summer of 2000 no local nomads or officials in the area of study had heard anything about a two-child limit, nor had any of the officials interviewed at the Ngamring country seat. And finally, no fines had been imposed for fourth and subsequent births. For its authors, "the study highlights the dangers of using refugee reports and anecdotal evidence to interpret highly politicized situations."<ref>M.C. Goldstein, Ben Jiao, C.M.

In China's Birth Control Policy in the Tibet Autonomous Region - Myths and Realities, Melvyn C. Goldstein and Cynthia M.

In 1992, Paul Ingram, speaking on behalf of an [[NGO]] group for the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] claimed that "Few people or organisations seem willing to admit that the Chinese FORCE [sic] Tibetan women to be sterilised, or to have abortions, or will entertain the perspective that their policy is one of planned [[cultural genocide]] against the Tibetan people, supplemented by an [[Sinicization of Tibet|enormous influx of Chinese settlers]]. Yet there is a great deal of evidence and detailed testimony, which indicates that this has been Chinese policy in Tibet for many years," saying that it was "Nazi-like".<ref>NGO Group for the Convention on the Rights of the Child Database of NGO Reports presented to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child - Genocide in Tibet - Children of Despair - Introduction by Paul Ingram http://www.crin.org/docs/resources/treaties/crc.12/China_CFT2_NGO_Report.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081639/http://www.crin.org/docs/resources/treaties/crc.12/China_CFT2_NGO_Report.pdf |date=2012-01-19 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119081639/http://www.crin.org/docs/resources/treaties/crc.12/China_CFT2_NGO_Report.pdf |date=2012-01-19 }}</ref>

====Infringements on freedom of religion====

Tibetans in Tibet state that there are clear limits on their right to practice Buddhism. The most stringently enforced are the ban on public prayers for the [[14th Dalai Lama]]. Also, permission from authorities is required for any large public gathering, Buddhist gatherings not exempted.<ref>Asia Watch report, p. 17</ref>

The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, [[Yang Jiechi]], told a press conference in March 2009 that the Dalai Lama is "by no means a religious figure but a political figure."<ref name="CECC31">CECC Tibet paper, p. 31</ref> ''[[Xinhua]]'', quoting a [[Tibetologist]], echoed this theme, referring to the Dalai Lama's efforts in establishing a [[government in exile]], establishing a Constitution, and other things.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/04/content_8096455.htm|title=Tibetologist: 14th Dalai Lama political figure bent on "Tibet independence"|date=2008-05-04|access-date=2010-08-23|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127211130/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/04/content_8096455.htm|archive-date=2010-01-27|url-status=live}}</ref> Ending the "Dalai clique"'s use of [[monasteries]] for subversion against the state is a core part of the campaign that promotes the CCP's “stability and harmony in the religious field”.<ref name="CECC31"/> The state supervisory organ for Buddhism, the [[Buddhist Association of China]], changed their charter in 2009 to denounce the Dalai Lama for agitating for Tibetan independence.<ref name=CECC32>CECC Tibet paper, p. 32</ref> The [[Central People's Government]] has asserted a right to approve the next Dalai Lama, according to "historical conventions" used in the [[Qing Dynasty]] since 1793.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/12/content_11000802.htm|title=Tibetan official: Dalai Lama's reincarnation needs nod from central gov't|date=2009-03-12|access-date=2010-08-24|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|location=[[Beijing]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126150209/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/12/content_11000802.htm|archive-date=2010-11-26|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy]] (TCHRD) reported instances of "patriotic education" in 2005, from the testimony of "young Tibetan monks who escaped from Tibet". In them, monks were given political literature and a script to recite to County Religious Bureau officials when they were due to visit. They were instructed to practice denouncing the Dalai Lama as a "[[separatist]]" and to pledge allegiance to China, and were quizzed on the literature.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tchrd.org/publications/hr_updates/2005/hr200509.html#campaign|title=China recommences "patriotic education" campaign in Tibet's monastic institutions|work=Human Rights Update and Archives|publisher=[[Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy]]|date=September 2005|access-date=2010-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227112006/http://www.tchrd.org/publications/hr_updates/2005/hr200509.html#campaign|archive-date=2012-02-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> Officials also extolled the monks to accept the legitimacy of [[Gyaincain Norbu]], the government choice for [[11th Panchen Lama]].<ref name=CECC33-34>CECC Tibet paper, p. 33-34</ref>

According to the [[Congressional-Executive Commission on China|CECC]], educational, legal, and propaganda channels are used to pressure [[Tibetan Buddhists]] to change their religious beliefs into a doctrine that promotes government positions and policy. This has resulted instead in continuing Tibetan demands for freedom of religion and the Dalai Lama’s return to Tibet.<ref>CECC Tibet paper, p. 30.</ref> In June 2009, a monastic official who also holds the vice chairmanship of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference|CPPCC]] for Tibet, told monks at [[Galden Jampaling Monastery]] in [[Qamdo Prefecture|Qamdo]] that their freedom of religion was a result of the Party's benevolence.<ref name=CECC33-34/> The TCHRD has claimed that Chinese authorities in 2003 threatened residents of a Tibetan-inhabited county with [[Confiscation|expropriation]] if they did not hand over portraits of the Dalai Lama within a month.<ref name="ReferenceB">Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, "Anti-Dalai Lama Campaign intensifies in Kardze and Lithang County", 14 November 2003</ref>

The CCP further increased its influence over the teaching and practice of Tibetan Buddhism in 2009, including intensifying a media campaign to discredit the Dalai Lama as a religious leader and preventing Tibetans from respecting him as such. Chinese official statements also indicated that the government would select a successor to the [[Dalai Lama]], currently aged 74, when he passes away. Tibetans are expected to "embrace such a development."<ref name=cecctibet>Congressional-Executive Committee on China, [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/tibet/tibet_2008-2009.pdf Tibet Special Report 2008-2009] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106015954/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/tibet/tibet_2008-2009.pdf |date=2010-01-06 }} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106015954/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/virtualAcad/tibet/tibet_2008-2009.pdf |date=2010-01-06 }}, October 22, 2009</ref>

===='Reshaping' Tibetan Buddhism====
In February 2009 The “Tibet Branch” of the Buddhist Association of China changed their charter to pressure Tibetan Buddhist monks and nuns to treat the Dalai Lama as a "de facto criminal" and threat to Tibetan Buddhism, according to a report in China’s state-controlled media. The revised charter urged monks and nuns to “see clearly that the 14th Dalai Lama is the ringleader of the separatist political association which seeks ‘Tibet independence,’ a loyal tool of anti-China Western forces, the very root that causes social unrest in Tibet and the biggest obstacle for Tibetan Buddhism to build up its order.”<ref name=CECC32 /> The CECC argues that incorporating language classifying the Dalai Lama as a “separatist” into the charter of a government-designated religious organization increases the risk of punishment for monks and nuns who maintain religious devotion to the Dalai Lama even if they do not engage in overt political activity.<ref name=CECC32/>

On March 10, 2010, the Dalai Lama stated that "the Chinese authorities are conducting various political campaigns, including patriotic re-education campaign, in many monasteries in Tibet. They are putting the monks and nuns in prison-like conditions, depriving them the opportunity to study and practice in peace. These conditions make the monasteries function more like museums and are intended to deliberately annihilate Buddhism."<ref name="13UNHRC"/>

The CCP continued to state that Chinese policies in Tibetan areas are a success, and in 2008 and 2009 took a stance of pressuring other governments to abandon support of the Dalai Lama and instead to support the Party line on Tibetan issues.<ref>Congressional-Executive Committee on China, Annual report, 2009</ref>

The [[Dalai Lama]]'s advocacy on behalf of the Tibetan people and culture is used in official propaganda to argue that he is not a legitimate religious leader, but a political actor.<ref name="CECC31" /> Ending the Dalai Lama’s role as supreme religious leader is a core part of the campaign that promotes the CCP's “stability” and “harmony” in the Tibetan areas of China.<ref name="CECC31"/> This was carried out by state-run media and senior government officials. Minister of Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi, for example, told a press conference in March 2009 that the Dalai Lama is “by no means a religious figure but a political figure.”<ref name="CECC31"/>

The official response to continued criticism of CCP policy from Tibetans includes "aggressive campaigns" of “patriotic education” (“love the country, love religion”) and legal education. Patriotic education sessions require monks and nuns to pass examinations on political texts, affirm that "Tibet is historically a part of China," accept the legitimacy of the Panchen Lama installed by the Chinese government, and denounce the Dalai Lama.<ref name="CECC33-34"/>

In June 2009, a monastic official who also holds the rank of Vice Chairman of the TAR Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) spoke to monks at Jampaling (Qiangbalin) Monastery in Changdu (Chamdo) prefecture, TAR, and emphasized the dependency of “freedom of religion” on Party control and patriotism toward China. “Without the Party’s regulations,” he told the monks, “there would be no freedom of religion for the masses. To love religion, you must first love your country.”<ref name=CECC33-34/>

According to the CECC, Chinese officials justify such campaigns as "legitimate and necessary" by seeking to characterize and conflate a range of Tibetan objections to state policy as threats to China’s unity and stability.<ref name=CECC33-34/> An example given to substantiate this is comments made by Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) Party Secretary Zhang Qingli and Vice Minister of Public Security [[Zhang Xinfeng]], speaking during a February 2009 teleconference on “the work of maintaining social stability.”<ref name=CECC33-34/> They called for “large numbers of party, government, military, and police personnel in Tibet to immediately go into action” and “resolutely smash the savage attacks by the Dalai clique and firmly win the current people’s war against separatism and for stability.” Principal speakers at the teleconference stressed the importance of "education campaigns" in achieving such objectives.<ref name=CECC33-34/>

A Tibetan activist group reported that Chinese authorities in Kardze County and Lithang County in Kardze Tibet Autonomous Prefecture ("TAP"), Sichuan Province, as part of the anti-Dalai Lama campaign, threatened the local populace with confiscation of their land if they do not hand over portraits of the Dalai Lama within a month.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Writing in 2005, jurist Barry Sautman asserts that the ban on the public display of photos of the 14th Dalai Lama began in 1996 in the TAR but is not enforced in the Tibetan areas of the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan.<ref>Barry Sautman, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/2272481/Tibet-Research China's strategic vulnerability to minority separatism in Tibet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305135929/https://www.scribd.com/doc/2272481/Tibet-Research |date=2016-03-05 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305135929/https://www.scribd.com/doc/2272481/Tibet-Research |date=2016-03-05 }}, in ''Asian Affairs: An American Review'', 32, 2 (Summer 2005), 87 (32): "the ban on public display of Dalai Lama photos in the TAR [...] began in 1996.

===Tibetan-Muslim sectarian violence===
The majority of [[Muslims in Tibet]] are Hui people. Tension between Tibetans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]]'s rule in Qinghai such as [[Ngolok rebellions (1917–49)]] and the [[Sino-Tibetan War]]. In the past riots have broken out between Muslims and Tibetans. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims.<ref name="Demick">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |title=Tibetan-Muslim tensions roil China |last=Demick |first=Barbara |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2010-06-28 |url-status=dead |date=23 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622013126/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jun/23/world/fg-muslims23 |archive-date=June 22, 2010 }}</ref> In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan speaking [[Kache]] minority of Muslims).<ref name="Mayaram 2009 75">{{cite book| first = Shail |last=Mayaram| title = The other global city| url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=tOZ1pBTJvp4C}}| access-date = 2010-07-30| year = 2009| publisher = Taylor Francis US| isbn = 978-0-415-99194-0| page = 75 }}</ref>

===Repercussions of 2008 unrest===
{{Main|2008 Tibetan unrest}}

In March 2008, what began as routine monastic commemorations of [[Tibetan Uprising Day]] descended into riots, beatings, and arson by Tibetans against [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Hui people|Hui]], and even other Tibetans, killing 18 civilians and 1 police officer.<ref name=usstate2009/> Casualties sustained during the subsequent police crackdown are unknown, according to the U.S. Department of State.<ref name=usstate2009/> Many members of the [[People's Armed Police]] (PAP) remained in communities across the [[Tibetan Plateau]] during the year, and the fallout from the protests continued to impact on human rights outcomes for Tibetan people.<ref name=usstate2009/>

According to numerous sources, the U.S. Department of State says, many detained after the riots were subject to extrajudicial punishments such as severe beatings and deprivation of food, water, and sleep for long periods.<ref name=usstate2009/> In some cases detainees sustained broken bones and other serious injuries at the hands of PAP and Public Security Bureau (PSB) officers. According to eyewitnesses, the bodies of persons killed during the unrest or subsequent interrogation were disposed of secretly rather than returned to their families.<ref name=usstate2009/> Many monasteries and nunneries remained under virtual lock-down, while the authorities renewed the “Patriotic Education” campaign, according to [[Amnesty International]], involving written denunciations against the Dalai Lama.<ref name=amnesty2009>Amnesty International, [http://thereport.amnesty.org/en/regions/asia-pacific/china International report 2009 on China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204221017/http://thereport.amnesty.org/en/regions/asia-pacific/china |date=2009-12-04 }} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204221017/http://thereport.amnesty.org/en/regions/asia-pacific/china |date=2009-12-04 }}, no publish date given.</ref>

Tibetan members of the CCP were also targeted, including being forced to remove their children from Tibet exile community schools where they obtain religious education.<ref name=amnesty2009/> In March 2010 as many as 50 Tibetans were arrested for sending reports, photos, and video abroad during the unrest, according to [[Reporters Without Borders]] (RSF). One individual received a 10-year prison sentence.<ref>Cole, Michael J., "Fifty Tibetans allegedly caught over info leaks," Taipei Times, Wednesday, March 24, 2010.</ref>

It was Chinese government and Communist Party interference with the norms of Tibetan Buddhism, and "unremitting antagonism toward the Dalai Lama," that were key factors behind the protests, according to a special report by the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China.<ref name=cecctibet/>

Many members of the [[People's Armed Police]] (PAP) remained in communities across the [[Tibetan Plateau]] during the year, and the fallout from the protests continued to impact on human rights outcomes for Tibetan people.<ref name=usstate2009/> [[Amnesty International]] was "deeply concerned at the human rights violations" that occurred during these events and called on the [[Human Rights Council]] to address the human rights situation during the 2008 unrest.<ref>Our statement to UN Human Rights Council regarding Tibet https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/11342/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817000709/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/11342/ |date=2016-08-17 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817000709/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/11342/ |date=2016-08-17 }}</ref>

===Verifiability of exile pronouncements===
{{Disputed section|date=February 2011}}
Psychologist and writer [[Colin Goldner]]<ref>Colin Goldner is director of the Forum of Critical Psychology in Munich and author of ''Dalai Lama: Fall eines Gottkönigs'' (''Dalai Lama: The Fall of the God King''), Alibri Verlag, 2005, 733 p.</ref> alleges that although human rights abuses carried out by the [[People's Liberation Army]], especially during the [[Cultural Revolution]], cannot be justified, the pronouncements of Tibetan exiles cannot be trusted, because "These are, if not totally invented out of thin air, as a rule hopelessly exaggerated and/or refer to no longer actual happenings. The contention of the [[Central Tibetan Administration|Dalai Lama's exiled government]] that 'the daily life of the Tibetans in their own land' are dictated by 'torture, mental terror, discrimination and a total disrespect for of human dignity' is pure propaganda meant to collect sympathy points or monetary contributions; such accusations do not reflect today's realities in Tibet. Likewise, the accusations of forced abortions and blanket area sterilizations of Tibetan women, of a flooding of the land by Chinese colonists, of systematic destruction of the Tibetan cultural heritage do not agree with the facts."<ref>Colin Goldner, [http://www.eunacom.net/DalaiLama_E.htm The Myth of Tibet. How a dictatorial regime of monks is romantically transfigured] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723121037/http://www.eunacom.net/DalaiLama_E.htm |date=2011-07-23 }} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723121037/http://www.eunacom.net/DalaiLama_E.htm |date=2011-07-23 }}, translation into English of a German article published in the EUNACOM website under the title ''Mythos Tibet'' [# 49/1999, pp. 14-15].</ref>

[[Amnesty International]] have stated that there have been "consistent reports", including "testimonies by former detainees and relatives of detainees who left Tibet illegally" that indicated that people held in police stations and detainees in prisons and detention centres in Tibet have been "systematically tortured and ill-treated."<ref name=aiamnesty /> The chairman of the [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] stated that "allegations of torture were numerous and mutually corroborative: torture did not seem like an isolated phenomenon." China's report on its implementation of the Convention Against Torture did not address these allegations that torture had occurred in Tibet, with many of the questions the members of the Committee Against Torture had relating to this towards China "remained largely unanswered".<ref name=aiamnesty />

American sinologist [[Allen Carlson]] is of the opinion that it is nearly impossible, without substantial field research in Tibet, to verify the numerous allegations of violations advanced by China critics. He does, however, state, "my analysis of Beijing’s policies and practices has left me with the impression that the Chinese leadership has no reservations about using whatever means necessary to secure Chinese rule over Tibet."<ref>Allen Carlson, ''[http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/PS004.pdf Beijing's Tibet Policy: Securing Sovereignty and Legitimacy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927102148/http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/PS004.pdf|date=2011-09-27}} {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927102148/http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/PS004.pdf|date=2011-09-27}}'', Policy Studies 4, East-West Center, Washington, 71 p., p. 25 : "Without substantial field research in Tibet, it is nearly impossible to verify the numerous allegations of violations advanced by China critics."</ref>
