{{World trade}}

''' International trade''' is the exchange of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], [[goods]], and [[Service (economics)|services]] across [[international borders]] or territories<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/trade|title=Trade â€“ Define Trade at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}</ref> because there is a need or want of goods or services.<ref>[https://www.edumaritime.net/icc-academy International Trade and Finance by ICC Academy]</ref>

In most countries, such [[trade]] represents a significant share of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). While international trade has existed throughout history (for example [[Uttarapatha]], [[Silk Road]], [[Amber Road]], [[scramble for Africa]], [[Atlantic slave trade]], [[salt road]]s), its economic, social, and political importance has been on the rise in recent centuries.

Carrying out trade at an international level is a complex process when compared to [[domestic trade]]. When trade takes place between two or more nations factors like currency, government policies, economy, judicial system, laws, and markets influence trade.

To smoothen and justify the process of trade between countries of different economic standing, some international economic organisations were formed, such as the [[World Trade Organization]]. These organisations work towards the facilitation and growth of international trade. Statistical services of intergovernmental and supranational organisations and national statistical agencies publish [[official statistics]] on international trade.

== Characteristics of global trade ==
A [[Product (business) | product]] that is transferred or sold from a party in one country to a party in another country is an [[export]] from the originating country, and an [[import]] to the country receiving that product.  Imports and exports are accounted for in a country's current account in the [[balance of payments]].<ref>

Trading globally may give [[consumer]]s and countries the opportunity to be exposed to new [[Market (economics) | market]]s and products. Almost every kind of product can be found in the [[international market]], for example: food, clothes, spare parts, oil, jewellery, wine, stocks, currencies, and water. Services are also traded, such as in [[tourism]], [[banking]], [[consulting]], and [[transport]]ation.

Advanced [[technology]] (including [[transportation]]),  [[globalisation]],  [[industrialisation]],  [[outsourcing]] and [[multinational corporation]]s have major impacts on the international trade [[system]].{{cn|date=January 2020}}

Increasing international trade is crucial to the continuance of globalisation.{{cn|date=January 2020}} Countries would be [[autarky | limited to the goods and services produced within their own borders]] without international trade. International trade benefits many countries in various aspects. In the case of Vizio's flat-panel TVs, the manufacturing leadership has been shifting from one country to another due to global economic growth. At first, Japan could assemble the components of this TV and sell it out to the other countries such as US. However, recession affected Japan and South Korea took the lead in assembling the parts of this TV. Samsung played a critical role in the selling and manufacturing of the flat TV. Taiwan also took advantage of the recession that affected South Korea, and the investors assembled electronic components of Vizio's flat-panel TVs. At first, the US suffered from this cycle because despite inventing this business idea, other countries implemented it in the international market. Chinese eventually started manufacturing flat TVs at a lower cost compared to the previous investors. It is important to note that US benefited from the cycle because many investors could manufacture the TV at lower cost (Kandel, Kosenko, Morck & Yafeh, 2013). China is also another country that benefited from this business because it started manufacturing the product late at a lower price. South Korea and Japan suffered from the global recession because it was expensive to manufacture Vizio's flat-panel TVs at the beginning. 

Despite the benefits that many countries enjoyed from selling Vizio's flat-panel TVs, many nations suffered due to changes in international economy. Some countries experienced recessions that could not favor the manufacture of this product. For example, Japan became the first country to sell the flat-panel screens in 1990s, but decade-long recession affected the business operations and surrendered to South Korea. It is also important to note that South Korea suffered the same fate from the Asian crisis in 1997 (Lazarev, 2007). Mexico is one lucky country that never suffered the consequences of crisis. The country could assemble flat-panel TVs after sourcing the electronic parts from other countries (Hill & Hult, 2019). In this regard, it is clear that countries that took part in the manufacture of these TVs were affected in different ways. 

The US played a critical role in the invention and manufacture of the flat-panel TVs. In this regard, the decision made by the US may affect the entrepreneurs at the local and international level. If the US government demands that flat-panel displays be sold in the country only, the investors will have to sell the products at lower prices. It is clear that the prices of these flat-panel displays are cheap in the US compared to the countries. In addition, the local investors will not have the opportunity to compete at international level (Kandel, Kosenko, Morck & Yafeh, 2013). The quality of the screens can be compromised because the local manufacturers do not encounter foreign competitors. 

The future production of these TVs will change. Technology is changing the mode of production from one year to another. For instance, the manufacture of these TVs began from assembling electronic parts from different countries. However, things have changed and currently, every country is aiming at using the local resources to manufacture the screens.

== Differences from domestic trade ==
[[File:Downtown Manhattan From Aeroplane.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Port]]s play an important role in facilitating international trade. The [[Port of New York and New Jersey]] grew from the original [[New York Harbor|harbor]] at the convergence of the [[North River (Hudson River)|Hudson River]] and the [[East River]] at the [[Upper New York Bay]].]]
International trade is, in principle, not different from [[domestic trade]] as the motivation and the behavior of parties involved in a trade do not change fundamentally regardless of whether trade is across a border or not.

However, in practical terms, carrying out trade at an international level is typically a more complex process than domestic trade. The main difference is that international trade is typically more costly than domestic trade. This is due to the fact that a border typically imposes additional costs such as [[tariff]]s, time costs due to border delays, and costs associated with country differences such as language, the legal system, or culture ([[non-tariff barriers]]).

Another difference between domestic and international trade is that [[factors of production]] such as capital and [[Labour economics|labor]] are often more mobile within a country than across countries. Thus, international trade is mostly restricted to trade in goods and services, and only to a lesser extent to trade in capital, labour, or other factors of production. Trade in goods and services can serve as a substitute for trade in factors of production. Instead of importing a factor of production, a country can import goods that make intensive use of that factor of production and thus embody it. An example of this is the import of labor-intensive goods by the United States from China. Instead of importing Chinese labor, the United States imports goods that were produced with Chinese labor. One report in 2010, suggested that international trade was increased when a country hosted a network of immigrants, but the trade effect was weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into their new country.<ref name="twsA36">{{cite news

==International trade versus local production==
===Local food===
In the case of food production trade-offs in forms of [[local food]] and distant food production are controversial with limited studies comparing environmental impact and scientists cautioning that regionally specific environmental impacts should be considered.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rothwell |first1=Alison |last2=Ridoutt |first2=Brad |last3=Page |first3=Girija |last4=Bellotti |first4=William |title=Environmental performance of local food: trade-offs and implications for climate resilience in a developed city |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production |date=15 February 2016 |volume=114 |pages=420â€“430 |doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.04.096 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652615004710 |access-date=4 December 2020 |language=en |issn=0959-6526}}</ref> Effects of local food on greenhouse gas emissions may vary per origin and target region of the production. A 2020 study indicated that local food crop production alone cannot meet the demand for most food crops with "current production and consumption patterns" and the locations of food production ''at the time of the study'' for 72â€“89% of the global population and 100â€“km radiuses as of early 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dunphy |first1=SiobhÃ¡n |title=Majority of the world's population depends on imported food |url=https://www.europeanscientist.com/en/agriculture/majority-of-the-worlds-population-depends-on-imported-food/ |accessdate=17 May 2020 |work=European Scientist |date=28 April 2020}}</ref><ref name="phys-localfood">{{cite news |title=Relying on 'local food' is a distant dream for most of the world |url=https://phys.org/news/2020-04-local-food-distant-world.html |accessdate=17 May 2020 |work=phys.org |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kinnunen |first1=Pekka |last2=Guillaume |first2=Joseph H.

===Qualitative differences and economic aspects===
Qualitative differences between substitutive products of different production regions may exist due to different legal requirements and quality standards or different levels of controllability by local production- and [[governance]]-systems which may have aspects of [[security]] beyond resource security, [[environmental protection]], [[product quality]] and [[product design]] and [[health]]. The process of transforming supply as well as [[labor rights]] may differ as well.

Local production has been reported to increase local employment in many cases. A 2018 study claimed that international trade can increase local employment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Zhi |last2=Wei |first2=Shang-Jin |last3=Yu |first3=Xinding |last4=Zhu |first4=Kunfu |title=Re-examining the Effects of Trading with China on Local Labor Markets: A Supply Chain Perspective |date=13 August 2018 |url=https://www.nber.org/papers/w24886 |access-date=4 December 2020 |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |language=en}}</ref> A 2016 study found that local employment and total labor income in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing were negatively affected by rising exposure to imports.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Malgouyres |first1=ClÃ©ment |title=The Impact of Chinese Import Competition on the Local Structure of Employment and Wages: Evidence from France |journal=Journal of Regional Science |date=2017 |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=411â€“441 |doi=10.1111/jors.12303 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jors.12303 |access-date=4 December 2020 |language=en |issn=1467-9787}}</ref>

Local production in high-income countries, rather than distant regions may require higher wages for workers. Higher wages incentivize [[automation]]<ref>{{cite web |title=How Artificial Intelligence Could Widen the Gap Between Rich and Poor Nations |url=https://blogs.imf.org/2020/12/02/how-artificial-intelligence-could-widen-the-gap-between-rich-and-poor-nations/ |website=IMF Blog |access-date=4 December 2020|quote=Higher wages Advanced economies have higher wages because total factor productivity is higher. These higher wages induce firms in advanced economies to use robots more intensively to begin with, especially when robots easily substitute for workers. Then, when robot productivity rises, the advanced economy will benefit more in the long run. This divergence grows larger, the more robots substitute for workers.}}</ref> which could allow for automated workers' time to be reallocated by society and its economic mechanisms or be converted into leisure-like time.

====Specialization, production efficiency and regional differences====
Local production may require [[knowledge transfer]], [[technology transfer]] and may not be able to compete in efficiency initially with [[Division of labour|specialized]], established industries and businesses, or in consumer demand without policy measures such as [[eco-tariff]]s. Regional differences may cause specific regions to be more suitable for specific production, thereby increasing advantages of specific trade over specific local production. Forms of local production that are highly localized may not be able to meet the efficiency of more large-scale, highly consolidated production in terms of efficiency, including of environmental impact.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

===Resource security===
[[File:Water, energy and land insecurity in global supply chains.webm|thumb|A video explaining findings of the study "Water, energy and land insecurity in global supply chains"]]
A systematic, and possibly first large-scale, cross-sectoral analysis of [[water security|water]], [[energy security|energy]] and [[land degradation|land]] in[[security]] in 189 countries that links national and sector consumption to sources showed that countries and sectors are highly exposed to over-exploited, insecure, and degraded such resources with [[economic globalization]] having decreased security of [[Global supply chain management|global supply chains]]. The 2020 study finds that most countries exhibit greater exposure to resource [[Risk management|risks]] via international trade â€“ mainly from remote [[production (economics)|production]] sources â€“ and that diversifying trading partners is unlikely to help countries and sectors to reduce these or to improve their resource [[self-sufficiency]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Global trade linked to resource insecurity |url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/earth/sustainability/global-trade-linked-to-resource-insecurity/ |access-date=3 December 2020 |work=Cosmos Magazine |date=26 October 2020 |language=en-AU}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Dunphy |first1=SiobhÃ¡n |title=Is globalisation compatible with sustainable and resilient supply chains? |url=https://www.europeanscientist.com/en/agriculture/is-globalisation-compatible-with-sustainable-and-resilient-supply-chains/ |access-date=3 December 2020 |work=European Scientist |date=20 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Globalized economy making water, energy and land insecurity worse: study |url=https://phys.org/news/2020-10-globalized-economy-energy-insecurity-worse.html |website=phys.org |access-date=3 December 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Taherzadeh |first1=Oliver |last2=Bithell |first2=Mike |last3=Richards |first3=Keith |title=Water, energy and land insecurity in global supply chains |journal=Global Environmental Change |date=28 October 2020 |page=102158 |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2020.102158 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095937802030741X |access-date=3 December 2020 |language=en |issn=0959-3780}}</ref>

===Data===
====Official statistics====
Data on the value of exports and imports and their quantities often broken down by detailed lists of products are available in statistical collections on international trade published by the statistical services of intergovernmental and supranational organisations and national statistical institutes. The definitions and methodological concepts applied for the various statistical collections on international trade often differ in terms of definition (e.g. special trade vs. general trade) and coverage (reporting thresholds, inclusion of trade in services, estimates for smuggled goods and cross-border provision of illegal services). Metadata providing information on definitions and methods are often published along with the data.
