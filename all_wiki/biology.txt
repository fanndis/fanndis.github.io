==Etymology==
"Biology" derives from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] words of βίος; [[romanized]] bíos meaning "life" and -λογία; romanized logía (-logy) meaning "branch of study" or "to speak". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://topics.info.com/Who-coined-the-term-biology_716 |title=Who coined the term biology? |work=Info.com |access-date=2012-06-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509211839/http://topics.info.com/Who-coined-the-term-biology_716 |archive-date=2013-05-09 }}</ref><ref name=OnlineEtDict>{{cite web | title=biology | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=biology&allowed_in_frame=0 | publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307163258/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=biology&allowed_in_frame=0 | archive-date=2013-03-07 }}</ref>  Those combined make the Greek word βιολογία; romanized biología meaning biology. Despite this, the term βιολογία as a whole didn't exist in Ancient Greek. The first to borrow it was the English and French (''biologie''). Historically there was another term for "biology" in English, [[wikt:lifelore|'''lifelore''']]; it is rarely used today.

The Latin-language form of the term first appeared in 1736 when Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] (Carl von Linné) used ''biologi'' in his ''[[Bibliotheca Botanica]]''. It was used again in 1766 in a work entitled ''Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae: tomus III, continens geologian, biologian, phytologian generalis'', by [[Michael Christoph Hanow|Michael Christoph Hanov]], a disciple of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. The first German use, ''Biologie'', was in a 1771 translation of Linnaeus' work. In 1797, Theodor Georg August Roose used the term in the preface of a book, ''Grundzüge der Lehre van der Lebenskraft''. [[Karl Friedrich Burdach]] used the term in 1800 in a more restricted sense of the study of human beings from a morphological, physiological and psychological perspective (''Propädeutik zum Studien der gesammten Heilkunst''). The term came into its modern usage with the six-volume treatise ''Biologie, oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur'' (1802–22) by [[Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus]], who announced:<ref name=Richards>{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Robert J. |title=The Romantic Conception of Life: Science and Philosophy in the Age of Goethe|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn= 978-0-226-71210-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X7N4_i7vrTUC }}</ref>

:The objects of our research will be the different forms and manifestations of life, the conditions and laws under which these phenomena occur, and the causes through which they have been affected. The science that concerns itself with these objects we will indicate by the name biology [Biologie] or the doctrine of life [Lebenslehre].

==History==
{{Main|History of biology}}

Although modern biology is a relatively recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. [[Natural philosophy]] was studied as early as the ancient civilizations of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], and [[China]]. However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to [[ancient Greece]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Magner|first=Lois N.|title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC|year=2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-91100-6|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324125937/http://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC|archive-date=2015-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first=Anthony | last=Serafini |title=The Epic History of Biology |date=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3oECAAAQBAJ&q=biology%20egypt&pg=PA2|access-date=14 July 2015| isbn=978-1-4899-6327-7 }}</ref> While the formal study of [[medicine]] dates back to [[Pharaonic Egypt]], it was [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his ''[[History of Animals]]'' and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on [[botany]] that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name="eb1911">{{EB1911|wstitle=Theophrastus|inline=1}}</ref>

Scholars of the [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|medieval Islamic world]] who wrote on biology included [[al-Jahiz]] (781–869), [[Al-Dīnawarī]] (828–896), who wrote on botany,<ref name="Fahd-815">{{cite book | last=Fahd | first=Toufic |contribution=Botany and agriculture|page=815|editor-last1=Morelon |editor-first1=Régis |editor-last2=Rashed |editor-first2=Roshdi |year=1996 |title=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science |volume=3 |publisher=[[Routledge]] | isbn=978-0-415-12410-2| title-link=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science }}</ref> and [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi|Rhazes]] (865–925) who wrote on [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. [[Medicine]] was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought, especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life.

Biology began to quickly develop and grow with [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]]'s dramatic improvement of the [[microscope]]. It was then that scholars discovered [[spermatozoa]], [[bacteria]], [[infusoria]] and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by [[Jan Swammerdam]] led to new interest in [[entomology]] and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic [[dissection]] and [[staining]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Magner |first=Lois N. |title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-203-91100-6 |pages=133–44 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324125937/http://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC |archive-date=2015-03-24 }}</ref>

Advances in [[microscopy]] also had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the [[cell (biology)|cell]]. Then, in 1838, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann|Schwann]] began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of [[life]], although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of [[Robert Remak]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]], however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as [[cell theory]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Jan | last=Sapp | author-link=Jan Sapp | year=2003 | title=Genesis: The Evolution of Biology | chapter=7 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York. | isbn=978-0-19-515618-8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Coleman | first=William  | year=1977 | title=Biology in the Nineteenth Century: Problems of Form, Function, and Transformation | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York | isbn=978-0-521-29293-1 }}</ref>

Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. [[Carl Linnaeus]] published a basic [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.<ref>Mayr, Ernst. ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 4</ref> [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of [[common descent]]. Although he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the [[history of evolutionary thought]]; his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both [[Lamarck]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].<ref>Mayr, Ernst. ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 7</ref>

Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], who was the first to present a coherent theory of evolution.<ref name="Gould 2002 187">[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, Stephen Jay]]. ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory''. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press: Cambridge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-674-00613-5}}. p. 187.</ref> He posited that evolution was the result of environmental stress on properties of animals, meaning that the more frequently and rigorously an organ was used, the more complex and efficient it would become, thus adapting the animal to its environment. Lamarck believed that these acquired traits could then be passed on to the animal's offspring, who would further develop and perfect them.<ref name=Lam1914>[[#Lamarck1914|Lamarck (1914)]]</ref> However, it was the British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], combining the biogeographical approach of [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]], the uniformitarian geology of [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]], [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus's]] writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, who forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on [[natural selection]]; similar reasoning and evidence led [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] to independently reach the same conclusions.<ref>Mayr, Ernst. ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 10: "Darwin's evidence for evolution and common descent"; and chapter 11: "The causation of evolution: natural selection"</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Edward J. |title=Evolution: The Remarkable History of a Scientific Theory |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzLRvxlJhzkC |year=2006 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-58836-538-5 |chapter=Ch. 3 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324124009/http://books.google.com/books?id=xzLRvxlJhzkC |archive-date=2015-03-24 }}</ref> Although it was the subject of [[Creation–evolution controversy|controversy]] (which continues to this day), Darwin's theory quickly spread through the scientific community and soon became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biology.

The discovery of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and [[population genetics]]. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to [[DNA]] as the component of [[chromosomes]] that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as [[genes]]. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as [[viruses]] and [[bacteria]], along with the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of [[molecular genetics]]. From the 1950s to the present times, biology has been vastly extended in the [[Molecular Biology|molecular]] domain. The [[genetic code]] was cracked by [[Har Gobind Khorana]], [[Robert W. Holley]] and [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg]] after DNA was understood to contain [[codons]]. Finally, the [[Human Genome Project]] was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human [[genome]]. This project was essentially completed in 2003,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2940601.stm | title=Human genome finally complete | access-date=2006-07-22 | date=2003-04-14 | work=BBC News | first=Ivan | last=Noble | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614141605/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2940601.stm | archive-date=2006-06-14 }}</ref> with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was the first step in a globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.

==Foundations of modern biology==

===Cell theory===

{{Main|Cell theory}}

Cell theory states that the [[cell (biology)|cell]] is the fundamental unit of [[life]], that all living things are composed of one or more cells, and that all cells arise from pre-existing cells through [[cell division]]. In [[multicellular organisms]], every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a [[zygote|single cell]] in a fertilized [[egg (biology)|egg]]. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Mazzarello, P | title=A unifying concept: the history of cell theory | journal=Nature Cell Biology | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=E13–15 | date=May 1999 | pmid=10559875 | doi=10.1038/8964| s2cid=7338204 }}</ref> In addition, the phenomenon of [[energy transfer|energy flow]] occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as [[metabolism]]. Finally, cells contain hereditary information ([[DNA]]), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, [[abiogenesis]], amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.

===Evolution===
[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|alt=diagram showing Natural selection favoring predominance of surviving mutation|[[Natural selection]] of a population for dark coloration.]]
{{Main|Evolution}}
A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, and that all life-forms known have a [[Common descent|common origin]]. The theory of evolution postulates that all [[organism]]s on the [[Earth]], both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral [[gene pool]]. This [[last universal common ancestor of all organisms|universal common ancestor of all organisms]] is believed to have appeared about [[Timeline of evolution|3.5 billion years ago]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Life Evolving: Molecules, Mind, and Meaning | url=https://archive.org/details/lifeevolvingmole00duve_331 | url-access=limited | last=De Duve | first=Christian | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2002| page=[https://archive.org/details/lifeevolvingmole00duve_331/page/n60 44] | isbn=978-0-19-515605-8}}</ref> Biologists regard the ubiquity of the [[genetic code]] as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eukaryote]]s (see: [[origin of life]]).<ref name="Futuyma">{{cite book |author=Futuyma, DJ |title=Evolution |year=2005 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-0-87893-187-3 |oclc=57311264 |url=https://archive.org/details/evolution0000futu }}</ref>

Darwin theorized that species flourish or die when subjected to the processes of [[natural selection]] or [[selective breeding]].<ref>[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1859).

The evolutionary history of the [[species]]—which describes the characteristics of the various species from which it descended—together with its genealogical relationship to every other species is known as its [[phylogeny]]. Widely varied approaches to biology generate information about phylogeny. These include the comparisons of [[DNA sequence]]s, a product of [[molecular biology]] (more particularly [[genomics]]), and comparisons of [[fossil]]s or other records of ancient organisms, a product of [[paleontology]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/q-more/biology-definition/phylogeny/ |title=Phylogeny |publisher=Bio-medicine.org |date=2007-11-11 |access-date=2013-10-02 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224700/http://www.bio-medicine.org/q-more/biology-definition/phylogeny/ |archive-date=2013-10-04 }}</ref> Biologists organize and analyze evolutionary relationships through various methods, including [[phylogenetics]], [[phenetics]], and [[cladistics]]. (For a summary of major events in the evolution of life as currently understood by biologists, see [[evolutionary timeline]].)

Evolution is relevant to the understanding of the natural history of life forms and to the understanding of the organization of current life forms. But, those organizations can only be understood in light of how they came to be by way of the process of evolution. Consequently, evolution is central to all fields of biology.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Montévil, M |author2=Mossio, M |author3=Pocheville, A |author4=Longo, G  | title=Theoretical principles for biology: Variation | journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology | volume=122 | issue=1 | pages=36–50 | date=October 2016 | pmid=27530930 | doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.005 | url=https://www.academia.edu/27942089 | series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320150224/http://www.academia.edu/27942089/Theoretical_principles_for_biology_Variation | archive-date=2018-03-20 }}</ref>

{{Main|Genetics}}
[[Gene]]s are the primary units of inheritance in all organisms. A gene is a unit of [[heredity]] and corresponds to a region of [[DNA]] that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into [[protein]]s. Cells [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribe]] a DNA gene into an [[RNA]] version of the gene, and a [[ribosome]] then [[Translation (biology)|translates]] the RNA into a sequence of [[amino acid]]s known as a protein. The [[genetic code|translation code]] from RNA codon to amino acid is the same for most organisms. For example, a sequence of DNA that codes for [[insulin]] in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms, such as plants.<ref>Marcial, Gene G.

DNA is found as linear [[chromosome]]s in [[eukaryote]]s, and circular chromosomes in [[prokaryote]]s. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of [[DNA]] and [[histone]]s. The set of chromosomes in a cell and any other hereditary information found in the [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], or other locations is collectively known as a cell's [[genome]]. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the [[cell nucleus]], or with small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the [[nucleoid]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Thanbichler, M |author2=Wang, SC |author3=Shapiro, L  | title=The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal=Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume=96 | issue=3 | pages=506–21 | date=October 2005 | pmid=15988757 | doi=10.1002/jcb.20519 |s2cid=25355087 }}</ref> The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its [[genotype]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8472 |title=Genotype definition – Medical Dictionary definitions |publisher=Medterms.com |date=2012-03-19 |access-date=2013-10-02 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054803/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8472 |archive-date=2013-09-21 }}</ref>

Homeostasis is the ability of an [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] to regulate its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple [[dynamic equilibrium]] adjustments that are controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms. All living [[organism]]s, whether [[Single celled|unicellular]] or [[multicellular]], exhibit homeostasis.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Rodolfo | first=Kelvin | date=January 2000 | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-homeostasis/ | title=What is homeostasis? | journal=Scientific American | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020456/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-homeostasis | archive-date=2013-12-03 }}</ref>

To maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain functions, a system must detect and respond to perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through [[negative feedback]] that stabilize conditions by reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of [[glucagon]] when sugar levels are too low.

===Energy===
The survival of a living organism depends on the continuous input of [[energy]]. Chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned to extract [[Chemistry#Energy|energy]] from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, [[molecule]]s of [[chemical substance]]s that constitute [[food]] play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed and reused in that organism's biological, [[chemical reaction]]s; second, food can be transformed into new molecular structures (biomolecules) that are of use to that organism.

The organisms responsible for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or [[autotroph]]s. Nearly all such organisms originally draw their energy from the sun.<ref name=bryantfrigaard>{{cite journal |author1=Bryant, DA |author2=Frigaard, NU  | title=Prokaryotic photosynthesis and phototrophy illuminated | journal=Trends in Microbiology | volume=14 | issue=11 | pages=488–96 | date=November 2006 | pmid=16997562 | doi=10.1016/j.tim.2006.09.001 }}</ref> Plants and other [[phototroph]]s use solar energy via a process known as [[photosynthesis]] to convert raw materials into organic molecules, such as [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], whose bonds can be broken to release energy.<ref>{{cite book | author=Smith, AL |title=Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1997 |page=508 | isbn=978-0-19-854768-6 | quote=Photosynthesis – the synthesis by organisms of organic chemical compounds, esp. carbohydrates, from carbon dioxide using energy obtained from light rather than the oxidation of chemical compounds.}}</ref> A few [[ecosystems]], however, depend entirely on energy extracted by [[chemotroph]]s from [[methane]], [[sulfides]], or other non-[[Solar energy|luminal]] energy sources.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Edwards | first=Katrina | title=Microbiology of a Sediment Pond and the Underlying Young, Cold, Hydrologically Active Ridge Flank | journal=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution }}</ref>

Some of the energy thus captured produces [[biomass]] and energy that is available for growth and development of other [[life]] forms. The majority of the rest of this biomass and energy are lost as waste molecules and heat.

===Physiological===
{{Main|Physiology}}

Physiology is the study of the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms function as a whole. The theme of "structure to function" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into [[plant physiology]] and [[animal physiology]], but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular [[organism]] is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of [[yeast]] cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of [[human physiology]] to non-human species. Plant physiology borrows techniques from both research fields.

Physiology is the study the interaction of how, for example, the [[nervous system|nervous]], [[immune system|immune]], [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[respiratory system|respiratory]], and [[circulatory system|circulatory]] systems, function and interact. The study of these systems is shared with such [[medicine|medically]] oriented disciplines as [[neurology]] and [[immunology]].

===Evolutionary===
[[Current research in evolutionary biology|Evolutionary research]] is concerned with the origin and descent of [[species]], and their change over time. It employs scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines; for example, those with special training in particular [[organism]]s such as [[mammalogy]], [[ornithology]], [[botany]], or [[herpetology]], but are of use in answering more general questions about evolution.

Evolutionary biology is partly based on [[paleontology]], which uses the [[fossil]] record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution,<ref name=Jablonski>{{cite journal | author=Jablonski D | title=The future of the fossil record | journal=Science | volume=284 | issue=5423 | pages=2114–16 | date=June 1999 | pmid=10381868 | doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2114 }}</ref> and partly on the developments in areas such as [[population genetics]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Gillespie | first=John H. | author-link=John H.

{{Main|Systematics}}

Multiple [[speciation]] events create a tree structured system of relationships between species. The role of [[systematics]] is to study these relationships and thus the differences and similarities between species and groups of species.<ref>{{cite book | last=Neill | first=Campbell | title=Biology; Fourth edition | publisher=The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-8053-1940-8 | page=G-21 (Glossary) }}</ref>
However, systematics was an active field of research long before evolutionary thinking was common.<ref>{{cite book | last=Douglas | first=Futuyma |author-link=Douglas Futuyma | title=Evolutionary Biology; Third edition | publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-87893-189-7 | page=88 }}</ref>

Traditionally, living things have been divided into five kingdoms: [[Monera]]; [[Protist]]a; [[Fungus|Fungi]]; [[Plant]]ae; [[Animal]]ia.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Margulis, Lynn |author2=Schwartz, KV  |author-link1= Lynn Margulis |title=Five Kingdoms: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth |url=https://archive.org/details/fivekingdomsillu00marg_0 |url-access=registration |edition=3rd |publisher= WH Freeman & Co|year=1997 |isbn=978-0-7167-3183-2 |oclc=223623098}}</ref> However, many scientists now consider this five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the [[three-domain system]]: [[Archaea]] (originally Archaebacteria); [[Bacteria]] (originally Eubacteria) and [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]] (including [[protist]]s, [[fungi]], [[plants]], and [[animal]]s).<ref name="domain">{{cite journal |author1=Woese, CR |author2=Kandler, O |author3=Wheelis, ML  | title=Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=87 | issue=12 | pages=4576–79 | date=June 1990 | pmid=2112744 | pmc=54159 | doi=10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W }}</ref> These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of key biomolecules such as [[ribosome]]s.<ref name="domain"/>

Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:
[[Domain (biology)|Domain]]; [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]]; [[Phylum]]; [[Class (biology)|Class]]; [[Order (biology)|Order]]; [[Family (biology)|Family]]; [[Genus]]; [[Species]].

Outside of these categories, there are obligate intracellular [[parasite]]s that are "on the edge of life"<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rybicki, EP | year=1990 | title=The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics | journal=S Afr J Sci | volume=86 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603479 | pages=182–86 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718162450/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603479_The_classification_of_organisms_at_the_edge_of_life_or_problems_with_virus_systematics | archive-date=2017-07-18 }}</ref> in terms of [[metabolism|metabolic]] activity, meaning that many scientists do not actually classify such structures as alive, due to their lack of at least one or more of the fundamental functions or characteristics that define life. They are classified as [[virus (biology)|viruses]], [[viroid]]s, [[prion]]s, or [[Satellite (biology)|satellites]].

The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''Homo'' is the genus, and ''sapiens'' the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase.<ref>{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J|author2=Barrie, FR|author3=Buck, WR|author4=Demoulin, V|author5=Greuter, W|author6=Hawksworth, DL|author7=Herendeen, PS|author8=Knapp, S|author9=Marhold, K|author10=Prado, J|author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, WF|author12=Smith, GF|author13=Wiersema, JH|author14=Turland, NJ |display-authors=6 |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

The dominant classification system is called the [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. How organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN), the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN), and the [[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]] (ICNB). The classification of [[viruses]], [[viroids]], [[prions]], and all other sub-viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) and is known as the International Code of Viral Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp |title=ICTV Virus Taxonomy 2009 |publisher=Ictvonline.org |access-date=2013-10-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225742/http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp |archive-date=2013-10-04 }}</ref><ref name=ictvdbpopsi><!--citation specified in source-->''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090813214826/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/Ictv/fs_pospi.htm Index of Viruses – Pospiviroidae]'' (2006).

[[Ecology]] is the study of the distribution and abundance of [[life|living organisms]], the interaction between them and their [[natural environment|environment]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Begon, M |author2=Townsend, CR |author3=Harper, JL  | title=Ecology: From individuals to ecosystems |edition=4th |year=2006 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-1117-1 }}</ref> An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and [[biotic factors]] as well as local [[abiotic factors]] (non-living) such as [[climate]] and [[ecology]].<ref name="habitats_of_the_world">{{cite book | title=Habitats of the world | year=2004 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-_mlcy8rGgC&pg=PA238 | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | location=New York | isbn=978-0-7614-7523-1 | page=238 }}</ref> One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic [[bacterium]] responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African [[savanna]]. For any species, [[behavior]]s can be [[co-operation|co-operative]], [[Competition (biology)|competitive]], [[parasite|parasitic]], or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]]. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an [[ecosystem]].

Ecological systems are studied at several different levels, from the scale of the ecology of individual organisms, to those of [[population]]s, to the [[ecosystem]]s and finally the [[biosphere]]. The term [[population biology]] is often used interchangeably with [[population ecology]], although ''population biology'' is more frequently used in the case of [[diseases]], [[viruses]], and [[microbes]], while the term population ecology is more commonly applied to the study of plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.

[[Ethology]] is the study of animal [[behavior]] (particularly that of social animals such as [[primate]]s and [[canidae|canids]]), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the [[evolution]] of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of [[natural selection]]. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was [[Charles Darwin]], whose book, ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]],'' influenced many ethologists to come.<ref name="black">{{cite journal | author=Black, J | title=Darwin in the world of emotions | journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume=95 | issue=6 | pages=311–13 | date=June 2002 | pmid=12042386 | pmc=1279921 | doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.6.311 }}</ref>

[[Biogeography]] studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the [[Earth]], focusing on such topics as [[plate tectonics]], [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]], [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] and [[Animal migration|migration]], and [[cladistics]].

==Basic unresolved problems in biology==
{{Main|List of unsolved problems in biology}}
Despite the profound advances made over recent decades in our understanding of life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. Some examples are

'''[[Abiogenesis|Origin of life]]'''. While there is very good evidence for the abiotic origin of biological compounds such as [[amino acids]], [[Nucleotide|nucleotides]] and [[Lipid|lipids]], it is largely unclear how these molecules came together to form the first [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Related is the question of [[Extraterrestrial life|extra-terrestrial life]]. If we understand how life originated on earth, we can predict more reliably which conditions are required to generate life on other planets. 

'''Aging'''. At present, there is no consensus view on the underlying cause of aging. Various competing theories are outlined in [[Ageing#Theories|Ageing Theories]].

'''Pattern formation'''. We have a good understanding of [[pattern formation]] in some systems, such as the early [[insect]] [[embryo]], but the generation of many patterns in nature cannot be explained easily, e.g. the stripes in [[Zebra|zebras]] or many [[Snake|snakes]], such as [[Coral snake|coral snakes]]. While we know that the patterns are generated by selective [[Regulation of gene expression|activation or repression of genes]], many of these genes and their regulatory mechanisms remain unknown.

==Branches and career options==
Biology is an area of science with numerous subdisciplines that are concerned with all aspects of life, in fact all aspects of modern human life. That said, there are countless career options, ranging from basic science to industrial or agricultural applications. These are the main branches of biology:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Branches_of_biology |title=Branches of Biology |publisher=Biology-online.org |access-date=2013-10-02 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727104032/http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Branches_of_biology |archive-date=2013-07-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art28786.asp |title=Biology on |publisher=Bellaonline.com |access-date=2013-10-02 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005010344/http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art28786.asp |archive-date=2013-10-05 }}</ref>{{efn|For a more detailed list, see ''[[Outline of biology]]''.}}
