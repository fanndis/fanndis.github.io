Although same-sex couples are currently unable to jointly adopt a child, they may adopt stepchildren.

The [[Executive Yuan]] first proposed the legal recognition of [[same-sex marriage]] in 2003; however, the bill received [[Anti-LGBT|strong opposition]] at that time and was not voted on. Discrimination on the basis of [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]] and gender characteristics in education has been banned nationwide since 2004.<ref>{{cite act |title=Gender Equity Education Act|type=Act|language=English|date=23 June 2004|url=https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=H0080067&DF=&SNo=13-14|article=13–14|access-date=9 April 2018}}</ref> With regard to employment, discrimination on the basis sexual orientation has also been prohibited by law since 2007.<ref>{{cite act |title=Employment Service Act|type=Act|language=English|date=23 May 2007|url=https://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=N0090001&DF=&SNo=5|article=5|access-date=9 April 2018}}</ref>

On 24 May 2017, the [[Judicial Yuan]] ruled that the existing marriage law was [[unconstitutional]], and that same-sex couples should gain the right to marry. The court gave the [[Legislative Yuan]] a maximum of two years to either amend existing laws or enact laws to provide legal recognition of same-sex marriage. According to the court ruling, if the Parliament failed to do so by 24 May 2019, same-sex marriage would automatically become legal.<ref name="Constitutional Court Ruling">{{cite act |title=Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 748|type=Constitutional Interpretation|language=English|date=24 May 2017|url=http://www.judicial.gov.tw/constitutionalcourt/EN/p03_01.asp?expno=748|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Wu|first=J.R.|date=24 May 2017|title=Taiwan court rules in favor of same-sex marriage, first in Asia|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-lgbt-marriage/taiwan-court-rules-in-favor-of-same-sex-marriage-first-in-asia-idUSKBN18K0UN|work=Reuters|location=Taipei|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref> On 17 May 2019, the Legislative Yuan approved a bill, submitted by the Executive Yuan, [[Legal status of same-sex marriage|recognizing]] marriage for same-sex couples.

Thus, Taiwan became the first country in Asia to [[Legal_status_of_same-sex_marriage#Taiwan|recognize]] same-sex marriage.<ref>{{cite news |title=Taiwan legalises same-sex marriage, a first in Asia |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-17/taiwan-legalises-same-sex-marriage/11124868 |accessdate=20 May 2019 |work=ABC News |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=17 May 2019 |language=en-AU}}</ref>

The first [[Taiwan Pride]] was held in [[Taipei]] in 2003. By 2015, when the event was attended by 80,000 participants, it had become the second-largest [[Gay pride|LGBT pride]] in Asia, behind [[Tel Aviv Pride]] in [[Israel]], which has led many to refer to Taiwan as one of the most [[Liberalism in Taiwan|liberal]] countries in Asia as well.<ref>{{cite news|last=McCormick|first=Joseph Patrick|date=31 October 2015|title=Asia's biggest Pride takes place as tens of thousands march in Taipei|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/10/31/asias-biggest-pride-takes-place-as-tens-of-thousands-march-in-taipei/|work=Pink News|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref> By 2019, attendance had grown to 170,000 participants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tw.news.yahoo.com/同婚元年台灣同志遊行登場-創意拼字盼珍惜民主-072140092.html|title=同婚元年！台灣同志遊行 17萬人上街挺多元創紀錄|work=Yahoo!|date=26 October 2019|language=zh}}</ref><ref name="nyt"/>

==Legality of same-sex sexual activity==
Private, consensual, and [[noncommercial]] sexual activity between adults of the same sex is legal in [[Taiwan]]. In fact, [[homosexuality]] has never been a crime. The [[age of consent]] is 16 for both homosexual and heterosexual acts.<ref>{{cite act |title=Criminal Code of the Republic of China (Taiwan)|type=Act|language=English|article=227|date=1 January 1935|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=C0000001&DF=&SNo=227|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref>

==Constitutional rights==
The [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] does not expressly mention [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]]; however, the [[Judicial Yuan|Constitutional Court]] ruling on [[same-sex marriage]] in 2017 (i.e. ''Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 748''), based on the following two articles of the Constitution, has confirmed the following constitutional protections for [[LGBT]] people:

Article 7 of the Constitution states that "all citizens of the Republic of China, irrespective of sex, religion, race, class, or party affiliation, shall be equal before the law".<ref>{{cite act |title=Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan)|type=Constitution|language=English|article=7|date=1 January 1947|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=A0000001&DF=&SNo=7|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref> In the [[Judicial interpretation|constitutional interpretation]] issued on 24 May 2017, the [[Judicial Yuan|Constitutional Court]] reasoned that the prohibited grounds of discrimination listed in the Article are "illustrative, rather than exhaustive", so the right to equal protection applies to other classifications "such as disability or sexual orientation".<ref name="Constitutional Court Ruling" />

Article 22 of the Constitution stipulates that "all other freedoms and rights of the people that are not detrimental to social order or public welfare shall be guaranteed under the Constitution".<ref>{{cite act |title=Constitution of the Republic of China (Taiwan)|type=Constitution|language=English|article=22|date=1 January 1947|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=A0000001&DF=&SNo=22|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref> The Grand Justices ruled on 24 May 2017 that the freedom of marriage guaranteed by the Article applies to persons of all sexual orientations.<ref name="Constitutional Court Ruling" />

According to Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 185, "the interpretations of the Judicial Yuan shall be binding upon every institution and person in the country".<ref>{{cite act |title=Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 185|type=Constitutional Interpretation|language=English|date=27 January 1984|url=http://www.judicial.gov.tw/constitutionalcourt/EN/p03_01.asp?expno=185|access-date=9 April 2018}}</ref>

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==

{{wikinews|Taiwan's Constitutional Court legalizes gay marriage, gives legislators two years to amend marriage laws}}
In October 2003, the [[Executive Yuan]] proposed legislation granting the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples, but it faced bipartisan opposition from members of both the Cabinet (formed by the ruling [[Democratic Progressive Party]], DPP) and the [[Legislative Yuan]] (controlled by the [[Kuomintang]]-led [[Pan-blue coalition]]) and stalled, and thus not voted on.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hogg|first=Chris|date=28 October 2003|title=Taiwan move to allow gay unions|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3219721.stm|work=BBC News|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=28 October 2003|title=Taiwan moves to recognise gay marriages|url=https://www.fridae.asia/gay-news/2003/10/28/580.taiwan-moves-to-recognise-gay-marriages|work=Fridae|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref>

In 2011, aiming to promote awareness about same-sex marriage, about 80 lesbian couples held Taiwan's then biggest same-sex wedding party, attracting about 1,000 friends, relatives and curious onlookers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wang|first=Amber|date=22 August 2011|title=Taiwan hosts its biggest same-sex 'wedding' party|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2011/08/22/2003511370|work=Taipei Times|location=Taipei|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref> In 2012, the first same-sex Buddhist wedding was held for Fish Huang and her partner You Ya-ting, with Buddhist master Shih Chao-hui presiding over the ritual.<ref>{{cite news|last=Yiu|first=Derek|date=11 August 2012|title=Lesbian couple in first Buddhist wedding|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/lesbian-couple-first-buddhist-wedding110812/|work=Gay Star News|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=11 August 2012|title=Taiwan couple in same-sex Buddhist wedding|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/61441/taiwan-couple-in-same-sex-buddhist-wedding/|work=inquirer.net|location=Taoyuan|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref> In 2013, Chen Ching-hsueh and Kao Chih-Wei, the second Taiwanese same-sex couple to wed publicly, dropped a prolonged fight to have their marriage legally recognized, citing intense social pressure.<ref>{{cite news|last=Yiu|first=Derek|date=23 March 2012|title=Taiwanese court to hear same-sex household registration case|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/taiwanese-court-hear-same-sex-household-registration-case230312/|work=Gay Star News|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Leach|first=Anna|date=24 January 2013|title=Taiwanese gay couple drop legal fight|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/taiwanese-gay-couple-drop-legal-fight240113/|work=Gay Star News|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref> Later that year, lifelong gay activist [[Chi Chia-wei]] picked up Chen and Kao's fight to have same-sex marriage recognized, presenting his case in the Taipei High Administrative Court for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|author=cms2cmsuser|date=9 October 2013|title=Veteran activist takes Taiwan to court over gay marriage|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/veteran-activist-takes-taiwan-to-court-over-gay-marriage/|work=Gay Star News|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>

On 22 December 2014, a proposed amendment to the [[Civil Code]] which would have legalized same-sex marriage was due to go under review by the Judiciary Committee of the [[Legislative Yuan]]. If the amendment had passed the committee stage, it would then have been voted on at the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan in 2015. The amendment included replacing the current articles regarding marriage in the [[Civil Code]] with gender-neutral terms, effectively recognizing same-sex marriage. It would have also allowed same-sex couples to adopt children. [[Yu Mei-nu]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) had expressed support for the amendment, together with more than 20 other DPP lawmakers as well as two from the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]] and one each from the ruling party [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Lii|first=Wen|date=21 December 2014|title=Gay marriage proposal set for review|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/12/21/2003607251|work=Taipei Times|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref> Taiwan would have become the first Asian state (and non-UN recognized entity) to legally recognize same-sex marriage if the [[Civil Code]] had been amended. However, the bill stalled, and the attempt officially failed in January 2016 as the [[Eighth Legislative Yuan]] ended.

In November 2015, around two months before the general election, presidential candidate [[Tsai Ing-wen]] announced her support for same-sex marriage.<ref>{{cite news|first=Darren|last=Wee|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/watch-taiwan-presidential-frontrunner-officially-endorses-marriage-equality/|title=Watch: Taiwan presidential frontrunner officially endorses marriage equality|date=2 November 2015|publisher=Gay Star News|accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref> In July 2016, several lawmakers of the [[Ninth Legislative Yuan]] announced that they would introduce a same-sex marriage bill in Parliament by the end of the year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gohl|first=Cody|url=http://www.newnownext.com/marriage-equality-could-be-coming-to-taiwan-as-early-as-next-year/07/2016/|title=Marriage Equality Could Be Coming To Taiwan As Early As Next Year|publisher=Logo|accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref> In October, two same-sex marriage bills were introduced to the [[Legislative Yuan]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Gerber|first=Abraham|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2016/10/25/2003657881|title=Push for same-sex marriages started by DPP and NPP|work=Taipei Times|date=25 October 2016|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>

=== Registration of same-sex couples ===
In May 2015, the [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] of [[Kaohsiung]] announced a plan to allow same-sex couples to apply for a remark of their partnership on the computerized household register, largely for reference only. It would be of little use when a person wishes to grant consent to surgery on the partner's behalf at hospitals, for instance. Taiwan LGBT Rights Advocacy, an NGO, criticized the plan as merely a measure to "make fun of" the community without having any substantive effect.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ta|first1=Ya-chen|last2=Wang|first2=Shu-fen|last3=Wu|first3=Lilian|date=19 May 2015|title=Gay rights group says Kaohsiung decision 'makes fun of' them|work=Central News Agency|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201505190031.aspx|accessdate=10 April 2017}}</ref>

In the current practice, any two unmarried persons of the same sex can apply, in person, to any household registration office (except in the four counties mentioned above) to have their partnership recorded on the computerized household register. However, this information will not be displayed on either the [[National Identification Card (Republic of China)|National Identification Card]] or the Household Certificate (the latter shows the basic personal information of all individuals registered under the same address and the relationship between these individuals). Instead, the household registration office issues a letter to the applicants certifying the registration. [[Kaohsiung City Government|Kaohsiung]] and [[Taipei City Government|Taipei]] municipalities also issue partnership cards.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=11 November 2016|title=Kaohsiung issues nation's first 'partnership card' to two women|work=Central News Agency|location=Kaohsiung|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/afav/201611110022.aspx|access-date=10 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Xie|first1=Peiqi (謝珮琪)|date=23 December 2016|script-title=zh:台北市26日起核發同性伴侶證，方便同性伴侶對外證明關係|language=zh|trans-title=Taipei City begins issuing partnership cards for same-sex couples to prove relationship from December 26|work=The Storm Media|url=http://www.storm.mg/article/204778|access-date=10 April 2018}}</ref> Citizens with a foreign partner are also eligible for registration, but the foreign partner needs to provide a Certificate of No Marriage Record, or equivalent, from the country of origin and have it authenticated by the respective [[List of diplomatic missions of Taiwan|embassy]] or [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office|representative office]] of Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web|author=<!--Not stated-->|date=20 July 2017|script-title=zh:臺北市政府民政局中文網站-同性伴侶註記作業|trans-title=Protocol of same-sex partnership registration|url=https://ca.gov.taipei/cp.aspx?n=CD3F9DC9F1D9576A|access-date=10 April 2018|website=Department of Civil Affairs, Taipei City Government|language=zh}}</ref>

Nevertheless, the same-sex partnership registration, being an administrative measure, does not confer any actual legal status to a same-sex couple. The protections offered to same-sex partners are very limited, such as the right of requesting family care leave, applying for public housing as a family unit (in Taipei only) and granting consent to surgery on the partner's behalf.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=5 March 2017|script-title=zh:最快5月　北市開放同性伴侶登記社會住宅|language=zh|trans-title=Same-sex couples can apply for social housing in Taipei City as soon as May|work=Up Media|url=http://www.upmedia.mg/news_info.php?SerialNo=13196|access-date=12 April 2018}}</ref>

===Constitutional Court ruling and referendum===
On 24 March 2017, the [[Judicial Yuan|Constitutional Court]] heard a case brought by gay rights activist [[Chi Chia-wei]] (whose attempt at registering a marriage with his partner in 2013 was rejected) and the [[Taipei City Government]]'s Department of Civil Affairs. Both petitioners had requested a constitutional interpretation on the issue. The Court decided to issue a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] on whether the current [[Civil Code]] in fact allows same-sex marriage and if not, whether it violates articles under the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] pertaining to equal rights and the freedom to marry. Those who appeared before the Court on that day included counsels of both petitioners, Justice Minister [[Chiu Tai-san]] (who defended the existing laws on marriage) and a panel of legal scholars. This was the first time a Constitutional Court hearing was broadcast live.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jirs.judicial.gov.tw/GNNWS/download.asp?sdMsgId=50775|title=Press Release|date=10 February 2017|website=Judicial Yuan, Republic of China (Taiwan)}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first1=Kuo-wen|last1=Yang|first2=William|last2=Hetherington|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/02/11/2003664765|title=Council of Grand Justices to broadcast live discussion on same-sex marriage|date=11 February 2017|work=Taipei Times|accessdate=10 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39376423|title=Taiwan top court hears landmark gay marriage case|date=24 March 2017|work=BBC News|accessdate=10 April 2017}}</ref>

The [[Judicial Yuan|Constitutional Court]] ruled on 24 May 2017 that the clauses pertaining to marriage in the [[Civil Code]] were unconstitutional. The panel of judges gave the Parliament ([[Legislative Yuan]]) two years to amend or enact new laws, which would make Taiwan the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. The Court further stipulated that should the [[Legislative Yuan]] fail to legalize same-sex marriage within two years, same-sex couples would be able to marry by going through the existing marriage registration procedure at any household registration office.<ref name="Constitutional Court Ruling" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/24/asia/taiwan-same-sex-marriage/index.html|title=Taiwan step closer to being first in Asia for same-sex marriage|first1=Katie|last1=Hunt|first2=Karina|last2=Tsui|work=CNN|date=24 May 2017|accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref>

Since 2010, there has also been a pride parade in [[Kaohsiung]]; the first pride in the city attracted over 2,000 people.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aall/201109200009.aspx|title=Gay pride parade set for Kaohsiung|work=Central News Agency|location=Taipei|date=20 September 2011|accessdate=24 May 2017}}</ref> The city of [[Taichung]] also holds pride parades, with the 2016 one attracting a crowd of 20,000 people.<ref>[https://hornet.com/stories/taichung-city-taiwan-celebrates-pride-record-breaking-crowd-20000/ Taichung City, Taiwan, Celebrates Pride with a Record-Breaking Crowd of 20,000], ''Focus Taiwan News Channel'', 22 December 2016</ref> The 2017 Taiwan Pride parade was attended by an estimated 123,000 people.<ref>[http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201710280029.aspx Tens of thousands march in Taipei's LGBT pride parade], ''Focus Taiwan News Channel'', 28 October 2017</ref> The 2018 parade was attended by 137,000 people.<ref name="nyt">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/world/asia/taiwan-gay-pride-parade.html|author=Chris Horton|title=Taiwan’s Gay Pride Parade Draws Thousands, as Votes on Same-Sex Marriage Near|publisher=The New York Times|date=27 October 2018}}</ref>

Representations of [[LGBT]] people in literary and cinematic works are also instrumental in promoting public awareness of LGBT people and advancing LGBT rights in Taiwan. In the 1970s, some novels regarding homosexuality were published. One of the most prominent writers is [[Pai Hsien-yung]], who introduced gay characters in his novels, the most famous being ''[[Crystal Boys]]''. More recently, some gay TV series and movies have been produced and have gained great attention among gay communities in both Taiwan and China. Examples include the TV series ''Crystal Boys'', adapted from Pai Hsien-yung's novel by the same title, and the movie ''[[Formula 17]]''. In 2005, Taiwanese director, [[Ang Lee]], directed the gay Western film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', receiving high critical acclaim and Academy Awards. ''[[Spider Lilies (film)|Spider Lilies]]'', a lesbian film directed by [[Zero Chou]], was screened at the 2007 [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. It won the [[Teddy Award]] for best gay feature film.

In the days following the same-sex marriage referendum, suicide hotlines saw a 40% increase among LGBT people, especially youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/calls-to-lgbti-helpline-jump-40-after-taiwans-failed-same-sex-marriage-vote/|title=Calls to LGBTI helpline jump 40% after Taiwan's failed same-sex marriage vote|work=Gay Star News|date=28 November 2018|last=Power|first=Shannon}}</ref>

===Rabbit God===
[[Tu'er Shen]] (兔兒神), also known as the Rabbit God (兔神), is the [[Taoism|Taoist]] ([[Chinese folk religion]]) matchmaker god for homosexual relations, and is a deity of homosexual love. In 2006, Lu Wei-ming founded a temple for Tu'er Shen in [[Yonghe District]] in [[New Taipei City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/people/2015/01/26/praying-for-a-soul-mate-at-rabbit-temple/|title=Praying for a soul mate at Rabbit Temple|work=The Star Online|date=26 January 2015|last=Gold|first=Michael}}</ref> About 9,000 gay pilgrims visit the temple each year for praying, particularly for a partner.
