The film follows the life and times of millionaire Jay Gatsby (DiCaprio) and his neighbor Nick Carraway (Maguire), who recounts his encounter with Gatsby at the height of the [[Roaring Twenties]] on [[Long Island]].

The film was highly polarizing among critics; it received alternating praise and criticism for its acting performances, soundtrack, visual style, and direction. Audiences responded more positively<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/cinemascore-gets-studios-especially-when-it-counters-critics-87701|title=CinemaScore Gets 'A' From Studios, Especially When It Counters Critics|work=TheWrap}}</ref> and Fitzgerald's granddaughter praised the film, stating "Scott would have been proud."<ref>{{cite news|last=Kendall|first=Mary Claire|title=Loving 'Gatsby' All About 'Living Fitzgerald'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryclairekendall/2013/05/10/loving-gatsby-all-about-living-fitzgerald|accessdate=May 26, 2014|newspaper=Forbes|date=May 10, 2014}}</ref> As of 2017, it is Luhrmann's highest-grossing film, grossing over $353 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=greatgatsby2012.htm|title=''The Great Gatsby'' (2013)|work=boxofficemojo.com}}</ref> At the [[86th Academy Awards]], the film won in both of its nominated categories: [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].

==Plot==
In December 1929, [[Nick Carraway]], a [[World War I]] veteran, is undergoing treatment at a [[psychiatric hospital]]. He tells his doctor about [[Jay Gatsby]], the most hopeful man he ever met. The doctor suggests he write down his thoughts since writing is Nick's passion. Nick begins cataloging the events to his doctor.

Seven years earlier, in the summer of 1922, Nick moved from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] to New York after abandoning writing. He rents a small groundskeeper's cottage in the [[North Shore (Long Island)#Gilded Era|North Shore]] village of West Egg, next to the mansion of Gatsby, a mysterious business magnate who often hosts extravagant parties. Nick has dinner with his beautiful but oppressed cousin [[Daisy Buchanan]] and her athletic, domineering husband, Tom. Daisy plays matchmaker between Nick and another guest, Jordan Baker, a famous golfer whom Nick finds attractive. When Nick returns home, he sees Gatsby standing by the harbor, reaching toward a green light coming from the Buchanan dock.

Jordan tells Nick that Tom has a mistress who lives in the "[[Flushing Meadows–Corona Park#Filling and use as a dumping ground|Valley of Ashes]]", an industrial dumping site between West Egg and [[Manhattan|the City]]. Tom takes Nick there, stopping at a garage owned by Tom's mistress, Myrtle Wilson, and her husband George.

Nick receives an invitation to one of Gatsby's parties. Upon arrival, Nick learns he is the only one who received an invitation and none of the guests have ever met Gatsby. Nick encounters Jordan, and both meet Gatsby. Gatsby later takes Nick to Manhattan for lunch. On the way, Gatsby tells Nick he is an [[Oxford University|Oxford]] graduate and war hero from a wealthy Midwestern family. They go to a [[speakeasy]], where Gatsby introduces Nick to his business partner, Meyer Wolfsheim.

Jordan tells Nick how US Army Captain Gatsby started a relationship with Daisy in 1917, just before [[United States in World War I|the US entered the war]], and is still in love with her; he throws parties hoping that Daisy might attend. Gatsby asks Nick to invite Daisy to tea. After an awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy begin an affair. Gatsby is dismayed when Daisy wants to run away with him, preferring that she get a proper divorce. He asks Nick and Jordan to accompany him to the Buchanan home, where he and Daisy plan to tell Tom that Daisy is leaving him. During the luncheon, Tom becomes suspicious of Gatsby and Daisy, but Daisy stops Gatsby from revealing anything to Tom and suggests they all go to the [[Plaza Hotel]]. Tom drives Nick and Jordan in Gatsby's car while Gatsby drives Daisy in Tom's car. Tom stops for gas at George's garage, where George tells him that he and Myrtle are moving and that he suspects Myrtle is unfaithful.

At the Plaza, Gatsby tells Tom of his affair with Daisy. Tom accuses Gatsby of having never attended Oxford and having made his fortune through [[Rum-running|bootlegging]] with mobsters. Daisy says she loves Gatsby but cannot bring herself to say she never loved Tom. Eventually, both Gatsby and Daisy leave. After fighting with George over her infidelity, Myrtle runs into the street and is fatally struck by Gatsby's car after mistaking it for Tom's. After learning about Myrtle's death, Tom tells George that the car belongs to Gatsby and that he suspects Gatsby was Myrtle's lover. Nick deduces Daisy was driving when the accident happened. Nick overhears Daisy accepting Tom's promise to take care of everything, but he does not tell Gatsby. Gatsby admits to Nick that he was born penniless; his real name is James Gatz, and he had asked Daisy to wait for him until he had made something of himself after the war; instead, she married Tom, “America's Wealthiest Bachelor”, just seven months after the war ended. He did, however attend Oxford, albeit for a brief 5 months on a special program for officers after the Armstice.

The next day, Gatsby hears the phone ringing and thinks it is Daisy. Before he can answer it, he is shot and killed by a vengeful George, who then commits suicide. Nick is the only person other than reporters, to attend Gatsby's funeral, as Daisy and Tom are leaving New York. The media paints Gatsby as Myrtle's lover and killer. This false, negative image of Gatsby's life and death infuriates Nick and from the top of the stairs at Gatsby's mansion he yells at the reporters and kicks them out of the house. Disgusted with both the city and its inhabitants, Nick leaves after taking a final walk through Gatsby's deserted mansion and reflecting on Gatsby's ability to hope. In the sanatorium, Nick finishes typing his memoir and titles it ''The Great Gatsby''.

===Screenplay===
Breanne L. Healman noted five key changes made in the novel's plot: Nick Carraway is writing from a [[sanatorium|sanitarium]], having checked himself in some time after the summer with Gatsby; he flirts with Jordan Baker but, unlike what happens in the novel, he's "too smitten with Gatsby to notice her"; Gatsby himself makes a grand entrance, whereas in the novel a few hours pass as they talk before Carraway realizes who he is; some of the racism or anti-Semitism has been toned down or removed; finally, Gatsby dies thinking his pursuit of Daisy was successful.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Healman |first1=Breanne L. |title=‘The Great Gatsby’ Book to Movie: 5 Key Differences |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/blogs/movie-talk/great-gatsby-book-movie-5-key-differences-223158382.html |website=Yahoo!

The inspiration for the film version of the Buchanan estate came from [[Old Westbury Gardens]].<ref name="martinstyle" /> The mansion exterior was built on a soundstage, with digital enhancements added.<ref name="archdig" /> The interior sets for the Buchanan mansion were inspired by the style of [[Hollywood Regency]].<ref name="martinstyle" />

The home of Nick Carraway was conceived as an intimate cottage, in contrast with the grandeur of the neighboring Gatsby mansion. Objects chosen adhered to a central theme of what the designers saw as classic Long Island. The architecture conjures [[American Craftsman|American Arts and Crafts]], with [[Gustav Stickley]]-type furnishings inside and an [[Adirondack chair|Adirondack]]-style swing out.<ref name="archdig" />

The opening scene was filmed from Rivendell Child, Adolescent and Family Unit in Concord, Sydney, only a few kilometres from Sydney 2000 Olympic Stadium.

====Costumes====
Many apparel designers were approached in collaboration of the film's costumes. ''The Great Gatsby'' achieved the iconic 1920s look by altering pieces from the [[Prada]] and [[Miu Miu]] fashion archives. Martin also collaborated with [[Brooks Brothers]] for the costumes worn by the male cast members and extras. [[Tiffany & Co.]] provided the jewelry for the film. [[Catherine Martin (designer)|Catherine Martin]] and [[Miuccia Prada]] were behind the wardrobe and worked closely together to create pieces with "the European flair that was emerging amongst the aristocratic East Coast crowds in the 1920s".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Costume historians of the period, however, said that the costumes were not authentic, but instead modernized the 1920s-era fashions to look more like modern fashions. Most prominently, the women were clothed to emphasize their breasts, such as Daisy's push-up bra, in contrast to the flat-chested fashions of the era. While the book was set in 1922, the movie included fashions from the entire decade of the 1920s and even the 1930s. Many of the fashions from archives were concepts from runways and fashion magazines that were never worn by women in real life. Martin says that she took the styles of the 1920s and made them sexier and was trying to interpret 1920s styles for a modern audience. Alice Jurow, of the Art Deco Society of California, said that she loved the movie, but most of their members prefer more period-perfect films. The men's costumes were more authentic, except that the pants were too tight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/did-hollywood-give-the-1920s-a-boob-job/ |title=Did Hollywood Give the 1920s a Boob Job?

Speaking of his goals for the movie's musical backdrop, Baz Luhrmann expressed his desire to blend the music of the [[Jazz Age]], associated with the 1922 setting of the story, with a modern spin. Much like his modern twists applied in ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' and ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'', Baz uses the movie's music not as a background, but instead prominently in the foreground, which takes on a character of its own.<ref>{{cite web|first=Rose|last=Lilah|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/tracklist-for-the-great-gatsby-soundtrack-features-new-music-from-jay-z-beyonce-andre-3000-and-more-news.5131.html|title=Tracklist For "The Great Gatsby" Soundtrack Features New Music From Jay-Z, Beyonce, Andre 3000 & More [Update: Listen to Album Snippets]|work=HotNewHipHop|date=April 16, 2013|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}</ref>

===Critical response===
On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 48% based on 298 reviews, with an average rating of 5.90/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "While certainly ambitious—and every bit as visually dazzling as one might expect—Baz Luhrmann's ''The Great Gatsby'' emphasizes visual splendor at the expense of its source material's vibrant heart."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_great_gatsby_2012/|title=The Great Gatsby (2013)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=December 4, 2020}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gives the film a score of 55 out of 100, based on reviews from 45 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-great-gatsby |title=The Great Gatsby Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=May 11, 2013}}</ref> Audiences polled by the market research firm [[CinemaScore]] gave an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="hr"/>

[[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' felt the elaborate production designs were a misfire and likened the film to the Roaring Twenties themselves as Fitzgerald envisioned and criticized them, stating that what is "intractably wrong with the film is that there's no reality to heighten; it's a spectacle in search of a soul".<ref name="WSJreview">{{cite web|first=Joe |last=Morgenstern |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324244304578472832378366420 |title=The Grating 'Gatsby' |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=May 9, 2013 |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}</ref> The ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' review felt "Luhrmann is exactly the wrong person to adapt such a delicately rendered story, and his 3D feature plays like a ghastly Roaring 20s blowout at a sorority house".<ref name="CRreview">{{cite web|first=J.R. |last=Jones |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-great-gatsby-3d/Film?oid=9376826 |title=The Great Gatsby 3D |work=[[Chicago Reader]] |date=May 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 4, 2018}}</ref> In ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Christopher Orr (film critic)|Christopher Orr]] observed that "The problem is that when the movie is entertaining it's not ''Gatsby'', and when it's ''Gatsby'' it's not entertaining."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/05/a-grating-em-great-gatsby-em/275744/|title=A Grating ''Great Gatsby''|last1=Orr |first1=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Orr (film critic)|date=May 10, 2013|website=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=December 9, 2015}}</ref>

The positive reviews included [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who felt the adaptation was "a lot of fun" and "less a conventional movie adaptation than a splashy, trashy opera, a wayward, lavishly theatrical celebration of the emotional and material extravagance that Fitzgerald surveyed with fascinated ambivalence"; Scott advised "the best way to enjoy the film is to put aside whatever literary agenda you are tempted to bring with you".<ref name="NYTreview">{{cite web|first=A.
