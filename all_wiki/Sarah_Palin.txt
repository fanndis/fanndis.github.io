===Budget, spending, and federal funds===
[[File:Sarah Palin Germany 3 Cropped Lightened.JPG|right|thumb|180px|Palin in Germany, July 2007]]
In June 2007, Palin signed a record $6.6&nbsp;billion operating budget into law.<ref name="Shinohara">{{cite news|last=Shinohara|first=Rosemary|title=No vetoes here|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News|date=July 16, 2007}}</ref> At the same time, she used her veto power to make the second-largest cuts of the capital budget in state history.

In 2008, Palin vetoed $286 million, cutting or reducing funding for 350 projects from the [[Fiscal year|FY]]09 capital budget.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/legislature/story/415749.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527181734/http://www.adn.com/legislature/story/415749.html|archivedate=May 27, 2008|access-date=September 15, 2008|title=Palin's veto ax lops $268 million from budget|last=Cockerham|first=Sean|date=May 24, 2008|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News}}</ref>

Palin followed through on a campaign promise to sell the [[IAI Westwind|Westwind II]] jet, a purchase made by the Murkowski administration for $2.7&nbsp;million in 2005 against the wishes of the legislature.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/25/us/25jet.html|title=Jet that Helped Defeat an Alaska Governor is Sold.|author=Yardley, William|work=The New York Times|date=August 25, 2007|access-date=September 18, 2008}}</ref>

====Gubernatorial expenditures====
Palin lived in Juneau during the legislative session, and lived in Wasilla and worked out of offices in Anchorage the rest of the year. Since the office in Anchorage was 565 miles from Juneau, while she worked there, state officials said she was permitted to claim a $58 [[per diem]] travel allowance and reimbursement for hotel. She filed for per diem, claiming a total of $16,951, but rather than stay at a hotel overnight, regularly commuted the 50&nbsp;miles one way to her home in Wasilla.<ref name="wash-post-nights">{{cite news|last=Grimaldi|first=James V.|authorlink=James V.

In February 2009, the State of Alaska, reversing a policy that had treated the payments as legitimate business expenses under the [[Internal Revenue Code]], decided that per diems paid to state employees for stays in their own homes would be treated as taxable income and will be included in employees' gross income on their [[Form W-2|W-2]] forms.<ref>{{cite news|title=Palin Now Owes Taxes on Payments for Nights at Home, State Rules|first=James V.|last=Grimaldi|work=The Washington Post|date=February 19, 2009|page=A04|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/18/AR2009021803177.html?nav=hcmoduletmv|accessdate=June 21, 2009}}</ref> Palin had ordered the review of the tax policy.<ref>{{cite news|first=Lisa|last=Demer|title=Palin owes tax on per diem, state says|url=http://www.adn.com/palin/story/693695.html|work=Anchorage Daily News|date=February 17, 2008|access-date=February 19, 2009|quote='At the Governor's request, we reviewed the situation to determine whether we were in full compliance with the pertinent Internal Revenue Service regulations,' Kreitzer wrote.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219152928/http://www.adn.com//palin//story//693695.html|archivedate=February 19, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In December 2008, an Alaska state commission recommended increasing the governor's annual salary from $125,000 to $150,000.

====Federal funding====
In her [[State of the State address]] on January 17, 2008, Palin declared that the people of Alaska "can and must continue to develop our economy, because we cannot and must not rely so heavily on federal government [funding]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cagw.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=11244|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113165553/http://www.cagw.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=11244|title=Alaska Begins to Grow Up|work=Wastewatcher, January 2008|publisher=Citizens Against Government Waste|first=Leslie K.|last=Paige|date=January 29, 2008|archivedate=January 13, 2009|access-date=June 12, 2011}}</ref> Alaska's federal congressional representatives cut back on [[pork-barrel]] project requests during Palin's time as governor; despite this, in 2008 Alaska was still the largest per-capita recipient of federal [[earmark (politics)|earmarks]], requesting nearly $750 million in special federal spending over a period of two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/26611103|title=McCain, Palin criticize Obama on earmarks|author=Staff|work=Decision 2008 archive – John McCain News|publisher=NBC News|date=September 8, 2008|access-date=September 16, 2008}}</ref>

While the state has no sales tax or income tax, royalty revenues from the [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]] (consisting mostly of state-owned lands) have supported large state budgets since 1980. The exact amounts have depended on the prevailing [[price of petroleum]]. As a result, state revenues doubled to $10 billion in 2008. Despite this, for the 2009 state budget, Palin gave a list of 31 proposed federal earmarks or requests for funding, totaling $197 million, to Alaska's senior U.S. Senator [[Ted Stevens]]. This was a major decrease from earlier years.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Seattle Times |title=Palin's earmark requests: more per person than any other state |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2008154532_webpalin02m.html |first=Hal |last=Bernton |author2=Heath, David |date=September 2, 2008 |access-date=June 21, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707152514/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2008154532_webpalin02m.html |archivedate=July 7, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|last=Taylor|first=Andrew|url=http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2008/09/02/1817859-palins-pork-requests-confound-reformer-image|title=Palin's pork requests confound reformer image|date=September 2, 2008|access-date=October 23, 2008}}</ref> Palin has said that her decreasing support for federal funding was a source of friction between her and the state's congressional delegation; Palin requested less in federal funding each year than her predecessor Frank Murkowski requested in his last year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/politics/story/516743.html|title=Palin's Take On Earmarks Evolving|last=Bolstad|first=Erika|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News|date=September 8, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020074550/http://www.adn.com/politics/story/516743.html|archivedate=October 20, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> <!-- The cited source says: "One thing is clear: Palin has increasingly distanced herself from earmarking since she made her first trip to Washington D.C. to lobby Congress for money in 2000.

Frank Murkowski submitted 63 earmark requests totaling $350 million, Palin's staff said. That slid to 52 earmarks valued at $256 million in Palin's first year. This year, the governor's office asked the delegation to help them land 31 earmarks valued at $197 million." -->

====Bridge to Nowhere====
{{Main|Gravina Island Bridge}}
[[File:palin nowhere.jpg|thumb|left|Palin visiting [[Ketchikan]] during her gubernatorial campaign, 2006]]
In 2002, it was proposed that a for-profit prison corporation, [[Cornell Corrections]], build a prison on the island. To connect the island with Ketchikan, it was originally planned that the federal government spend $175 million on building a bridge to the island, and another $75 million to connect it to the power grid with an electrical intertie. The Ketchikan Borough Assembly turned the proposal down when the administration of Governor Tony Knowles also expressed its disfavor to the idea. Eventually, the corporation's prison plans led to the exposure of the wide-ranging [[Alaska political corruption probe]], which eventually ensnared U.S. Senator [[Ted Stevens]]. The bridge idea persisted through the administration of former U.S. Senator, and then-governor, [[Frank Murkowski]]. The [[2005 Highway Bill]] provided for $223m to build the [[Gravina Island Bridge]] between Gravina Island and nearby [[Ketchikan]], on [[Revillagigedo Island]].

In 2007, Palin supported a 2003 [[Alaska Department of Fish and Game]] policy allowing the hunting of wolves from the air as part of a predator control program intended to increase [[moose]] and [[caribou]] populations for subsistence-food gatherers and other hunters.<ref name="AP_wolf">{{cite news| url =http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/032207/sta_20070322019.shtml| title = State puts bounty on wolves to boost predator control| work=Juneau Empire Story Archive| author = Associated Press staff| date = March 22, 2007|accessdate=February 14, 2010}}</ref><ref name="ADFG_pressrelease_20070511">{{cite press release| url = http://www.adfg.state.ak.us/news/2007/5-11-07_nr.php| title = Governor Palin Introduces Bill to Streamline Predator Management Laws| date = May 11, 2007| publisher = Alaska Department of Game and Fish| accessdate =June 21, 2009}}</ref> In March 2007, Palin's office announced that a bounty of $150 per wolf would be paid to the 180 volunteer pilots and gunners in five areas of Alaska to offset fuel costs.

Palin dismissed [[Alaska Department of Public Safety|Public Safety Commissioner]] [[Walt Monegan]] on July 11, 2008, citing performance-related issues, such as not being "a team player on budgeting issues"<ref name="Staff pushed" /> and "egregious rogue behavior."<ref>{{cite news| first=Dan| last=Fagan| date=September 16, 2008| title= No one is above the truth, even Palin| work=Opinion| publisher=Anchorage Daily News| url=http://www.adn.com/opinion/story/528420.html}}</ref> Palin attorney Thomas Van Flein said that the "last straw" was Monegan's planned trip to [[Washington, D.C.]], to seek funding for a new, multimillion-dollar sexual assault initiative the governor hadn't yet approved.<ref>{{cite news| first=Wesley| last=Loy| date=September 16, 2008| title=Palin accuses Monegan of insubordination, Troopergate: Governor's lawyer attempts to clear her of misconduct in the firing| newspaper=Anchorage Daily News| url=http://www.adn.com/troopergate/story/527346.html| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724095247/http://www.adn.com/troopergate/story/527346.html| archivedate=July 24, 2009| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Monegan said that he had resisted persistent pressure from Palin, her husband, and her staff, including [[Alaska Attorney General|state Attorney General]] [[Talis J. Colberg]], to fire Palin's ex-brother-in-law, [[Alaska State Troopers|Alaska State Trooper]] Mike Wooten; Wooten was involved in a child custody battle with Palin's sister after a bitter divorce that included an alleged death threat against Palin's father.<ref name="Demer">{{cite news| last = Demer| first = Lisa| url = http://www.adn.com/sarahpalin/story/510080.html| title = 'Troopergate' inquiry hangs over campaign| newspaper = Anchorage Daily News| date = August 30, 2008| quote = For the record, no one ever said fire Wooten.

Monegan said the subject of Wooten came up when he invited Palin to a birthday party for his cousin, state senator [[Lyman Hoffman]], in February 2007 during the legislative session in [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]]. "As we were walking down the stairs in the capitol building she wanted to talk to me about her former brother-in-law," Monegan said. "I said, 'Ma'am, I need to keep you at arm's length with this.

Palin said there was "absolutely no pressure ever put on Commissioner Monegan to hire or fire anybody, at any time. I did not abuse my office powers. And I don't know how to be more blunt and candid and honest, but to tell you that truth. To tell you that no pressure was ever put on anybody to fire anybody." Todd Palin gave a similar account.<ref>{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Simon|date=November 7, 2008|url=http://www.ktva.com/news/local/Monegan-Says-Palin-Administration-Husband-Used-Governors-Office-to-Pressure-Firing-First-Familys-Former-Brother-in-Law-116778328.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928040453/http://www.ktva.com/news/local/Monegan-Says-Palin-Administration-Husband-Used-Governors-Office-to-Pressure-Firing-First-Familys-Former-Brother-in-Law-116778328.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 28, 2011|title=Monegan Says Palin Administration, Husband Used Governor's Office to Pressure Firing First Family's Former Brother-in-Law|publisher=KTVA, CBS News 11|accessdate=July 1, 2011}}</ref>

On August 13, she acknowledged that a half dozen members of her administration had made more than two dozen calls on the matter to various state officials.

Chuck Kopp, whom Palin had appointed to replace Monegan as public safety commissioner, received a $10,000 state [[severance package]] after he resigned following just two weeks on the job. Kopp, the former [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]] [[chief of police]], resigned July 25 following disclosure of a 2005 sexual harassment complaint and letter of reprimand against him. Monegan said that he did not receive a severance package from the state.<ref name="Staff pushed"/>

====Legislative investigation====
On August 1, 2008, the [[Alaska Legislature]] hired an investigator, Stephen Branchflower, to review the Monegan dismissal. Legislators stated that Palin had the legal authority to fire Monegan, but they wanted to know whether her action had been motivated by anger at Monegan for not firing Wooten.<ref name="narrative">{{cite news|last=Espo|first=David|title=Palin probe has parallels to 2000 recount fight|work=Boston Globe|date=September 19, 2008|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/articles/2008/09/19/palin_probe_has_parallels_to_2000_recount_fight|accessdate=June 21, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104173021/http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2008/articles/2008/09/19/palin_probe_has_parallels_to_2000_recount_fight|archivedate=January 4, 2009}}</ref> The atmosphere was bipartisan and Palin pledged to cooperate.<ref name="narrative"/><ref name="HiredHelp">{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/monegan/story/478090.html|title=Hired help will probe Monegan dismissal|author=Loy, Wesley|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News|date=July 29, 2008|accessdate=August 29, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831213521/http://www.adn.com/monegan/story/478090.html|archivedate=August 31, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Wooten remained employed as a state trooper.<ref name="IsWootenGood">{{cite news|title=Is Wooten a good trooper?|author=Demer, Lisa|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News|page=A1|date=July 27, 2008}}</ref> She placed an aide on paid leave due to a tape-recorded phone conversation that she deemed improper, in which the aide, appearing to act on her behalf, complained to a trooper that Wooten had not been fired.<ref name="Bailey">{{cite news|url=http://community.adn.com/adn/node/128981|last=Hulen|first=David|title=Namely, specifically, most disturbing, is a telephone recording apparently made and preserved by the troopers...|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News|date=August 13, 2008|accessdate=June 21, 2009}}</ref>
