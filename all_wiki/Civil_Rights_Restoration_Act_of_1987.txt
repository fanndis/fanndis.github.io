The '''Civil Rights Restoration Act''', or '''Grove City Bill''', was a [[US|United States]] legislative act that specified that recipients of federal funds must comply with civil rights laws in all areas, not just in the particular program or activity that received federal funding. The Act was first passed by the House in June 1984 (375–32) but failed to pass in either chamber after divisions occurred within the civil rights coalition over the issue of [[abortion]].<ref name="Graham p. 419">{{cite journal|first=Hugh Davis|last=Graham|title=The Storm Over Grove City College: Civil Rights Regulation, Higher Education, and the Reagan Administration|journal=[[History of Education Quarterly]]|volume=38|issue=2|year=1998|page=419|doi=10.2307/369849|jstor=369849}}</ref> In January 1988, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] accepted an amendment by Senator [[John Danforth]] (R-MO), which added "abortion-neutral" language to the Bill, a move opposed by the [[National Organization for Women]] but resulted in passage of the bill in both houses.

The final vote in the Senate on January 28, 1988 was 75–14 (48–0 in the [[Senate Democratic Caucus]] and 27–14 in the [[Senate Republican Conference]]) with 11 members voting present or abstaining,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/100-1988/s432|title=TO PASS S 557, CIVIL RIGHTS RESTORATION ACT, A BILL TO RESTORE THE BROAD COVERAGE AND CLARIFY FOUR CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS BY PROVIDING THAT IF ONE PART OF AN INSTITUTION IS FEDERALLY FUNDED, THEN THE ENTIRE INSTITUTION MUST NOT DISCRIMINATE.}}</ref> while the final vote in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on March 2, 1988 was 315–98 (242–4 in the [[House Democratic Caucus]] and 73–94 in the [[House Republican Conference]]) with 20 members voting present or abstaining.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/100-1988/h506|title=TO PASS S 557, CIVIL RIGHTS RESTORATION ACT, A BILL TO RESTORE THE BROAD COVERAGE AND CLARIFY FOUR CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS BY PROVIDING THAT IF ONE PART OF AN INSTITUTION IS FEDERALLY- FUNDED, THEN THE ENTIRE INSTITUTION MUST NOT DISCRIMINATE.}}</ref> On March 16, 1988, President [[Ronald Reagan]] vetoed the bill, as he had promised to do. On March 22, 1988, the Senate overrode Reagan's veto by a vote of 73–24 (52–0 in the [[Senate Democratic Caucus]] and 21–24 in the [[Senate Republican Conference]]) with 3 members voting present or abstaining,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/100-1988/s487|title=TO ADOPT, OVER THE PRESIDENT'S VETO OF S 557, CIVIL RIGHTS RESTORATION ACT, A BILL TO RESTORE BROAD COVERAGE OF FOUR CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS BY DECLARING THAT IF ONE PART OF AN INSTITUTION RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDS, THEN THE ENTIRE INSTITUTION MUST NOT DISCRIMINATE.

VETO OVERRIDDEN; TWO-THIRDS OF THOSE PRESENT VOTING IN FAVOR.}}</ref>

Reagan's veto was the first veto of a civil rights act since [[Andrew Johnson]] vetoed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]]. The passage of this bill thus overturned the [[US Supreme Court]]'s 1984 decision in ''[[Grove City College v. Bell]].'' It applies to [[Title IX]] of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]], the [[1973 Rehabilitation Act]], Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], and the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]].
