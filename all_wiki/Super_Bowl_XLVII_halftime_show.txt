A countdown to the halftime show began under the music for "[[Countdown (Beyoncé song)|Countdown]]". It then opened with an instrumental portion of "[[Run the World (Girls)]]" and Beyoncé ascended on a stage lift while a [[Vince Lombardi]] speech was heard in the background:

Then Beyoncé started singing an [[a cappella]] version of the chorus of "[[Love on Top]]" which later led to a performance of "[[Crazy in Love]]" when as stated by Jon Caramanica of ''The New York Times'' Beyoncé was "virtually growling, giving that song a ferocity it has never before had".<ref name="nyreview" /> Beyoncé went on the perform "[[End of Time (song)|End of Time]]" which began with stomping dance.<ref name="nyreview" /> A performance of "[[Baby Boy (Beyoncé song)|Baby Boy]]" followed when Beyoncé danced while screens behind and below her projected [[cloning|clones]] of herself dancing the same choreography.<ref name="nyreview" /> Former [[Destiny's Child]] members [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] joined her on stage, after being launched off the floor to perform "[[Bootylicious]]" and "[[Independent Women|Independent Women Part I]]" from the ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]] '' soundtrack which they finished with a pose in the form of the film's lead female characters.<ref name="rollstone">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beyonce-rocks-super-bowl-halftime-show-with-destinys-child-20130203|title=Beyoncé Rocks Super Bowl Halftime Show With Destiny's Child|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]|first=Dan|last=Hyman|date=February 3, 2013|accessdate=March 18, 2013}}</ref> They continued with a version of Beyoncé's "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]".

{{Quote box|width=27em|align=right|quote="Why would you ever have a Super Bowl without Beyoncé? Now ''that'' was a halftime show, and ''that'' is a star. This woman single-handedly blew out the power in the Superdome.
