The Pagan Kingdom fell to [[First Mongol invasion of Burma|Mongol invasions]], and several warring states emerged.

In April 2016, soon after taking office, Aung San Suu Kyi said concerning the question of which name should be used that, "it is up to you, because there is nothing in the constitution of our country that says that you must use any term in particular".

=== Early city-states ===
{{Main|Pyu city-states|Mon kingdoms}}
Around the second century BCE the first-known [[city-state]]s emerged in central Myanmar. The city-states were founded as part of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu people, the earliest inhabitants of Myanmar of whom records are extant, from present-day [[Yunnan]].<ref name=EarlyYunnan>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=D.G.E.|title=Burma|edition=3rd|year=1960|publisher=Hutchinson University Library|isbn=978-1-4067-3503-1|pages=8–10}}<br />{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Elizabeth H.|title=Early Landscapes of Myanmar|year=2007|publisher=River Books|location=Bangkok|isbn=978-974-9863-31-2|page=236}}</ref> The Pyu culture was heavily influenced by trade with India, importing Buddhism as well as other cultural, architectural and political concepts, which would have an enduring influence on later Burmese culture and political organisation.<ref>[[#Myint-U|Myint-U]], pp. 51–52</ref>

By the 9th century, several city-states had sprouted across the land: the Pyu in the central dry zone, Mon along the southern coastline and Arakanese along the western littoral. The balance was upset when the Pyu came under repeated attacks from [[Nanzhao]] between the 750s and the 830s. In the mid-to-late 9th century the [[Bamar people]] founded a small settlement at [[Bagan]]. It was one of several competing city-states until the late 10th century when it grew in authority and grandeur.<ref>[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], pp. 90–91</ref>

[[File:Bagan, Burma.jpg|thumb|[[Pagoda]]s and [[kyaung]]s in present-day [[Bagan]], the capital of the [[Pagan Kingdom]].]]
Pagan gradually grew to absorb its surrounding states until the 1050s–1060s when [[Anawrahta]] founded the [[Pagan Kingdom]], the first ever unification of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Pagan Empire and the [[Khmer Empire]] were two main powers in mainland Southeast Asia.<ref>[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], p. 24</ref> The [[Burmese language]] and culture gradually became dominant in the upper Irrawaddy valley, eclipsing the [[Pyu language (Burma)|Pyu]], [[Mon language|Mon]] and [[Pali]] norms by the late 12th century.<ref name=mha-63-65>{{cite book | last=Htin Aung | first=Maung | title=A History of Burma | url=https://archive.org/details/historyofburma00htin | url-access=registration | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York and London | year=1967|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofburma00htin/page/63 63–65]}}</ref> Theravada Buddhism slowly began to spread to the village level, although [[Vajrayana|Tantric]], [[Mahayana]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Burmese folk religion|folk religion]] remained heavily entrenched. Pagan's rulers and wealthy built over 10,000 Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital zone alone. Repeated Mongol invasions in the late 13th century toppled the four-century-old kingdom in 1287.<ref name="mha-63-65" />

[[File:MysticalMraukU.jpg|thumb|Temples at [[Mrauk U]].]]
Pagan's collapse was followed by 250 years of political fragmentation that lasted well into the 16th century. Like the Burmans four centuries earlier, [[Shan people|Shan migrants]] who arrived with the Mongol invasions stayed behind. Several competing [[Shan States]] came to dominate the entire northwestern to eastern arc surrounding the Irrawaddy valley. The valley too was beset with petty states until the late 14th century when two sizeable powers, [[Kingdom of Ava|Ava Kingdom]] and [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom]], emerged. In the west, a politically fragmented Arakan was under competing influences of its stronger neighbours until the [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] unified the Arakan coastline for the first time in 1437. The kingdom was a protectorate of the [[Bengal Sultanate]] at different time periods.<ref name=kh-2-25>Maung Maung Tin, Vol. 2, p. 25</ref>

In the 14th and 15th centuries, Ava fought [[Forty Years' War|wars of unification]] but could never quite reassemble the lost empire. Having held off Ava, the [[Mon people|Mon]]-speaking Hanthawaddy entered its golden age, and Arakan went on to become a power in its own right for the next 350 years. In contrast, constant warfare left Ava greatly weakened, and it slowly disintegrated from 1481 onward. In 1527, the Confederation of Shan States conquered Ava and ruled Upper Myanmar until 1555.

Like the Pagan Empire, Ava, Hanthawaddy and the Shan states were all multi-ethnic polities. Despite the wars, cultural synchronisation continued. This period is considered a golden age for [[Culture of Myanmar|Burmese culture]]. [[Burmese literature]] "grew more confident, popular, and stylistically diverse", and the second generation of Burmese law codes as well as the earliest [[Burmese chronicles|pan-Burma chronicles]] emerged.<ref>[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], p. 134</ref> Hanthawaddy monarchs introduced religious reforms that later spread to the rest of the country.<ref>[[#Myint-U|Myint-U]], pp. 64–65</ref> Many splendid temples of Mrauk U were built during this period.

=== Taungoo and colonialism ===
[[File:Map of Taungoo Empire (1580).png|thumb|[[First Toungoo Empire|Toungoo Empire]] under [[Bayinnaung]] in 1580.]]
Political unification returned in the mid-16th century, through the efforts of [[Toungoo dynasty|Taungoo]], a former vassal state of Ava. Taungoo's young, ambitious King [[Tabinshwehti]] defeated the more powerful Hanthawaddy in the [[Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War (1534–1541)|Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War]]. His successor [[Bayinnaung]] went on to conquer a vast swath of mainland Southeast Asia including the Shan states, [[Lan Na]], Manipur, [[Mong Mao]], the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], [[Lan Xang]] and southern Arakan. However, the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia unravelled soon after Bayinnaung's death in 1581, completely collapsing by 1599. Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na, and Portuguese mercenaries established [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese rule]] at [[Thanlyin]] (Syriam).

The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom, encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan Na and upper [[Tenasserim Division|Tenasserim]]. The restored Toungoo kings created a legal and political framework whose basic features continued well into the 19th century. The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with repeated [[Meitei people|Meithei]] raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower Myanmar founded the [[Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom]]. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.

[[File:Shwedagon pagoda.jpg|thumb|A British 1825 lithograph of [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] shows British occupation during the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]].]]
After the fall of Ava, the [[Konbaung–Hanthawaddy War]] involved one resistance group under [[Alaungpaya]] defeating the Restored Hanthawaddy, and by 1759 he had reunited all of Myanmar and Manipur and driven out the French and the British, who had provided arms to Hanthawaddy. By 1770, Alaungpaya's heirs had subdued much of Laos and fought and won the [[Burmese–Siamese War (1765–1767)|Burmese–Siamese War]] against Ayutthaya and the [[Sino-Burmese War (1765–1769)|Sino-Burmese War]] against [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]].<ref>[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], pp. 184–187</ref>

With Burma preoccupied by the Chinese threat, Ayutthaya recovered its territories by 1770 and went on to capture Lan Na by 1776. Burma and Siam went to war until 1855, but all resulted in a stalemate, exchanging Tenasserim (to Burma) and Lan Na (to Ayutthaya). Faced with a powerful China and a resurgent Ayutthaya in the east, King [[Bodawpaya]] turned west, acquiring Arakan (1785), Manipur (1814) and Assam (1817). It was the second-largest empire in Burmese history but also one with a long ill-defined border with [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]].<ref>[[#Myint-U|Myint-U]], p. 109</ref>

The breadth of this empire was short lived. In 1826, Burma lost Arakan, [[Manipur]], Assam and Tenasserim to the British in the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]. In 1852, the British easily seized Lower Burma in the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]]. King [[Mindon Min]] tried to modernise the kingdom and in 1875 narrowly avoided annexation by ceding the [[Karenni States]]. The British, alarmed by the consolidation of [[French Indochina]], annexed the remainder of the country in the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1885.
[[File:Elefante Portugues.jpg|thumb|Portuguese ruler of Pegu riding an Elephant in the 17th century.]]
Konbaung kings extended Restored Toungoo's administrative reforms and achieved unprecedented levels of internal control and external expansion. For the first time in history, the Burmese language and culture came to predominate the entire Irrawaddy valley. The evolution and growth of Burmese literature and theatre continued, aided by an extremely high adult male literacy rate for the era (half of all males and 5% of females).<ref>[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], pp. 202–206</ref> Nonetheless, the extent and pace of reforms were uneven and ultimately proved insufficient to stem the advance of British colonialism.

In the 18th century Burmese rulers, whose country had not previously been of particular interest to European traders, sought to maintain their traditional influence in the western areas of Assam, Manipur and Arakan. Pressing them, however, was the British East India Company, which was expanding its interests eastwards over the same territory. Over the next sixty years, diplomacy, raids, treaties and compromises, known collectively as the [[Anglo-Burmese Wars]], continued until Britain proclaimed control over most of Burma.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=287|isbn=978-1-107-50718-0}}</ref> With the fall of Mandalay, all of Burma came under British rule, being [[Third Anglo-Burmese War#Annexation and resistance|annexed]] on 1 January 1886.

Throughout the colonial era, many Indians arrived as soldiers, civil servants, construction workers and traders and, along with the [[Anglo-Burmese people|Anglo-Burmese]] community, dominated commercial and civil life in Burma. [[Yangon|Rangoon]] became the capital of British Burma and an important port between [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and [[Singapore]]. Burmese resentment was strong and was vented in violent riots that paralysed Rangoon on occasion all the way until the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book | first=Maurice | last=Collis | year=1945 | title=Trials in Burma}}</ref> Some of the discontent was caused by a disrespect for Burmese culture and traditions such as the British refusal to remove shoes when they entered pagodas. Buddhist monks became the vanguards of the independence movement. [[U Wisara]], an activist monk, died in prison after a 166-day hunger strike to protest against a rule that forbade him to wear his Buddhist robes while imprisoned.<ref>{{cite book | first=Heinz | last=Bechert | year=1984 | title=The World of Buddhism-Buddhist Monks and Nuns in Society and Culture | isbn=978-0-87196-982-8 | publisher=Facts on File | location=New York, N.Y. | url=https://archive.org/details/worldofbuddhismb00bech }}</ref>

==== Separation of British Burma from British India ====
On 1 April 1937, Burma became a separately administered colony of Great Britain, and [[Ba Maw]] became the first Prime Minister and Premier of Burma. Ba Maw was an outspoken advocate for Burmese self-rule, and he opposed the participation of Great Britain, and by extension Burma, in [[World War II]]. He resigned from the Legislative Assembly and was arrested for sedition. In 1940, before [[Japan during World War II|Japan formally entered the war]], [[Aung San]] formed the [[Burma Independence Army]] in Japan.

As a major battleground, Burma was devastated during World War II by the [[Japanese invasion of Burma|Japanese invasion]]. Within months after they entered the war, Japanese troops had advanced on Rangoon, and the British administration had collapsed.

On [[Independence Day (Myanmar)|4 January 1948]], the nation became an independent republic, under the terms of the [[Burma Independence Act 1947]]. The new country was named the ''Union of Burma'', with [[Sao Shwe Thaik]] as its first president and [[U Nu]] as its first prime minister. Unlike most other former British colonies and overseas territories, Burma did not become a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. A [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament was formed, consisting of a [[Chamber of Deputies (Burma)|Chamber of Deputies]] and a [[Chamber of Nationalities]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.dvb.no/e_docs/511947_con.htm|title=The Constitution of the Union of Burma|accessdate=7 July 2006|year=1947|publisher=DVB| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615072018/http://english.dvb.no/e_docs/511947_con.htm|archive-date=15 June 2006}}</ref> and [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] elections were held in [[1951–52 Burmese general election|1951–1952]], [[1956 Burmese general election|1956]] and [[1960 Burmese general election|1960]].

The geographical area Burma encompasses today can be traced to the [[Panglong Agreement]], which combined Burma Proper, which consisted of Lower Burma and Upper Burma, and the Frontier Areas, which had been administered separately by the British.<ref>{{cite book |first=Martin |last=Smith |year=1991 |title=Burma -Insurgency and the Politics of Ethnicity |publisher=Zed Books |location=London and New Jersey |pages=42–43}}</ref>

When the non-Burman ethnic groups pushed for autonomy or federalism, alongside having a weak civilian government at the centre, the military leadership staged a coup d’état in 1962. Though incorporated in the 1947 Constitution, successive military governments construed the use of the term ‘federalism’ as being anti-national, anti-unity and pro-disintegration.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-united-states-of-myanmar/article18525853.ece |title=The united states of Myanmar? |newspaper=The Hindu |date=23 May 2017 |accessdate=9 September 2017|last1=Kipgen |first1=Nehginpao }}</ref>

=== Military rule (1962–2011) ===
On 2 March 1962, the military led by General [[Ne Win]] [[1962 Burmese coup d'état|took control of Burma through a coup d'état]], and the government has been under direct or indirect control by the military since then. Between 1962 and 1974, Myanmar was ruled by a [[Union Revolutionary Council|revolutionary council]] headed by the general. Almost all aspects of society (business, media, production) were [[Nationalization|nationalised]] or brought under government control under the [[Burmese Way to Socialism]],<ref name="thantmyintu">[[#Myint-U|Myint-U]]</ref> which combined Soviet-style nationalisation and [[Economic planning|central planning]].

A new [[Constitution of Myanmar|constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma]] was adopted in 1974. Until 1988, the country was ruled as a [[One-party state|one-party system]], with the general and other military officers resigning and ruling through the [[Burma Socialist Programme Party]] (BSPP).<ref name="christinafink">{{cite book |first=Christina |last=Fink |year=2001 |title=Living Silence: Burma under Military Rule |isbn=978-1-85649-926-2 |publisher=White Lotus |location=Bangkok |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/livingsilence00chri }}</ref> During this period, Myanmar became one of the world's most impoverished countries.<ref name="ruin">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/28/burma.uk |title=The Burma road to ruin |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Mark |last=Tallentire |date=28 September 2007}}</ref> There were sporadic protests against military rule during the Ne Win years, and these were almost always violently suppressed. On 7 July 1962, the government broke up [[1962 Rangoon University protests|demonstrations at Rangoon University]], killing 15 students.<ref name="thantmyintu" /> In 1974, the military violently suppressed [[U Thant funeral crisis|anti-government protests]] at the funeral of U Thant. Student protests in 1975, 1976, and 1977 were quickly suppressed by overwhelming force.<ref name="christinafink" />

[[File:8888 Uprising.jpg|right|thumb|Protesters gathering in central [[Rangoon]], 1988.]]
In 1988, unrest over economic mismanagement and political oppression by the government led to widespread pro-democracy demonstrations throughout the country known as the [[8888 Uprising]]. Security forces killed thousands of demonstrators, and General [[Saw Maung]] staged a coup d'état and formed the [[State Peace and Development Council|State Law and Order Restoration Council]] (SLORC). In 1989, SLORC declared martial law after widespread protests. The military government finalised plans for People's Assembly elections on 31 May 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs/pyithu_hluttaw_election_law.htm |title=Pyithu Hluttaw Election Law |access-date=11 July 2006 |date=31 May 1989 |work=State Law and Order Restoration Council |publisher=iBiblio.org}}</ref> SLORC changed the country's official English name from the "Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma" to the "Union of Myanmar" in 18 June 1989 by enacting the adaptation of the expression law.

In May 1990, the government held free elections for the first time in almost 30 years, and the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD), the party of Aung San Suu Kyi, [[1990 Myanmar general election|won 392 out of a total 492 seats]] (i.e., 80% of the seats). However, the military junta refused to cede power<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs/Elections-02.htm |title=1990 Multi-party Democracy General Elections |author=Han, Khin Kyaw |date=1 February 2003 |work=National League for Democracy |publisher=iBiblio.org}}</ref> and continued to rule the nation as SLORC until 1997, and then as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) until its dissolution in March 2011. On 23 June 1997, Myanmar was admitted into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. On 27 March 2006, the military junta, which had moved the national capital from Yangon to a site near [[Pyinmana]] in November 2005, officially named the new capital [[Naypyidaw]], meaning "city of the kings".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4848408.stm |title=Burma's new capital stages parade|work=BBC News|date=27 March 2006|accessdate=24 June 2006}}</ref>

=== Civil wars ===
{{Main|Internal conflict in Myanmar}}
Civil wars have been a constant feature of Myanmar's socio-political landscape since the attainment of independence in 1948. These wars are predominantly struggles for ethnic and sub-national autonomy, with the areas surrounding the ethnically Bamar central districts of the country serving as the primary geographical setting of conflict. Foreign journalists and visitors require a special travel permit to visit the areas in which Myanmar's civil wars continue.<ref>{{cite web|title=Restricted Areas in Burma|url=http://www.tourismburma.com/restricted-areas-in-burma/|publisher=Tourism Burma|accessdate=27 March 2013|year=2013|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102230338/http://www.tourismburma.com/restricted-areas-in-burma/|archive-date=2 January 2013}}</ref>

=== Democratic reforms ===
{{Main|2011–12 Burmese political reforms}}
The goal of the [[2008 Myanmar constitutional referendum|Burmese constitutional referendum of 2008]], held on 10 May 2008, is the creation of a "discipline-flourishing democracy". As part of the referendum process, the name of the country was changed from the "Union of Myanmar" to the "Republic of the Union of Myanmar", and general elections were held under the new constitution in 2010. Observer accounts of the 2010 election describe the event as mostly peaceful; however, allegations of polling station irregularities were raised, and the United Nations (UN) and a number of Western countries condemned the elections as fraudulent.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2064470,00.html | title=The Slow Thaw of Burma's Notorious Military Junta |work=The Times |location=UK | access-date=1 September 2011 | author=Marshall, Andrew | date=11 April 2011}}</ref>

Opinions differ whether the transition to [[liberal democracy]] is underway. According to some reports, the military's presence continues as the label "disciplined democracy" suggests. This label asserts that the Burmese military is allowing certain civil liberties while clandestinely institutionalising itself further into [[Politics of Myanmar|Burmese politics]]. Such an assertion assumes that reforms only occurred when the military was able to safeguard its own interests through the transition—here, "transition" does not refer to a transition to a liberal democracy but transition to a quasi-military rule.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0095327X13492943| title = Burma's Transition to Quasi-Military Rule: From Rulers to Guardians?| journal = Armed Forces & Society| volume = 40| issue = 4| page = 742| year = 2013| last1 = Bunte | first1 = M.| s2cid = 146890879}}</ref>

Since the 2010 election, the government has embarked on a series of reforms to direct the country towards liberal democracy, a [[mixed economy]], and reconciliation, although doubts persist about the motives that underpin such reforms. The series of reforms includes the release of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, the establishment of the [[Myanmar National Human Rights Commission|National Human Rights Commission]], the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners, new labour laws that permit labour unions and strikes, a relaxation of press censorship, and the regulation of currency practices.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15303968 | title=Obstacles lie ahead in Burma's bid for reform |publisher=BBC | date=19 November 2011 | access-date=20 November 2011 | author=Loyn, David }}</ref>

{{Main|Geography of Myanmar}}

[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map MMR present.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Myanmar map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Myanmar has a total area of {{convert|678500|km2}}. It lies between latitudes [[9th parallel north|9°]] and [[29th parallel north|29°N]], and longitudes [[92nd meridian east|92°]] and [[102nd meridian east|102°E]]. Myanmar is bordered in the northwest by the [[Chittagong Division]] of [[Bangladesh]] and the [[Mizoram]], Manipur, [[Nagaland]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] states of India. Its north and northeast border is with the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and [[Yunnan]] for a Sino-Myanmar border total of {{convert|2185|km|abbr=on}}. It is bounded by [[Laos]] and [[Thailand]] to the southeast. Myanmar has {{convert|1930|km|abbr=on}} of contiguous coastline along the [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[Andaman Sea]] to the southwest and the south, which forms one quarter of its total perimeter.{{r|World Factbook}}

In the north, the [[Hengduan Mountains]] form the border with China.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Myanmar}}

{{Burma Administrative Divisions Image Map}}
Myanmar is divided into seven states ({{my|ပြည်နယ်}}) and seven regions ({{my|တိုင်းဒေသကြီး}}), formerly called divisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar/index.htm |title=Myanmar.

States, in essence, are regions that are home to particular ethnic minorities. The administrative divisions are further subdivided into [[Districts of Myanmar|districts]], which are further subdivided into townships, [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]], and villages.

Below are the number of districts, townships, cities/towns, wards, village groups and villages in each division and state of Myanmar as of 31 December 2001:<ref>''List of Districts, Townships, Cities/Towns, Wards, Village Groups and Villages in Union of Myanmar'' published by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of Union of Myanmar on 31 December 2001</ref>

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Myanmar}}
Much of the country lies between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Equator]]. It lies in the [[monsoon]] region of Asia, with its coastal regions receiving over {{convert|5000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rain annually. Annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] in the [[river delta|delta]] region is approximately {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, while average annual rainfall in the dry zone in central Myanmar is less than {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The northern regions of Myanmar are the coolest, with average temperatures of {{convert|21|C|F}}. Coastal and delta regions have an average maximum temperature of {{convert|32|C|F|1}}.<ref name="myatthein" />

Myanmar continues to perform badly in the global [[Environmental Performance Index]] (EPI) with an overall ranking of 153 out of 180 countries in 2016; among the worst in the South Asian region, only ahead of Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The EPI was established in 2001 by the [[World Economic Forum]] as a global gauge to measure how well individual countries perform in implementing the United Nations' [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. The environmental areas where Myanmar performs worst (ie. highest ranking) are [[Air pollution|air quality]] (174), health impacts of environmental issues (143) and biodiversity and habitat (142). Myanmar performs best (ie. lowest ranking) in [[Environmental impact of fishing|environmental impacts of fisheries]] (21) but with declining fish stocks. Despite several issues, Myanmar also ranks 64 and scores very good (ie. a high percentage of 93.73%) in environmental effects of the agricultural industry because of an excellent management of the [[nitrogen cycle]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://epi.yale.edu/reports/2016-report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204021925/http://epi.yale.edu/reports/2016-report|url-status=dead|archive-date=4 February 2016|title=2016 Report|journal=EPI Report|access-date=17 December 2016}}</ref><ref>EPI (2016): [http://epi.yale.edu/country/myanmar Myanmar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424221820/http://epi.yale.edu/country/myanmar |date=24 April 2017 }}</ref> Myanmar is one of the most highly vulnerable countries to climate change; this poses a number of social, political, economic and foreign policy challenges to the country.<ref>Overland, I. et al.

==== Flora and fauna ====
{{Main|Wildlife of Myanmar}}
Myanmar's slow economic growth has contributed to the preservation of much of its environment and ecosystems. Forests, including dense tropical growth and valuable [[teak]] in lower Myanmar, cover over 49% of the country, including areas of [[acacia]], [[bamboo]], [[Hopea odorata|ironwood]] and ''[[Magnolia champaca]]''. [[Coconut]] and [[Areca catechu|betel palm]] and rubber have been introduced. In the highlands of the north, oak, pine and various rhododendrons cover much of the land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.burmalibrary.org/reg.burma/archives/199909/msg00690.html |title=Myanmar's Forest Law and Rules n|publisher=BurmaLibrary.org |access-date=15 July 2006}}</ref>

Heavy logging since the new 1995 forestry law went into effect has seriously reduced forest acreage and wildlife habitat.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reid |first1=Robert |last2=Bindloss |first2=Joseph |last3=Butler |first3=Stuart |year=2009 |chapter=Environment: National Parks |title=Myanmar (Burma) |edition=10th |publisher=Lonely Planet |location=Footscray, Victoria, Australia |page=[https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetmyan00joeb/page/85 85] |isbn=978-1-74104-718-9 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetmyan00joeb |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/lonelyplanetmyan00joeb/page/85 }}</ref> The lands along the coast support all varieties of tropical fruits and once had large areas of [[Myanmar Coast mangroves|mangroves]] although much of the protective mangroves have disappeared. In much of central Myanmar (the dry zone), vegetation is sparse and stunted.

Typical jungle animals, particularly tigers, occur sparsely in Myanmar. In upper Myanmar, there are [[rhinoceros]], [[wild water buffalo]], [[clouded leopard]], wild boars, deer, antelope, and elephants, which are also tamed or bred in captivity for use as work animals, particularly in the lumber industry. Smaller mammals are also numerous, ranging from gibbons and monkeys to flying foxes. The abundance of birds is notable with over 800 species, including [[Rose-ringed parakeet|parrots]], [[myna]], [[peafowl]], [[red junglefowl]], weaverbirds, crows, herons, and [[barn owl]]. Among reptile species there are [[crocodile]]s, [[gecko]]s, [[cobra]]s, [[Burmese python]]s, and turtles. Hundreds of species of freshwater fish are wide-ranging, plentiful and are very important food sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-culture/myanmar-flora-fauna.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20060923162044/http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-culture/myanmar-flora-fauna.htm |archive-date=23 September 2006 |title="Flora and Fauna" at |publisher=Myanmars.net |access-date=17 April 2010}}</ref>

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Myanmar}}
[[File:Myanmar-Lower-House-Parliament.jpg|right|thumb|[[Assembly of the Union]] (Pyidaungsu Hluttaw)]]
The constitution of Myanmar, its third since independence, was drafted by its military rulers and published in September 2008. The country is governed as a [[parliamentary system]] with a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] (with an executive [[President of Myanmar|president]] accountable to the legislature), with 25% of the legislators appointed by the military and the rest elected in general elections.

The legislature, called the [[Assembly of the Union]], is bicameral and made up of two houses: the 224-seat upper [[House of Nationalities]] and the 440-seat lower [[House of Representatives (Myanmar)|House of Representatives]]. The upper house consists 168 members who are directly elected and 56 who are appointed by the Burmese Armed Forces. The lower house consists of 330 members who are directly elected and 110 who are appointed by the armed forces.

=== Political culture ===
The major political parties are the [[National League for Democracy]] and the [[Union Solidarity and Development Party]].

Myanmar's army-drafted constitution was approved in a [[2008 Burmese constitutional referendum|referendum]] in May 2008. The results, 92.4% of the 22 million voters with an official turnout of 99%, are considered suspect by many international observers and by the National League of Democracy with reports of widespread [[Electoral fraud|fraud]], ballot stuffing, and voter intimidation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-33587120080515 |title=Reuters, Cyclone-hit Myanmar says 92 percent back charter |agency=Reuters |date=15 May 2008 |access-date=17 April 2010}}</ref>

The [[2010 Myanmar general election|elections of 2010]] resulted in a victory for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party.

Myanmar's recent political history is underlined by its struggle to establish democratic structures amidst conflicting factions. This political transition from a closely held military rule to a free democratic system is widely believed to be determining the future of Myanmar. The resounding victory of Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy in 2015 general elections has raised hope for a successful culmination of this transition.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://asianleadershipcentre.org/asian-review/myanmar-under-transition | title=Myanmar under Transition |publisher=Asian Review | access-date=9 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36732270 | title=Hundred days of Myanmar's democracy |work=BBC News | access-date=9 February 2017| date=8 July 2016 | last1=Fisher | first1=Jonah }}</ref>

The [[Rohingya people]] have consistently faced human rights abuses by the Burmese regime that has refused to acknowledge them as Burmese citizens (despite some of them having lived in Burma for over three generations)—the Rohingya have been denied Burmese citizenship since the enactment of a [[Myanmar nationality law|1982 citizenship law]].<ref name=rohingya>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7872635.stm|title=What drive the Rohingya to sea? |publisher=BBC |date=5 February 2009|access-date=29 July 2012| author=Head, Jonathan }}</ref> The law created three categories of citizenship: citizenship, associate citizenship, and naturalised citizenship. Citizenship is given to those who belong to one of the national races such as Kachin, Kayah (Karenni), Karen, Chin, Burman, Mon, Rakhine, Shan, Kaman, or Zerbadee. Associate citizenship is given to those who cannot prove their ancestors settled in Myanmar before 1823 but can prove they have one grandparent, or pre-1823 ancestor, who was a citizen of another country, as well as people who applied for citizenship in 1948 and qualified then by those laws.

Media censorship was significantly eased in August 2012 following demonstrations by hundreds of protesters who wore shirts demanding that the government "Stop Killing the Press."<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite news |last=Roughneen |first=Simon |url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2012/08/in-Myanmar-a-delicate-balance-for-new-freedoms-of-speech228.html |title=MediaShift.

However, as explained by one editorial in the exiled press ''[[The Irrawaddy]]'', this new "freedom" has caused some Burmese journalists to simply see the new law as an attempt to create an environment of [[self-censorship]] as journalists "are required to follow 16 guidelines towards protecting the three national causes:
*non-disintegration of the Union,
*non-disintegration of national solidarity,
*perpetuation of sovereignty,
and "journalistic ethics" to ensure their stories are accurate and do not jeopardise national security."<ref name="autogenerated3" />

In July 2014, five journalists were sentenced to 10 years in jail after publishing a report saying the country was planning to build a new chemical weapons plant. Journalists described the imprisonment as a blow to the recently-won news media freedoms that had followed five decades of censorship and persecution.<ref>{{cite news|title=Report on chemical weapons earn Myanmar journalists jail term with hard labour|url=http://www.myanmarnews.net/index.php/sid/223727241/scat/c3891022f175b678/ht/Report-on-chemical-weapons-earn-Myanmar-journalists-jail-term-with-hard-labour|access-date=11 July 2014|publisher=Myanmar News.Net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714194001/http://www.myanmarnews.net/index.php/sid/223727241/scat/c3891022f175b678/ht/Report-on-chemical-weapons-earn-Myanmar-journalists-jail-term-with-hard-labour|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Two Reuters journalists were imprisoned in December 2017 for violating state secrets law when they were covering the mass exodus of the Rohingya Muslim minority.<ref>Eltagouri, Marwa.

Myanmar is one of the poorest nations in Southeast Asia, suffering from decades of stagnation, mismanagement and isolation. The lack of an educated workforce skilled in modern technology hinders Myanmar's economy, although recent reforms and developments carried out by the new government, in collaboration with foreign countries and organisations, aim to make this a thing of the past.<ref>{{cite book | first=Ian | last=Brown | year=2005 | title=A Colonial Economy in Crisis | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-30580-8}}</ref> The informal economy's share in Myanmar is one of the biggest in the world and is closely linked to corruption, smuggling and illegal trade activities.<ref>Stokke, Kristian; Vakulchuk, Roman and Indra Overland (2018) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323018961 Myanmar: A Political Economy Analysis].

Political and economic ideological struggles have affected living standards. Decades of civil war and unrest have contributed to Myanmar's current levels of poverty and lack of economic progress.

=== Economic history ===
[[File:Myingyan Railway Station 2.jpg|thumb|The trains are relatively slow in Myanmar. The railway trip from [[Bagan]] to [[Mandalay]] takes about 7,5 hours (179&nbsp;km).]]

Under British administration, Myanmar was the second-wealthiest country in Southeast Asia. It had been the world's largest exporter of rice. Myanmar also had a wealth of natural and labour resources. British Burma began exporting crude oil in 1853, making it one of the earliest petroleum producers in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://burma.total.com/myanmar-en/oil-and-gas-in-myanmar/oil-and-gas-in-myanmar-900130.html |title=Total in Myanmar : commitment and responsability(sic) |author=Total |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415084151/http://burma.total.com/myanmar-en/oil-and-gas-in-myanmar/oil-and-gas-in-myanmar-900130.html |archive-date=15 April 2015 }}</ref> It produced 75% of the world's teak and had a highly literate population.<ref name="steinberg" /> The wealth was however, mainly concentrated in the hands of Europeans. In the 1930s, agricultural production fell dramatically as international rice prices declined and did not recover for several decades.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/sbbr/editions/file64274.pdf|journal=SOAS Bulletin of Burma Research|volume= 1|issue=1|date=Spring 2003|issn=1479-8484|title=The Burma Development Disaster in Comparative Historical Perspective|author=Booth, Anne}}</ref> Plans to broaden the new prosperity and extend the reach of modern civilisation were halted by the outbreak of the Second World War.

During the Japanese invasion of the area in World War II, the British followed a [[scorched earth]] policy. They destroyed the major government buildings, oil wells and mines for tungsten, tin, lead and silver to keep them from the Japanese. Myanmar was bombed extensively by both sides. After independence, the country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed. The British then granted independence to the colony and handed over their plans to rebuild to the new government. After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister U Nu embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the state was declared the owner of all land. The government also tried to implement a poorly considered Eight-Year plan. By the 1950s, rice exports had fallen by two-thirds and mineral exports by over 96% (as compared to the pre-World War II period). Plans were partly financed by printing money, which led to inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/burma.htm |title=Political and Economic History of Myanmar (Burma) Economics |access-date=8 July 2006|last=Watkins |first=Thayer |publisher=San Jose State University}}</ref>

The 1962 coup d'état was followed by an economic scheme called the [[Burmese Way to Socialism]], a plan to nationalise all industries, with the exception of agriculture. The catastrophic programme turned Myanmar into one of the world's most impoverished countries.<ref name="ruin" /> Myanmar's admittance to [[Least developed countries|least developed country]] status by the UN in 1987 highlighted its economic bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite web |year=2005 |url=https://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/ldc/list.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026045553/http://www.un.org/special-rep/ohrlls/ldc/list.htm|archive-date=26 October 2013|title=List of Least Developed Countries |publisher=UN-OHRLLS }}</ref>

=== Agriculture ===
[[File:Rijstvelden Myanmar 2006.jpg|thumb|Rice is Myanmar's largest agricultural product.]]
{{Further|Agriculture in Myanmar}}

The major agricultural product is [[Rice production in Myanmar|rice]], which covers about 60% of the country's total cultivated land area. Rice accounts for 97% of total food grain production by weight. Through collaboration with the [[International Rice Research Institute]] 52 modern rice varieties were released in the country between 1966 and 1997, helping increase national rice production to 14&nbsp;million tons in 1987 and to 19&nbsp;million tons in 1996. By 1988, modern varieties were planted on half of the country's ricelands, including 98 per cent of the irrigated areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irri.org/media/facts/pdfs/myanmar.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050907011925/http://www.irri.org/media/facts/pdfs/myanmar.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 September 2005 |title=Myanmar and IRRI }}&nbsp;{{small|(21.2&nbsp;KB)}}, Facts About Cooperation, International Rice Research Institute.

=== Drug production ===
Myanmar is also the world's second largest producer of [[opium]], accounting for 25% of entire world production and is a major source of [[illegal drug]]s, including [[amphetamines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/myanmar/myanmar_country_profile_2005.pdf |title=Myanmar Country Profile |access-date=9 July 2006 |date=December 2005 |work=Office on Drugs and Crime | pages=5–6 | publisher=United Nations}}</ref>
Opium bans implemented since 2002 after international pressure have left ex-poppy farmers without sustainable sources of income in the Kokang and Wa regions. They depend on casual labour for income.<ref>[http://www.tni.org/briefing/golden-triangle-rubber-belt Drug Policy Briefing nr.29] of the Transnational Institute.</ref>

=== Natural resources ===
Myanmar produces precious stones such as [[Ruby|rubies]], [[sapphire]]s, [[pearl]]s, and [[jade]]. Rubies are the biggest earner; 90% of the world's rubies come from the country, whose red stones are prized for their purity and hue. Thailand buys the majority of the country's gems. Myanmar's "Valley of Rubies", the mountainous [[Mogok Township|Mogok]] area, {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Mandalay]], is noted for its rare pigeon's blood rubies and blue sapphires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/envnr/gemecology/index.html|title=Gems of Burma and their Environmental Impact |publisher=Uvm.edu |access-date=20 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526104410/http://www.uvm.edu/envnr/gemecology/index.html |archive-date=26 May 2010}}</ref>

Many U.S. and European jewellery companies, including Bulgari, Tiffany and Cartier, refuse to import these stones based on reports of deplorable working conditions in the mines. Human Rights Watch has encouraged a complete ban on the purchase of Burmese gems based on these reports and because nearly all profits go to the ruling junta, as the majority of mining activity in the country is government-run.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2007/11/11/burma-gem-trade-bolsters-military-regime-fuels-atrocities |title=Burma: Gem Trade Bolsters Military Regime, Fuels Atrocities |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=11 November 2007}}</ref> The government of Myanmar controls the gem trade by direct ownership or by joint ventures with private owners of mines.<ref>{{cite news |author=Ferro, Shane |date=19 July 2011 |url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/38144/burmese-gem-emporium-rakes-in-15-billion-despite-human-rights-abuse-concerns/ |title=Burmese Gem Emporium Rakes in $1.5 Billion Despite Human Rights Abuse Concerns |publisher=Blouin ARTINFO |access-date=15 May 2013}}</ref>

Other industries include agricultural goods, textiles, wood products, construction materials, gems, metals, oil and natural gas.

[[Myanmar Engineering Society]] has identified at least 39 locations capable of geothermal power production and some of these hydrothermal reservoirs lie quite close to Yangon which is a significant underutilised resource for electrical production.<ref>{{Citation| last=DuByne| first=David| title= Geothermal Energy in Myanmar Securing Electricity for Eastern Border Development | journal=Myanmar Business Today Magazine |date=November 2015| url=http://www.oilseedcrops.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Geothermal-Energy-in-Myanmar-Securing-Electricity-for-Eastern-Border-Development-David-DuByne.pdf|pages=6–8}}</ref>

Myanmar is ethnically diverse. The government recognises [[List of ethnic groups in Myanmar|135 distinct ethnic groups]]. There are at least 108 different ethnolinguistic groups in Myanmar, consisting mainly of distinct [[Tibeto-Burman]] peoples, but with sizeable populations of [[Tai–Kadai-speaking peoples|Tai–Kadai]], [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]], and Austroasiatic (Mon–Khmer) peoples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=MM |title=Languages of Myanmar |access-date=13 January 2007 |last=Gordon |first=Raymond G., Jr. |year=2005 |work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition |publisher=SIL International}}</ref>

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Myanmar}}

Myanmar is home to four major language families: [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai–Kadai]], [[Austro-Asiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]], and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=MM |title=Languages of Myanmar |access-date=14 July 2006 |last=Gordon |first=Raymond G., Jr. |year=2005 |publisher=SIL International}}</ref> Sino-Tibetan languages are most widely spoken. They include [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Jingpo people|Kachin]], [[Chin people|Chin]], and Chinese (mainly [[Hokkien]]). The primary Tai–Kadai language is [[Shan language|Shan]]. [[Mon language|Mon]], [[Palaung language|Palaung]], and [[Va people|Wa]] are the major [[Austroasiatic]] languages spoken in Myanmar. The two major Indo-European languages are [[Pāli|Pali]], the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism, and English.<ref name="ethno">{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90150 |title=Language Family Trees: Sino-Tibetan |access-date=9 July 2006 |last=Gordon |first=Raymond G., Jr. |year=2005 |work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Fifteenth edition |publisher=SIL International}}</ref> More than a hundred languages are spoken in total. Since many of them are known only within small tribes around the country, they may have been lost (many if not all) after a few generations.

[[Burmese language|Burmese]], the mother tongue of the Bamar and official language of Myanmar, is related to [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] and Chinese.<ref name="ethno" /> It is written in a [[Burmese script|script]] consisting of circular and semi-circular letters, which were adapted from the [[Mon language|Mon script]], which in turn was developed from a southern Indian script in the 5th century. The earliest known inscriptions in the Burmese script date from the 11th century. It is also used to write [[Pāli|Pali]], the sacred language of Theravada Buddhism, as well as several ethnic minority languages, including Shan, several Karen dialects, and Kayah (Karenni), with the addition of specialised characters and [[diacritic]]s for each language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lwinmoe.friendsofburma.org/doc/myanmar_extension.pdf |title=Proposal for encoding characters for Myanmar minority languages in the UCS |access-date=9 July 2006 |date=2 April 2006 |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723083627/http://lwinmoe.friendsofburma.org/doc/myanmar_extension.pdf |archive-date=23 July 2006 }}</ref>

The Burmese language incorporates widespread usage of [[honorific]]s and is age-oriented.<ref name="Myam-ma" /> Burmese society has traditionally stressed the importance of education. In villages, secular schooling often takes place in [[monastery|monasteries]]. Secondary and tertiary education take place at government schools.

According to the [[UNESCO]] Institute of Statistics, Myanmar's official [[literacy rate]] as of 2000 was 90%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/TEMPLATE/html/Exceltables/education/Literacy_Regional_April2006.xls|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625071529/http://www.uis.unesco.org/TEMPLATE/html/Exceltables/education/Literacy_Regional_April2006.xls|archive-date=25 June 2007|title=Adult (15+) Literacy Rates and Illiterate Population by Region and Gender for |access-date=13 July 2006 |date=April 2006 |format=XLS |publisher=UNESCO Institute of Statistics}}</ref> Historically, Myanmar has had high literacy rates. The educational system of Myanmar is operated by the government agency, the [[Ministry of Education (Myanmar)|Ministry of Education]]. The education system is based on the United Kingdom's system after nearly a century of British and Christian presences in Myanmar. Nearly all schools are government-operated, but there has been a recent increase in privately funded English language schools. Schooling is compulsory until the end of elementary school, approximately about 9 years old, while the compulsory schooling age is 15 or 16 at international level.

There are 101 universities, 12 institutes, 9-degree colleges and 24 colleges in Myanmar, a total of 146 higher education institutions.<ref>Chronicle of National Development Comparison Between Period Preceding 1988 and after (up to 31 December 2006).</ref> There are 10 technical training schools, 23 nursing training schools, 1 sport academy and 20 midwifery schools.

{{Main|Culture of Myanmar}}

[[File:Burmese Ramayana dance.jpg|thumb|upright|Burmese [[Kinnara|Kinnayi Kinnaya]] dance]]
A diverse range of indigenous cultures exist in Myanmar, with majority culture primarily Buddhist and [[Bamar people|Bamar]]. Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries, manifested in its language, cuisine, music, dance and theatre. The arts, particularly literature, have historically been influenced by the local form of Theravada Buddhism. Considered the national epic of Myanmar, the ''[[Yama Zatdaw]]'', an adaptation of India's ''[[Ramayana]]'', has been influenced greatly by Thai, Mon, and Indian versions of the play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenlandpages.com/hotspots/rama/rama.htm |title=Ramayana in Myanmar's heart |access-date=13 July 2006 |date=13 September 2003 |publisher=Goldenland Pages |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426233452/http://www.goldenlandpages.com/hotspots/rama/rama.htm |archive-date=26 April 2006 }}</ref> Buddhism is practised along with [[nat (spirit)|nat worship]], which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats.<ref>{{cite book | first=R.

=== Cuisine ===
[[Burmese cuisine]] is characterised by extensive use of fish products such as [[fish sauce]], [[ngapi]] (fermented seafood) and dried prawn. [[Mohinga]] is the traditional breakfast dish and is Myanmar's national dish. Seafood is a common ingredient in coastal cities, while meat and poultry are more commonly used in landlocked cities like Mandalay. Freshwater fish and shrimp have been incorporated into inland cooking as a primary source of protein and are used in a variety of ways, fresh, salted whole or filleted, salted and dried, made into a salty paste, or fermented sour and pressed. Burmese cuisine also includes a variety of salads (''[[a thoke]]''), centred on one major ingredient, ranging from starches like rice, wheat and rice noodles, glass noodles and vermicelli, to potato, ginger, tomato, [[kaffir lime]], long bean, and [[lahpet]] (pickled tea leaves).

=== Art ===
{{Main|Burmese contemporary art|Myanmar architecture}}
Burmese traditional art concepts are popular and respected by the Burmese people and people from abroad. Burmese contemporary art has developed quite rapidly on its own terms. Artists born after the 1980s have had greater chances of art practice outside the country.

One of the first to study western art was [[Ba Nyan]]. Together with [[Ngwe Gaing]] and a handful of other artists, they were the pioneers of western painting style. Later on most young children learned the concepts from them. Some well known contemporary artists are [[Lun Gywe]], Aung Kyaw Htet, [[MPP Yei Myint]], Myint Swe, Min Wai Aung, [[Aung Myint]], [[Kin Maung Yin]], [[Po Po]] and [[Zaw Zaw Aung]].

=== Media and communications ===
{{Main|Media of Myanmar}}
Because of Myanmar's political climate, there are not many media companies in relation to the country's population. Some are privately owned. All programming must meet with the approval of the censorship board. The Burmese government announced on 20 August 2012 that it would stop censoring media before publication. Following the announcement, newspapers and other outlets no longer required approved by state censors; however, journalists in the country can still face consequences for what they write and say.<ref>{{cite news|title=Burma Abolishes Censorship|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2012/08/20/burma-abolishes-censorship.html |work=The Daily Beast|access-date=20 August 2012}}</ref> In April 2013, international media reports were published to relay the enactment of the media liberalisation reforms that we announced in August 2012.

During the strict censorship days, activity at internet cafes was regulated, and one blogger named [[Zarganar]] was sentenced to prison for publishing a video of destruction caused by [[Cyclone Nargis]] in 2008; Zarganar was released in October 2011.

In regards to communications infrastructure, Myanmar is the last ranked Asian country in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI) – an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. With 139 countries reported on, Myanmar ranked number 133 overall in the 2016 NRI ranking.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://reports.weforum.org/global-information-technology-report-2016/networked-readiness-index/?doing_wp_cron=1577930341.6168849468231201171875 | title=NRI Overall Ranking 2016 | publisher=World Economic Forum | access-date=1 January 2020}}</ref>

=== Film ===
{{Main|Cinema of Myanmar}}
Myanmar's first film was a documentary of the funeral of Tun Shein—a leading politician of the 1910s, who campaigned for Burmese independence in London. The first Burmese [[silent film]] ''Myitta Ne Thuya'' (''[[Love and Liquor]]'') in 1920 which proved a major success, despite its poor quality due to a fixed camera position and inadequate film accessories. During the 1920s and 1930s, many Burmese-owned film companies made and produced several films. The first Burmese [[sound film]] was produced in 1932 in [[Bombay]], [[India]] with the title Ngwe Pay Lo Ma Ya (Money Can't Buy It). After World War II, Burmese cinema continued to address political themes. Many of the films produced in the early Cold War era had a strong propaganda element to them.

In the era that followed the political events of 1988, the film industry has been increasingly controlled by the government. Film stars who had been involved in the political activities were banned from appearing in films. The government issues strict rules on censorship and largely determines who produces films, as well as who gets academy awards.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Zaw, Aung |title=Celluloid Disillusions|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/database/2004/vol12.3/cover.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213182520/http://www.irrawaddy.org/database/2004/vol12.3/cover.html|archive-date=13 February 2005|journal=Irrawaddy|volume= 12|issue=3|date=March 2004}}</ref>

Over the years, the movie industry has also shifted to producing many lower-budget [[direct-to-video]] films. Most of the movies produced nowadays are comedies.<ref>Kyi Soe Tun quoted in the Bangkok Post, 11 August 2006</ref> In 2008, only 12 films worthy of being considered for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] were made, although at least 800 VCDs were produced.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120328075748/http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=14937 Through the Director's Lens].
