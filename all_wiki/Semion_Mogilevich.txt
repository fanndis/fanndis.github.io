==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Mogilevich was born in 1946 to a [[History of the Jews in Kyiv|Jewish]] family in [[Kyiv]]'s [[Podil|Podol]] neighborhood.<ref>Block, Alan A.; Weaver, Constance A. (2004) ''All Is Clouded by Desire: Global Banking, Money Laundering, and International Organized Crime''. Greenwood Publishing Group: Westport. {{ISBN|0-275-98330-7}} p. 1.</ref>  

His first significant fortune derived from scamming fellow Russian Jews eager to emigrate to countries including the United States and Israel; Mogilevich made deals to buy their assets, sell them for fair market value, and forward the proceeds. Instead he simply sold the assets and pocketed the proceeds. He served two terms in prison, of 3 and 4 years, for currency-dealing offenses.<ref name="Friedman1998">{{Cite web |last=Friedman |first=Robert I. |authorlink=Robert I. Friedman |date=May 26, 1998 |title=The Most Dangerous Mobster in the World |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-05-26/news/the-most-dangerous-mobster-in-the-world/full/ |access-date=January 22, 2008 |website=[[The Village Voice]]}}</ref>

Beginning in the early 1980s, according to the FBI, Mogilevich was the key money-laundering contact for the [[Solntsevskaya Bratva]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=[[Craig Unger]] |date=July 13, 2017 |title=Trump's Russian Laundromat; How to use Trump Tower and other luxury high-rises to clean dirty money, run an international crime syndicate, and propel a failed real estate developer into the White House. |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate |access-date=November 5, 2017 |website=Newrepublic.com}}</ref>

=== Hungary ===
In early 1991, Mogilevich moved to Hungary and married his Hungarian girlfriend Katalin Papp. He had three children with her, and obtained a Hungarian passport. Living in a fortified villa outside [[Budapest]], he continued to invest in a wide array of Enterprises, including buying a local armament factory, "Army Co-Op," which produced anti-aircraft guns.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Article about activities in Hungary |url=http://www.budapestsun.com/full_story.asp?ArticleID=%7B6493A16274FB46438BE680B4A19AEE86%7D&From=News |url-status=dead |access-date=October 7, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302065332/http://www.budapestsun.com/full_story.asp?ArticleID=%7B6493A16274FB46438BE680B4A19AEE86%7D&From=News |archive-date=March 2, 2012}}</ref>

In 1994, the Mogilevich group obtained control over [[Inkombank]], one of the largest private banks in Russia,<ref>{{Cite web |title=New York court document, 2000 |url=http://russianlaw.org/Morgent1.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701095350/http://russianlaw.org/Morgent1.htm |archive-date=July 1, 2007 |access-date=October 7, 2006}}</ref> in a secret deal with bank chairman [[Vladimir Vinogradov]], getting direct access to the world financial system. the bank collapsed in 1998 under suspicions of [[money laundering]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Moscow Telegraph on investigation of Inkombank management |publisher=Moscow Telegraph |url=http://moscowtelegraph.com/mt050801.htm |access-date=October 7, 2006}}</ref>

=== Czech raid ===
In May 1995, a meeting in [[Prague]] between Mogilevich and [[Sergei Mikhailov (businessman)|Sergei Mikhailov]], head of the Solntsevskaya Bratva, was raided by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] police. The occasion was a birthday party for one of the deputy Solntsevo mafiosi. Two hundred partygoers (including dozens of [[prostitute]]s) in the restaurant "U Holubů", owned by Mogilevich, were detained and 30 expelled from the country.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Journal of the Czech ministry of interior, article about Russian mafias |url=http://www.mvcr.cz/2003/casopisy/pol/0409/rusko_info.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114193653/http://www.mvcr.cz/2003/casopisy/pol/0409/rusko_info.html |archive-date=January 14, 2007 |access-date=October 7, 2006 |language=Czech}}</ref> Police had been tipped off that the Solntsevo group intended to execute Mogilevich at the party<ref>{{Cite web |title=Biography of Mogilevich |url=http://www.volny.cz/vyber_cr/vyber2/pribeh_muze.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041109154007/http://www.volny.cz/vyber_cr/vyber2/pribeh_muze.html |archive-date=November 9, 2004 |access-date=October 7, 2006 |website=[[Lidové Noviny]] |language=Czech}}</ref> over a disputed payment of $5 million. But Mogilevich never showed up and it is believed that a senior figure in the Czech police, working with the [[Russian mafia]], had warned him.<ref>Glenny (2008), ''Op. cit.'', pp 71–72.</ref> Soon, however, the Czech Interior Ministry imposed a 10-year entry ban on Mogilevich, while the Hungarian government declared him ''[[persona non grata]]'' and the British barred his entry into the UK, declaring him "one of the most dangerous men in the world."<ref>Glenny (2008), ''Op. cit.'', pp 75.</ref>

=== Toronto exchange ===
In 1997 and 1998, the presence of Mogilevich, Mikhailov and others associated with the [[Russian Mafia]] behind a public company trading on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] (TSX), YBM Magnex International Inc., was exposed by Canadian journalists. On May 13, 1998, dozens of agents for the FBI and several other U.S. government agencies raided YBM's headquarters in [[Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Newtown, Pennsylvania]]. Shares in the public company, which had been valued at $1 billion on the TSX, became worthless overnight.<ref>{{Cite news |title=BBC Panorama's "The Billion Dollar Don" |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/events/panorama/transcripts/transcript_06_12_99.txt |access-date=September 15, 2007}}</ref>

=== Money laundering and tax evasion ===
Until 1998, Inkombank and [[Bank Menatep]] participated in a US$10 billion [[money laundering]] scheme through the [[Bank of New York]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Overview of the money laundering schemes |url=http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/3516.html##4 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005054117/http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/3516.html |archive-date=October 5, 2006 |access-date=October 7, 2006}}</ref><ref>''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', September 5, 1999: "A Scheme for Ducking Taxes May Be a Key In Russia Money Probe"</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Testimony of Thomas Renyi, CEO of the bank, 1999 |url=http://financialservices.house.gov/banking/92299ren.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929094324/http://financialservices.house.gov/banking/92299ren.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=September 29, 2006 |access-date=October 7, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Senior manager of BoNY indicted, 2001 |url=http://russianlaw.org/bridge3.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814044808/http://russianlaw.org/bridge3.htm |archive-date=August 14, 2007 |access-date=October 7, 2006}}</ref> Mogilevich was also suspected of participation in large-scale tax fraud, where untaxed heating oil was sold as highly taxed car fuel – one of the greatest scandals that broke around 1990–1991.

Estimates are that up to one-third of fuels sold went through this scheme, resulting in massive tax losses for various countries of [[Central Europe]] (Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Overview of fuels scandal |url=http://web.volny.cz/noviny/zdomova/clanek/~volny/IDC/124259/volby-by-nyni-vyhrala-cssd.html |access-date=October 7, 2006 |website=[[Lidové Noviny]] |language=Czech}}</ref> In the Czech Republic the scandal is estimated to have cost the taxpayers around 100 billion CZK (≈US$5 billion)<ref>[http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/40954-podvody-s-lto-zrejme-prisly-stat-na-100-miliard.html Podvody s LTO zřejmě přišly stát na 100 miliard] (Czech)</ref> and involved, besides others, murders and the attempted assassination of a journalist writing about the problem.<ref>[http://www.epravo.cz/top/clanky/nelegalni-obchody-s-lto-prinesly-danove-uniky-i-vrazdy-28351.html?mail Nelegální obchody s LTO přinesly daňové úniky i vraždy] (Czech)</ref>

In 2003, the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] put Mogilevich on the "Wanted List" for participation in the scheme to defraud investors in Canadian company YBM Magnex International Inc. Frustrated by their previous unsuccessful efforts to charge him for [[arms trafficking]] and [[prostitution]], they had now settled on the large-scale fraud charges as their best hope of running him to ground. He was, however, considered to be the most powerful Russian mobster alive.<ref name="alive">Glenny (2008), ''Op. cit.'', pg 77.</ref> In a 2006 interview, former Clinton administration anti-organized-crime czar Jon Winer said: "I can tell you that Semion Mogilevich is as serious an organized criminal as I have ever encountered and I am confident that he is responsible for [[contract killing]]s."<ref name="alive" />

Mogilevich was arrested in Moscow on January 24, 2008, for suspected [[tax evasion]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Guy Faulconbridge |date=January 25, 2008 |title=Russia detains crime boss wanted by FBI |publisher=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSL2537376820080125 |access-date=March 29, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Login |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3253243.ece |website=timesonline.co.uk}}</ref> His bail was placed, and he was released on July 24, 2009. On his release, the Russian interior ministry stated that he was released because the charges against him "are not of a particularly grave nature".<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 27, 2009 |title=Suspects in Arbat Prestige case released with travel ban |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090727/155636705.html |website=rian.ru}}</ref><ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE56Q0JT20090727 Russia frees crime boss wanted by U.S.], [[Reuters]] (July 27, 2009)</ref>

=== FBI Ten Most Wanted list ===
On October 22, 2009, he was named by the FBI as the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 2000s|494th fugitive to be placed]] on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted list]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=FBI — New Top Ten - Global Con Artist |url=https://www.fbi.gov/page2/oct09/mogilevich_102109.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008000445/http://www.fbi.gov/page2/oct09/mogilevich_102109.html |archive-date=October 8, 2010 |website=FBI}}</ref> In December 2015, he was removed from the list. The FBI indicated he no longer met list criteria, for reasons relating to living in a country with which the United States does not maintain an [[Extradition#Extradition treaties or agreements|extradition treaty]].<ref>Babay, Emily (December 17, 2015) [http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20151218_Philly_fugitive_bumped_off_FBI__Most_Wanted__list.html Philly fugitive bumped off FBI 'Most Wanted' list] ''Philadelphia Inquirer''. Retrieved January 16, 2016.</ref>

According to FBI reports, Mogilevich had alliances with the [[Camorra]], in particular with Salvatore DeFalco, a lower-echelon member of the [[Giuliano clan]]. Mogilevich and DeFalco would have held meetings in Prague in 1993.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Federal Bureau of Investigation|url=http://archive.org/details/SEMIONMOGILEVICH1996|title=SEMION MOGILEVICH ORGANIZATION EURASIAN ORGANIZED CRIME (1996)|date=1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=C. Williams|first=Robert|title=Useful Assets|publisher=Dorrance Publishing Co. Inc.|year=January 30, 2019|isbn=|location=|pages=25}}</ref>

In spite of the warrants issued against him, he still lives freely in Moscow, according to the FBI.<ref>{{Cite web |title=FBI — SEMION MOGILEVICH |url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/semion-mogilevich/view |website=FBI}}</ref> As to Mogilevich himself, government law enforcement agencies from throughout the world had by then been trying to prosecute him for over 10 years. But he had, in the words of one journalist, "a knack for never being in the wrong place at the wrong time".<ref>Glenny (2008), ''Op. cit.'', pg 76.</ref>

Both Mogilevich and his associate Mikhailov ceased to travel to the West in the late 1990s.<ref name="alive" />
