==History==
===Old Miami===
The foundations for Miami University were first laid by [[s:United States Statutes at Large/Volume 1/2nd Congress/1st Session/chapter 30|an Act of Congress]] signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George Washington]], stating an academy should be Northwest of the [[Ohio River]] in the [[Miami Valley]].<ref name="OverviewHist">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamioh.edu/documents_and_policies/bulletin06/gen_info/index.html|title=Miami University: Documents and Policies: General Bulletin|publisher=Miami University|accessdate=2010-02-28}}</ref> The land was within the [[Symmes Purchase]]; Judge [[John Cleves Symmes]], the land's owner, purchased it from the government with the stipulation that he set aside land for an academy.<ref name="MiamiYears">{{cite book |title=The Miami Years|last=Havighurst|first=Walter|author-link=Walter Havighurst|year=1984|publisher=G.P. Putnam and Sons|location=New York|url=http://www.lib.miamioh.edu/my/ |accessdate=2010-02-28}}</ref> Congress granted one township to be in the District of Cincinnati to the [[Ohio General Assembly]] for the purposes of building a college, two days after [[Ohio]] was granted [[Federated state|statehood]] in 1803; if no suitable location could be provided in the Symmes Purchase, Congress pledged to give federal lands to the legislature after a five-year period. The Ohio Legislature appointed three surveyors in August of the same year to search for a suitable township, and they selected a township off of Four Mile Creek.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> The Legislature passed "An Act to Establish the Miami University" on February 2, 1809, and the state created a board of trustees; this is cited as the founding of Miami University.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> The township originally granted to the university was known as the "[[College Township]]," and was renamed [[Oxford, Ohio]], in 1810.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The University temporarily halted construction due to the [[War of 1812]].<ref name="MiamiYears" /> [[Cincinnati]] tried—and failed—to move Miami to the city in 1822 and to divert its income to a Cincinnati college.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> Miami created a [[grammar school]] in 1818 to teach frontier youth, but it was disbanded after five years.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> [[Robert Hamilton Bishop]], a Presbyterian minister and professor of history, was appointed to be the first President of Miami University in 1824. The first day of classes at Miami was on November 1, 1824.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> At its opening, there were 20 students and two faculty members in addition to Bishop.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> The curriculum included [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Algebra]], [[Geography]], and [[Roman history]]; the University offered only a [[Bachelor of Arts]]. An "English Scientific Department" was started in 1825, which studied modern languages, [[applied mathematics]], and [[political economy]] as training for more practical professions. It offered a certificate upon completion of coursework, not a diploma.<ref name="MiamiYears" />

Miami students purchased a [[printing press]], and in 1827 published their first periodical, ''The Literary Focus''. It promptly failed, but it laid the foundation for the weekly ''Literary Register''. The ''[[The Miami Student|Miami Student]]'', founded in 1867, traces its foundation back to the ''Literary Register'' and claims to be the oldest college newspaper in the United States.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> A theological department and a farmer's college were formed in 1829; the farmer's college was not an [[agricultural school]], but a three-year education program for farm boys. [[William Holmes McGuffey]] joined the faculty in 1826, and began his work on the ''[[McGuffey Readers]]'' while in Oxford.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> By 1834 the faculty had grown to seven professors and enrollment was at 234 students.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> Eleven students were expelled in 1835, including one for firing a pistol at another student. McGuffey resigned and became the President of the [[Cincinnati College]], where he urged parents not to send their children to Miami.<ref name="MiamiYears" />

[[Image:Miamiu.jpg|left|thumb|[[Alumni Hall (Miami University)|Alumni Hall]] in winter|alt=]] [[Image:Miami Bell Tower.JPG|thumb|The "Beta Bells" of Miami University were built with funds donated by the [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity on its Centennial in 1939.|alt=]]
[[Alpha Delta Phi]] opened its chapter at Miami in 1833, making it the first [[fraternity]] chapter West of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. In 1839, [[Beta Theta Pi]] was created; it was the first fraternity formed at Miami.<ref name="MiamiYears" />

In 1839 Old Miami reached its enrollment peak, with 250 students from 13 states; only [[Harvard]], [[Yale]], and [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] were larger.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> President Bishop resigned in 1840 due to escalating problems in the University, although he remained as a professor through 1844. He was replaced as President by [[George Junkin]], former President of [[Lafayette College]]; Junkin resigned in 1844, having proved to be unpopular with students.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> By 1847, enrollment had fallen to 137 students.

Students in 1848 participated in the "Snowball Rebellion". Defying the faculty's stance against fraternities, students packed Old Main, one of Miami's main classrooms and administrative buildings, with snow and reinforced the snow with chairs, benches and desks from the classroom.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> Those who had participated in the rebellion were expelled from the school and Miami's student population was more than halved. By 1873, enrollment fell further to 87 students. The board of trustees closed the school in 1873, and leased the campus for a grammar school.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> The period before its closing is referred to as "Old Miami."<ref name="MiamiYears" />[[File:Satirical map of Miami University campus n.d.

===New Miami===
The university reopened in 1885, having paid all of its debts and repaired many of its buildings; there were 40 students in its first year. Enrollment remained under 100 students throughout the 1800s. Miami focused on aspects outside of the classics, including [[botany]], [[physics]], and [[geology]] departments.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> In 1888, Miami began inter-collegiate football play in a game against the University of Cincinnati.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> By the early 1900s, the state of Ohio pledged regular financial support for Miami University. Enrollment reached 207 students in 1902. The Ohio General Assembly passed the Sesse Bill in 1902, which mandated [[coeducation]] for all Ohio public schools. Miami lacked the rooms to fit all of the students expected the next year, and Miami made an arrangement with [[Oxford Female Institute|Oxford College]], a women's college in the town, to rent rooms. Miami's first [[African-American]] student, Nelly Craig, graduated in 1905.<ref name="OverviewHist" /> Hepburn Hall, built in 1905, was the first women's dorm at the college. By 1907, the enrollment at the University passed 700 students and women made up about a third of the student body.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> [[Andrew Carnegie]] pledged $40,000 to help build a new [[Alumni Hall (Miami University)|library]] for the University.<ref name="MiamiYears" />

Enrollment in 1923 was at 1,500 students. The [[Oxford Female Institute|Oxford College for Women]] merged with Miami University in 1928.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> By the early 1930s, enrollment had reached 2,200 students. The conservative environment found on campus called for little change during the problems of the [[Great Depression]], and only about 10 percent of students in the 1930s were on government subsidies.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> During [[World War II]], Miami changed its curriculum to include "war emergency courses" and a Navy Training School took up residence on campus. During wartime in 1943, the population of the University became majority women.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> Due to the [[G.I. Bill of Rights|G.I. Bill]], tuition for veterans decreased; the enrollment at Miami jumped from 2,200 to 4,100 students. Temporary lodges were constructed to accommodate the number of students. By 1952, the student body had grown to 5,000.<ref name="MiamiYears" />

[[File:Miami University, Ohio c. 1909.jpg|center|800px|thumb|Miami University in 1909]]

In 1954, Miami created a common curriculum for all students to complete to have a base for their other subjects. By 1964, enrollment reached nearly 15,000.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> To accommodate the growing number of students, Miami University started a regional branch of the University at [[Miami University Middletown|Middletown, Ohio]], in 1966 and [[Miami University Hamilton|Hamilton, Ohio]], in 1968.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> Miami founded a Luxembourg branch, today called the [[Miami University Dolibois European Center]], in 1968; students live with Luxembourgian families, and study under Miami professors.<ref name="MiamiYears" /> Miami experimented with a [[Academic term|trimester]] plan in 1965, but it ultimately failed and the university reverted to a quarter system. In 1974, The [[Western College for Women]] in Oxford, was sold to Miami; and President Shriver oversaw the creation of the well-respected and innovative Interdisciplinary Studies Program known as the [[Western College Program]].<ref name="MiamiYears" /> The program was merged into the College of Arts & Science in 2007.<ref name="closingfaq">{{cite web|url=http://www.cas.miamioh.edu/western/faq.html|title=FAQ :: Western Program|publisher=Miami University|accessdate=2010-02-28}}</ref> The newest regional campus, the [[Miami University Voice of America Learning Center]] opened in 2009.

==Campuses==
===Oxford===
[[File:MacCracken Winter.jpeg|alt=|thumb|[[MacCracken Hall]] is one of several iconic campus buildings.]]
Miami University's main campus is in [[Oxford, Ohio]]; the city is in the [[Miami Valley]] in southwestern Ohio. Development of the campus began in 1818 with a multipurpose building called Franklin Hall; [[Elliott and Stoddard Halls|Elliott Hall]], built in 1825, is Miami's oldest residence hall.<ref name="MiamiYears" /><ref name="walkingtour" /> Miami is renowned for its campus beauty, having been called "The most beautiful campus that ever there was" by Pulitzer Prize-winning poet [[Robert Frost]], a friend of then Miami artist-in-residence [[Percy MacKaye]], a poet. Miami has added campus buildings, such as the [[Farmer School of Business Building (Miami University)|Farmer School of Business Building]], in the style characteristic of [[Georgian Revival]] architecture, with all buildings built three stories or less, or "to human scale".

In addition to these, the Glee Club will often perform at Miami University events, local churches, and high schools in the greater Ohio area.

The Glee Club has also performed with major symphony orchestras at a regional and national level; most frequently with the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]]. Throughout its history, the Glee Club has worked with renowned composers, conductors and singers such as [[Morten Lauridsen]], [[Martina Arroyo]], [[Max Rudolf (conductor)|Max Rudolf]], [[Thomas Schippers]], [[Paul Salamunovich]] and more recently [[A.

Within its existing residential life programs, Miami offers students the option of choosing from 35 theme-based living learning communities (LLCs). All first-year residential halls on campus participate in the LLC program to create bonds among students based on their field of study and shared interests.<ref name="LLCoverview">{{cite web|url=http://miamioh.edu/student-life/residence-life/living-learning-communities/index.html|title=LLC Overview|publisher=Miami University|accessdate=2015-06-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://miamioh.edu/student-life/residence-life/residential-communities/index.html|title=About Living Learning Communities - Miami University|accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref> In an LLC, students are co-enrolled into one or more classes, which further support student's transition into the university's liberal arts education. Smaller groups of students may also create their second year LLC to further their learning together.

Each residence hall has various [[resident assistant]]s (RAs) who are full-time enrolled students that assist the Office of Residence Life to promote community engagement, enforce hall and university policies, submit residence hall reports, and promote academic success. Residence halls also have representatives that participate collectively in the [[Residence Hall Association]] and the [[student senate]].<ref name="ASGabout">{{cite web|url=http://www.muasg.com/about-asg|title=About ASG|publisher=Miami University Associated Student Government|accessdate=2010-02-26}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Sorority members of Miami's [[Alpha Xi Delta]] chapter and their dates at a formal held at the [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center]] urinated throughout the venue, swore at staff, and attempted to steal drinks from the bar; one other incident involving the [[Pi Beta Phi]] chapter at Miami involved similar behavior.<ref name="alphaxi">{{cite web|url=http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20100518/NEWS01/305180056/|title=Miami sorority suspended for two years|author=McLaughlin, Sheila|date=2010-05-18|website=cincinnati.com|accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref><ref name="sorority3">{{cite web|url=http://news.cincinnati.com/article/20100601/NEWS010701/6020369/Third-Miami-sorority-trouble-party|title=Third Miami sorority in trouble for party|author=McLaughlin, Sheila|date=2010-06-01|website=cincinnati.com|accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> Former University President David Hodge called the behavior "deeply troubling" and "embarrassing", and vowed "we are determined to live up to our values" in response to the incidents.<ref name="nydailynews">{{cite news|url=http://www.units.miamioh.edu/saf/GRA/CliffAlexander.htm|title=Sorority at Miami University of Ohio accused of drunken debauchery at Underground Railroad museum|author=Miller, Tracy|date=2010-05-14|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref>

More recently, Miami's Greek system has come under fire for numerous hazing and alcohol violations. Multiple Greek organizations have been suspended in recent years, including [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Phi Kappa Tau]] (Alpha chapter), [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Sigma Nu]], and [[Zeta Beta Tau]]. In late 2015 three fraternities (Sigma Nu, Phi Kappa Psi and Kappa Sigma) were evicted from Miami University. Among the violations was encouraging pledges to drink 100 beers and pose for inappropriate social media pictures. In other instances, pledges were subjected to hours-long, early-morning workouts, and forbidden to shower or shave.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/3-miami-university-fraternities-suspended-amid-haz/nnb5c/|title=Miami: Fraternity hazed with 100 beers, no showers|website=www.journal-news.com|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref> In 2019, Miami's [[Delta Tau Delta]] chapter was suspended until 2034 due to hazing and violations of Miami's student conduct code, and its national charter was revoked.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Londberg|first=Sarah Brookbank and Max|title=18 indicted after Miami University dismissed Delta Tau Delta fraternity for hazing|url=https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/crime/crime-and-courts/2019/10/03/miami-university-delta-tau-delta-hazing-charges/3849829002/|access-date=2020-09-24|website=The Enquirer|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Athletics ==
{{Main|Miami RedHawks}}

Miami's [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] sports teams are called the [[Miami RedHawks|RedHawks]]; the program offers 18 [[varsity sports]] for men and women. They compete in the [[Mid-American Conference]] (MAC) in all varsity sports except ice hockey, which competes in the [[National Collegiate Hockey Conference]].

Miami's athletic teams were called The Miami Boys, The Big Reds, The Reds, or The Red and Whites until 1928 when Miami Publicity Director R.J. McGinnis coined the nickname "Redskins". The athletic teams were known as the Redskins up through 1997 when the [[Oklahoma]]-based [[Miami tribe]] withdrew its support for the nickname; the board of trustees voted to change the nickname to the RedHawks.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

The current athletic director is [[David Sayler]], who was hired to the position in December 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muredhawks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=26100&ATCLID=205865563|title=David Sayler: Director of Athletics Profile|publisher=Miami University|accessdate=2013-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805182513/http://www.muredhawks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=26100&ATCLID=205865563|archive-date=2013-08-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Football===

[[Image:Yager Stadium (23656930573).jpg|thumb|A football game at [[Yager Stadium (Miami University)|Yager Stadium]] |alt=]]

Miami is nicknamed the "[[Cradle of Coaches]]" for the coaches that have trained through its [[American football|football]] program, including [[College Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] inductees [[Paul Brown]], [[Carmen Cozza]], [[Weeb Ewbank]], [[Ara Parseghian]], [[Earl Blaik]], [[Woody Hayes]], [[Bo Schembechler]], and [[Jim Tressel]], to name some from a selection of over 80. [[Ben Roethlisberger]], a quarterback from Miami, has gone on to be a two-time [[Super Bowl]] winning quarterback for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. [[John Harbaugh]], a defensive back from Miami, coached the [[Baltimore Ravens]] to a victory in [[Super Bowl XLVII]].

Miami's football team plays in [[Yager Stadium (Miami University)|Yager Stadium]], a 24,286-seat football stadium on campus; they formerly played in the now demolished [[Miami Field]]. The current head coach is [[Chuck Martin (American football)|Chuck Martin]], who was named head coach December 3, 2013. The RedHawks compete each year against the [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati Bearcats]] for the [[Victory Bell (Miami–Cincinnati)|Victory Bell]], a tradition that dates back to 1888. The [[Battle of the Bricks]] is also played annually against the [[Ohio Bobcats football|Ohio Bobcats]]. The RedHawks are 684–455–44 overall and 7–5 in bowl games as of the 2019 season.

===Basketball===
{{Main|Miami RedHawks men's basketball}}

The Miami men's [[basketball]] team has appeared in 17 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA basketball championship tournaments]], reaching the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Regional semifinals and finals|Sweet Sixteen]] four times, most recently in [[1999 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1999]]. Notable former student-athletes have included [[Randy Ayers]], [[Ron Harper]], [[Wally Szczerbiak]], and [[Wayne Embry]].

The team competes in [[Millett Hall]] and is coached by [[Jack Owens (basketball)|Jack Owens]].

===Men's ice hockey===

Since the [[Mid-American Conference]] does not include Division I men's ice hockey, Miami competed in the [[Central Collegiate Hockey Association]] (CCHA) through the 2012-2013 season. It was one of three schools from the MAC in the CCHA along with [[Bowling Green State University]] and [[Western Michigan University]]. However, starting with the 2013-2014 season, Miami and Western Michigan began competing in the [[National Collegiate Hockey Conference]].

The men's ice hockey team plays at the [[Goggin Ice Center]]. The center has two rinks: a practice rink, and [[Steve Cady Arena]], which is used by the hockey team. The arena has a [[seating capacity]] of 3,200, and replaced the [[Goggin Ice Arena]] in 2006.

===Wrestling===
{{More citations needed section|date=December 2019}}
At one time Miami had a very competitive wrestling program. They won eight Mid-American Conference titles (1961, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1984, 1991 and 1992) and produced 51 NCAA qualifiers who earned 81 qualifications to the NCAA Division I tournament. Seven of their wrestlers earned All American status with HWT Mike Holcomb placing twice (5th in 1982, 3rd in 1984).

In 1999, Miami eliminated the wrestling program, along with men's golf and tennis, to better comply with [[Title IX]] regulations (female students made up 54% of campus but only 29% of athletes).<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-6th-circuit/1161180.html|title=MIAMI UNIVERSITY WRESTLING CLUB, ET AL. v.

The students appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]], where two judges affirmed the district court's ruling, stating, "We find that the plaintiffs wholly failed to state either an equal protection claim or a claim under Title IX, and that the district court's denial of the motion for class certification was within the court's sound discretion."<ref name=":1" />
