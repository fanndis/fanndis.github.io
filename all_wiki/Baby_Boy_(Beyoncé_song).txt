"'''Baby Boy'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] featuring Jamaican [[dancehall]] singer [[Sean Paul]] from Beyoncé's debut solo studio album ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'' (2003). Both artists co-wrote the song with [[Scott Storch]], Robert Waller and [[Jay-Z|Shawn "Jay-Z" Carter]]; the former also co-produced the song. Containing a lyrical interpolation of "No Fear" by [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group [[Originoo Gunn Clappaz|O.G.C]], "Baby Boy" is an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[dancehall]] song with Caribbean and Asian influences; its lyrics detail a woman's fantasies.

[[Columbia Records]] and [[Music World Entertainment]] released "Baby Boy" as the second single from ''Dangerously in Love'' on August 3, 2003. "Baby Boy" topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for nine consecutive weeks and was Beyoncé's longest-running number-one single until 2007, when it was surpassed by "[[Irreplaceable]]". It reached the top ten in many countries and was certified platinum by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). It also reached the top 10 in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
 
The song's music video was directed by [[Jake Nava]] and mostly shows Beyoncé dancing in various locations. "Baby Boy" has remained a staple of Beyoncé's concert [[set list]]s. The [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 2004. In 2005, American singer-songwriter Jennifer Armour filed a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit claiming that the song had used the primary musical [[hook (music)|hook]] from her song "Got a Little Bit of Love for You". The suit was later dismissed.

==Background and development==
[[File:SeanPaul2005.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sean Paul]] (''pictured'') contributed vocals to "Baby Boy".]]
In 2002, Beyoncé went to Miami, Florida, in the United States, to work with American record producer [[Scott Storch]] for her debut solo studio album ''[[Dangerously in Love]]''.<ref name="liner"/> She and Storch wrote "Baby Boy", with contributions from American songwriter Robert Waller and Beyoncé's now-husband, [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artist [[Jay-Z]].<ref name="liner">{{cite AV media notes |title=[[Dangerously in Love]] |others=Beyoncé Knowles |year=2003 |first=Beyoncé |last=Knowles |authorlink=Beyoncé Knowles |type=Compact Disc Liner Notes|publisher=[[Columbia Records]] |id=5044750 959529 |location= |page=2 }}</ref> The song also contains a lyrical interpolation of "No Fear" by hip hop group [[Originoo Gunn Clappaz|O.G.C.]] used towards the ending of the song: "We steppin' in hotter this year".<ref name="Docu">{{Cite video |title=Dangerously in Love |publisher=Columbia Records |date=2003}}</ref>

"Baby Boy" is considered to be a sequel to [[Jay-Z]]'s song "[['03 Bonnie & Clyde]]" (2002) featuring Beyoncé.<ref name="Gil"/> The lyrics detail a woman's fantasies, and in keeping with the album's overall theme, Beyoncé's deemed them as personal to her.<ref name="Thread"/> Paul remarked: "She's telling me about her fantasies and picturing me and her going here and there, all over the world&nbsp;... I'm answering back, like, 'I'm wit it'."<ref name="Gil"/> The lyrics are constructed in the toast–chorus–verse form; Sean Paul performs the toasting while Beyoncé sings all other [[Song structure (popular music)|verses]] and [[refrain|choruses]].

With regard to the musical hook, the expert witness stated in his report: "When the aural comparisons of the two songs are presented in the key of [[C minor]] (for easy comparison) and presented back-to-back, in A–B–A–B fashion, even the least musically inclined listener should immediately determine that the two songs are strikingly similar; I daresay that many listeners may even perceive them as being the same song! And again, transposing a song for this purpose does not alter any fundamental qualities or characteristics of the song but merely assists the ability of those unfamiliar with the technicalities of music in making a comparison." The district court judge nonetheless ruled that she, herself, couldn't hear the similarities between the two songs and dismissed the case, denying the motion for the songs or case to be heard by a jury.<ref name="Case"/> On appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] affirmed the district court's ruling, but ruled with different reasoning. It held that there was no infringement based on Beyoncé's claim that Armour's demo tape was received shortly after the writing of Beyoncé's song had been substantially completed.

Scenes featuring Beyoncé and Paul are shown separately. The video begins with Paul sitting on a throne while [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]; Beyoncé is leaning against a wall and dancing. In the following scene, Beyoncé is seen on a bed. Paul is shown with several women who are lying on the floor caressing each other. Beyoncé walks towards the beach; she spots a man, and the two touch and flirt. As the second verse of the begins, Beyoncé is at a party. At the party Beyoncé decides to dance with the same man that she interacted with earlier. Then, water floods the floor of the party as she sings "the dance floor becomes the sea". As the second chorus of the song begins, the video is cut with scenes of Beyoncé and four back-up dancers dancing on a platform in the sand on the beach. The original track is interrupted towards the end with an [[Arabic music|Arabic]] instrumental, designed for the music video. This section showcases Beyoncé vigorously dancing on the sand.
