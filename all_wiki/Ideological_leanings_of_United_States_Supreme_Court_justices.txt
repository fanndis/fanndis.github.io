{{SCOTUS series}}
The [[United States]] [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] is the highest [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal court of the United States]]. Established pursuant to [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]] in 1789, it has ultimate (and largely [[Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States|discretionary]]) [[appellate jurisdiction]] over all federal courts and [[State court (United States)|state court]] cases involving issues of [[U.S. federal law|federal law]] plus [[original jurisdiction]] over a small range of cases. In the [[Law of the United States|legal system of the United States]], the Supreme Court is generally the final interpreter of federal law including the [[United States Constitution]], but it may act only within the context of a case in which it has jurisdiction. The Court may decide cases having political overtones but does not have power to decide [[Justiciability|nonjusticiable]] [[political question]]s, and [[Marshal of the United States Supreme Court|its enforcement arm]] is in the executive rather than judicial branch of government.

As established by the [[Judiciary Act of 1869]], the Court normally consists of the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] and eight [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|associate justices]] who are nominated by the [[President of the United States|president]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The justices base their decisions on their interpretation of both legal doctrine and the [[precedent]]ial application of laws in the past. In most cases, interpreting the law is relatively clear-cut and the justices decide unanimously. However, in more complicated or controversial cases, the Court is often divided.

In modern discourse, the justices of the Court are often categorized as having [[Conservatism in the United States#Courts|conservative]], [[moderate]], or [[Liberalism in the United States#Courts|liberal]] [[Philosophy of law|philosophies of law]] and of [[judicial interpretation]]. It has long been commonly assumed that a justice's votes reflect his or her [[Jurisprudence|judicial decision-making philosophy]] as well as their [[Ideology#Political ideologies|ideological leanings]], [[Attitude (psychology)|personal attitudes]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[Political philosophy|political philosophies]], or policy preferences. A growing body of academic research has confirmed this understanding, as scholars have found that the justices largely vote in consonance with their perceived values.<ref name=SegalSpaeth2002>{{cite book| title=The Supreme Court and the Attitudinal Model Revisited| first1=Jeffrey A.| last1=Segal| first2=Harold J.| last2=Spaeth| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge| year=2002| isbn=978-0521783514}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| title=Is the Roberts Court Especially Activist?

== Ideological leanings over time ==
Researchers have carefully analyzed the judicial rulings of the Supreme Court—the votes and written opinions of the justices—as well as their upbringing, their political party affiliation, their speeches, editorials written about them at the time of their Senate confirmation, and the political climate in which they are appointed, confirmed, and work.<ref name=ZornCaldeira2008>Zorn and Caldeira provide a good overview of these methods and their limitations: {{cite document

}} Epstein, Walker, and Dixon found they could explain and predict rulings in criminal justice cases (in the study period 1946–1986) using a simple model with four inputs: the political party affiliation of the majority of justices, the political party affiliation of the current president (representing the current political climate), the Supreme Court rulings in criminal justice cases in the previous year, and the percent of criminal cases the Court decides to hear in the current year (how much interest they take in the issue). In this analysis, the political party affiliation of the majority of justices provided about one-fourth of the predictive power.

}} Pinello conducted a meta-analysis of 84 studies of American courts covering 222,789 cases and found that political party affiliation was a dependable indicator of rulings: Democratic judges voted in favor of liberal solutions more often than Republican judges did, especially in federal courts (the U.S. Supreme Court, [[United States courts of appeals|U.S. Courts of Appeal]], and [[United States district court|U.S. District Courts]]).</ref>

Using statistical analysis of Supreme Court votes, scholars found that an inferred value representing a Justice's ideological preference on a simple conservative–liberal scale is sufficient to predict a large number of that justice's votes.<ref>

Analyzing terms with an unchanging membership ("natural courts") and a complete bench of nine members (3,363 cases), they found that a one-dimensional scale provided a satisfactory explanation of votes and that the degree of unidimensionality generally rose over the years. "On average, over the 15 courts, the mean r<sup>2</sup> values are 0.86 for a one dimensional metric MDS solution, and 0.97 for a two dimensional metric MDS solution."

== Ideological shifts since 1937 ==
In the early 1930s (earlier than the data on the Martin–Quinn graph), the [[Four Horsemen (Supreme Court)|"Four Horsemen"]] (Justices [[James Clark McReynolds|James McReynolds]], [[Pierce Butler (justice)|Pierce Butler]], [[George Sutherland]], and [[Willis Van Devanter]]) mostly opposed the New Deal agenda proposed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. The liberal [[The Three Musketeers (Supreme Court)|"Three Musketeers"]] (Justices [[Harlan F. Stone|Harlan Stone]], [[Benjamin N. Cardozo|Benjamin Cardozo]], and [[Louis Brandeis]]) generally supported the New Deal. Two justices (Chief Justice [[Charles Evans Hughes]] and Justice [[Owen Roberts]]) normally cast the swing votes.

As the Martin–Quinn graph shows, by the 1939 term, Roosevelt had moved the Court to a more liberal position by appointing four new justices including strong liberals [[Hugo Black]], [[William O. Douglas]], and [[Frank Murphy]]. However, led by the increasingly conservative Chief Justices [[Harlan F. Stone|Harlan Stone]] and [[Fred M. Vinson|Fred Vinson]], the Court shifted in a more conservative direction through the early 1950s.

President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] appointed [[Earl Warren]] to be Chief Justice in 1953, and both graphs indicate that the Court then turned in a more liberal direction as Warren grew substantially more liberal and especially when he was joined by strong liberal justices [[William J. Brennan Jr.|William Brennan]], [[Arthur Goldberg]], [[Abe Fortas]], and [[Thurgood Marshall]] (though Justices Black and [[Felix Frankfurter]] became more conservative over time). In the 1970s, the Court shifted in a more conservative direction when President [[Richard Nixon]] appointed Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger|Warren Burger]] and strong conservative Justices [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.|Lewis Powell]], [[William Rehnquist]], and [[Harry Blackmun]], and more so when President [[Ronald Reagan]] elevated Rehnquist to Chief Justice (though Blackmun became more liberal over time). The Court shifted to an even more conservative orientation when it was joined by strong conservative Justices [[Antonin Scalia]] (appointed by President [[Ronald Reagan]]), [[Clarence Thomas]] (appointed by President [[George H.W. Bush]]), and [[Samuel Alito]] and Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]] (both whom were appointed by President [[George W. Bush]]). During this time, Justice [[David Souter]] became more liberal.<ref

The path of Justice [[Harry Blackmun]] illustrates the ideological drift shown by many justices.<ref name=Ruger2005 /> Blackmun (purple line) had a conservative score (Quinn–Martin = 1.462; Bailey = 0.43) in the 1969–70 term, his first on the bench, but had shifted to a liberal score (Quinn–Martin = −1.931; Bailey = −0.81) by the 1993–94 term, his last. The median justice (shown with a yellow background line) was [[Byron White]] for most of the time from 1962 to 1993, [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Sandra Day O’Connor]] from 1994 to 2005, and [[Anthony Kennedy]] from 2006 to 2018.

As can be seen in these graphs, since the 1938 term, every Chief Justice (black lines), except Earl Warren, has had a more conservative ideological lean than the median justice on the Court.

The term ''liberal'' in the Supreme Court Database represents the voting direction of the justices across the various issue areas. It is most appropriate in the areas of criminal procedure, civil rights, and First Amendment cases, where it signifies pro-defendant votes in criminal procedure cases, pro-women or -minorities in civil rights cases, and pro-individual against the government in First Amendment cases. In takings clause cases, however, a pro-government/anti-owner vote is considered liberal. The use of the term is probably less appropriate in union cases, where it represents pro-union votes against both individuals and the government, and in economic cases, where it represents pro-government votes against challenges to federal regulatory authority and pro-competition, anti-business, pro-liability, pro-injured person, and pro-bankruptcy decisions. In federalism and federal taxation cases, the term indicates pro-national government positions.

* # (Justice number) – order that Supreme Court Justice was appointed
* Justice – Justice's name
* Year confirmed – year confirmed to the Supreme Court
* Position – Chief Justice or Associate Justice
* Criminal procedure – a higher number means pro-defendant votes in cases involving the rights of persons accused of crime, except for the due process rights of prisoners.
* Civil rights – a higher number means more votes permitting intervention on First Amendment freedom cases which pertain to classifications based on race (including Native Americans), age, indigence, voting, residence, military, or handicapped status, sex, or alienage.
* First Amendment – a higher number reflects votes that advocate individual freedoms with regard to speech.
* Union – a higher number means pro-union votes in cases involving labor activity.
* Economic – a higher number means more votes against commercial business activity, plus litigation involving injured persons or things, employee actions concerning employers, zoning regulations, and governmental regulation of corruption other than that involving campaign spending.
* Federalism – a higher number means votes for a larger, more empowered government in conflicts between the federal and state governments, excluding those between state and federal courts, and those involving the priority of federal fiscal claims.
* Federal taxes – a higher number means more votes widening the government's ability to define and enforce tax concepts and policies in cases involving the Internal Revenue Code and related statues.
