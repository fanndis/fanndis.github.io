'''Charles William Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck''' (8 November 1817 – 17 August 1865) was a [[clergy]]man of the [[Church of England]], holding livings in [[Bedfordshire]], and a great-grandfather of Queen [[Elizabeth II]].

He used his names in the order William Charles Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck, and his usual signature was "W. C. C. Bentinck".

==Life and career==
Born at Kensington, Bentinck was the elder son of Lieutenant Colonel [[Lord Charles Bentinck]]<ref>[http://worldroots.com/brigitte/royal/bio/charlescavendishbio.html Charles Cavendish]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513113719/http://worldroots.com/brigitte/royal/bio/charlescavendishbio.html |date=May 13, 2006 }}</ref> and of [[Lady Charles Bentinck|Anne Wellesley]], formerly Lady Abdy.<ref>[http://worldroots.com/brigitte/royal/bio/annewellesleybio.html Anne Wellesley]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211005328/http://worldroots.com/brigitte/royal/bio/annewellesleybio.html |date=February 11, 2007 }}</ref> He had a younger brother, Arthur Cavendish Bentinck, and two sisters, Anne and Emily.

Their paternal grandparents were [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], and Dorothy Cavendish, a daughter of [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire]], another Prime Minister, by his marriage to [[Charlotte Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Lady Charlotte Boyle]], a daughter of [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington]]. Their maternal grandparents were [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]], and his wife [[Hyacinthe-Gabrielle Roland]], a former actress at the [[Palais Royal]]. Wellesley, a [[Governor-General of India]], was an older brother of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], another Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.stirnet.com/genie/data/british/ww/wellesley2.php |title=Wellesley family genealogy |work=stirnet.com |year=2013 |accessdate=25 November 2013}} (Subscription required)</ref>

When they were born, there seemed only a remote possibility of Bentinck or his brother succeeding to the family's peerages, as their father's eldest brother, the 4th Duke of Portland, already had several sons, and their father had another older brother, [[Lord William Bentinck]] (1774–1839). Bentinck was educated at [[Merton College, Oxford]], where his paternal grandfather the 3rd Duke had been Chancellor, matriculating on 1 June 1837, and later at [[New Inn Hall]], Oxford, while his brother decided to follow a military career. Bentinck eventually took the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1845, promoted to Master of Arts in 1846.<ref>{{alox2|title=Bentinck, Rev. Charles William Cavendish}}</ref>

On 26 September 1839, while still an Oxford undergraduate, at [[St George's, Hanover Square]], Bentinck married his first wife, Sinetta Lambourne, daughter of James Lambourne, a horse dealer with some claim to be the founder of [[Summertown, Oxford]], where he lived, with his wife Sinetta Smith, a gypsy.<ref>John Badcock ''The Making of a Regency Village: Origin, History and Description of Summertown in 1832'' (St Michael's Publications, Oxford, 1983). This is a transcript of notes made by Badcock in 1832 for the incoming vicar.</ref> Bentinck stated his address as [[Brook Street]], while Sinetta gave hers as Southwick Street, Paddington. They soon had two sons, but both died in infancy:
*Charles William Cavendish Bentinck, born 1840, who died at 19 days old.
*Charles Cavendish Bentinck, born 1841, died 1842.
The cause of death for both children was "convulsions", and both were buried at All Souls, [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], where Sinetta Bentick (error) nee Lambourne  was also interred.

After taking his degree, Bentinck confirmed his intention of becoming a [[Church of England]] clergyman and was appointed as Vicar of [[Husborne Crawley]], [[Bedfordshire]], a [[benefice]] in the gift of [[Francis Russell, 7th Duke of Bedford]]. On 23 November 1849, the Duke of Bedford also appointed him as vicar of [[Ridgmont]], Bedfordshire. In both parishes, he was known as William Charles Cavendish Bentinck.<ref>[http://www.bedfordshire.gov.uk/communityandliving/archivesandrecordoffice/communityarchives/ridgmont/ridgmontchurches.aspx Ridgmont Churches] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926004612/http://www.bedfordshire.gov.uk/CommunityAndLiving/ArchivesAndRecordOffice/CommunityArchives/Ridgmont/RidgmontChurches.aspx |date=2016-09-26 }} at Bedfordshire.government.uk, accessed 29 August 2016</ref><ref>Census of 1851, Ridgmount, Bedfordshire</ref>

The possibility of Bentinck becoming Duke of Portland was increasing, as his uncle [[William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland]] died on 27 March 1854 and all four of his sons were unmarried or dead. The eldest, [[William Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, Marquess of Titchfield|William, Marquess of Titchfield]], had died in 1824, and [[Lord George Bentinck|Lord George]] on 21 September 1848. The eccentric [[William Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland|Lord William]] (who succeeded his father as the 5th Duke of Portland) and the youngest son, [[Lord Henry Bentinck|Lord Henry]], both remained unmarried. Bentinck himself was the next heir after Lord Henry, however, he was also childless at the time: his wife Sinetta had died at Ampthill on 19 February 1850, of [[mesentery]],<ref>Register of Deaths for Ampthill Registrar's District, 1850, vol. 6, p. 4</ref> leaving Bentinck a widower with no surviving children.

On 13 December 1859, Bentinck married for the second time. His bride was [[Louisa Cavendish-Bentinck|Caroline Louisa Burnaby]], a daughter of [[Edwyn Burnaby (courtier)|Edwyn Burnaby]], of the [[landed gentry]], and of [[Anne Caroline Salisbury]]. She bore him a further three children, all daughters:

*[[Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne]] (1862–1938)
*Ann Violet Cavendish-Bentinck (1864 – 5 May 1932)
*Hyacinth Sinetta Cavendish-Bentinck (1864 – 9 December 1916), who married Augustus Edward Jessop

Bentinck died on 17 August 1865, aged 47, at Ridgmont, and was buried at [[Croxton, Cambridgeshire]]. His cousin Lord Henry William died on 31 December 1870, and the 5th Duke followed on 6 December 1879. Thus, the next Duke was Bentinck's nephew [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland|William Cavendish-Bentinck]], a son of Lt.-General Arthur Cavendish Bentinck, Bentinck's younger brother, who had died in 1877.

In 1881, Bentinck's daughter Nina Cecilia married [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne]], and became the mother of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] (1900–2002) and the grandmother of Queen [[Elizabeth II]].
