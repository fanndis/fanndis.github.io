The following week, at the Hobart International she lost to [[Anabel Medina Garrigues]] in the first round. At the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]] she avenged that loss in the first round, but lost in the second to [[Maria Elena Camerin]], in a very close three-set match.

Her losing streak ended in the hands of [[Urszula Radwańska]] in the first round of the [[2007 J&S Cup|J&S Cup]], but lost in the next to [[Jelena Janković]].

In her next main-draw appearance, Vesnina reached the quarterfinals at the [[Internationaux de Strasbourg]] she lost to Marion Bartoli for the first time in three meetings. At the [[2007 French Open|French Open]], she was drawn against No. 1 seed and eventual champion [[Justine Henin]] of Belgium in the first round, and lost in two relatively close sets. The following week, at the [[Ordina Open]], she got through as a qualifier but lost in the second round to [[Angelique Kerber]]. Entering [[2007 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]] world-ranked 67th in July, she enjoyed a strong start with successive comfortable straight-sets wins over fellow-Russian world No. 32, [[Olga Puchkova]], in the first round and world No. 43, [[Émilie Loit]], in the second, before losing once again to top-seed and eventual semifinalist Justine Henin, in the third round. Following Wimbledon she competed at the [[2007 Cincinnati Masters|Cincinnati Open]] where she reached the quarterfinals losing to eventual champion and compatriot Anna Chakvetadze, until retiring.

At the [[2007 Nordea Nordic Light Open|Nordic Light Open]], Vesnina defeated Swedish world No. 109, [[Sofia Arvidsson]], in straight sets in the first round, but then lost to fast-rising Danish teenager [[Caroline Wozniacki]], in the second. She then competed in the last tournament before the US Open at the [[2007 Forest Hills Tennis Classic|Forest Hills Classic]], after receiving a first-round bye, she began well with straight-sets victories over world No. 68, [[Séverine Brémond]], and Japanese world No. 52, [[Aiko Nakamura]], to reach her career-first WTA-level semifinal, but then lost to [[Virginie Razzano]]. Entering the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Vesnina was drawn to play world No. 89 [[Jelena Kostanić]] in the first round, but lost to her in straight sets.

The following week, representing Russia in the [[2007 Fed Cup]] final against Italy, Vesnina avenged her straight sets defeat by Mara Santangelo in their only previous meeting, by outplaying world No. 34 to win in straight sets herself this time around. Towards the end of the month, the Russian could reach only the second round of the [[Banka Koper Slovenia Open]] before she succumbed to [[Gisela Dulko]].

Returning to the Tashkent Open in October ranked 61st in the world, Vesnina exceeded her performance of the previous year by reaching the semifinals with successive victories over [[Alberta Brianti]], [[Tatiana Poutchek]], and Romanian youngster [[Ioana Raluca Olaru]], but at this stage, she lost Belarusian teenager [[Victoria Azarenka]]. At the [[2007 Kremlin Cup|Kremlin Cup]], she lost once again to Czech world No. 13 [[Nicole Vaidišová]] in the second round.

She ended the year at No. 54, ten spots lower than the previous year.

===2008===
Back in Australia for the beginning of the new season early in January, Vesnina suffered a poor start with a three-set loss in the first round at Gold Coast to an Australian wild card then ranked just 158th in the world, [[Monique Adamczak]]. Having failed to defend the points accrued from her quarterfinal finish at Gold Coast a year previously, she found her ranking slipping to 60th. But she mostly made up for it by reaching the quarterfinals at Hobart the following week with back-to-back straight-sets wins over world No. 48, [[Akiko Morigami]], and Nuria Llagostera Vives. But her quarterfinal opponent, world No. 23 [[Vera Zvonareva]], had the better of her.

Entering the Australian Open for the third year running, now ranked 55th, Vesnina enjoyed a marginally more successful run than she had done in 2007, in reaching the third round with successive wins over world No. 31 [[Julia Vakulenko]] and world No. 98 [[Jill Craybas]]. However, there was no stopping eventual tournament champion [[Maria Sharapova]] in the third round. Vesnina emerged from the tournament ranked No. 52. With only 16 ranking points for her to defend between February and April inclusive out of 549 to her credit, she was presented with a strong theoretical opportunity to return to or exceed her pre-existing career-high WTA world ranking of 41st by the beginning of May.

However, Vesnina's challenge began disappointingly for her at Doha in mid-February with a first-round main-draw loss in straight sets to world No. 134, [[Ayumi Morita]]. Then at the Tier II tournament at Dubai, she was forced to go through the qualifying tournament, where she was defeated in the second round on the final-set tie-break of a very close three-set match by [[Zheng Jie]], whose then-current ranking of world No. 226 reflected her recent absence from the tour resulting from injury. The sum total of the ranking points earned by the Russian in February was just six.

Returning to action in mid-March at the Tier I fixture taking place at Indian Wells, Vesnina could manage only the second round of the main draw after defeating world No. 98, [[Hsieh Su-wei]], in a close three-set match in the first, as world No. 10, Marion Bartoli, vanquished her, leveling up their career head-to-head at two matches all.

[[File:Elena-vesnina.png|thumb|left|Vesnina at the [[2008 US Open (tennis)|2008 US Open]]]]
Arriving at Miami at the end of March ranked 53rd, Vesnina finally achieved a measure of success for the first time in two months, reaching the fourth round with wins over [[Elena Likhovtseva]], world No. 18 [[Ágnes Szávay]], and improved world No. 60, [[Ashley Harkleroad]], before succumbing to world No. 1, Justine Henin. The 70 ranking points she earned from this performance lifted her comfortably within the top 50 again at No. 45, with 638 ranking points, but still left her some 50 points adrift of the current standard required to match her previous best ranking of 41st.

At the Tier II Amelia Island in early April, Vesnina reached the third round after defeating Venezuelan star [[Milagros Sequera]] and world No. 12, [[Patty Schnyder]]. But then she lost to much-improved world No. 49, [[Alizé Cornet]]. As a result, she achieved a net gain of just 25 ranking points to 663, and only one ranking place.

===2009: First Grand Slam doubles final===
Vesnina participated in the [[2009 ASB Classic|ASB Classic]] in Auckland in January. It was here that she advanced to her first final on the [[2009 WTA Tour]], upsetting the tournament's sixth-seed Nicole Vaidišová in the second round and the second seed Caroline Wozniacki in the quarterfinals along the way. She then prevailed in a marathon semifinal against British No. 1, [[Anne Keothavong]], with a score of to set up a meeting with fellow-Russian and tournament top seed Elena Dementieva. She started strongly in the match with a 3–1 lead but eventually lost to Dementieva.

In the third round, she defeated 12th-seeded [[Dominika Cibulková]], who retired after Vesnina was leading. In the quarterfinals, her series of upsets ended when she lost to 16th-seeded Kaia Kanepi.

She is right-handed and plays with a two-handed backhand. Her game is centred around getting control in rallies by using her groundstrokes to dominate play or move her opponents around the court in order to find an opening. Her forehand is consistent and powerful, but her backhand is her strongest shot. She uses it to find many angles on the court and dominate play. She possesses a good serve and regularly hits it between 100 and 110&nbsp;mph (161–177&nbsp;km/h), but relies on placement and accuracy to dominate and serve aces. However, she can also encounter problems with her second serve, and this can result in a few double faults in a match.

Vesnina's doubles career and play has meant, she has amassed good volleying skills and reflexes and can apply her net-play to singles. She is also very crafty around the court and frequently uses a variety of drop shots, volleys and angles to win points. Her movement and footwork around the court is very good, and she can move and accelerate around the court laterally very well. Her footwork is also very precise, and she is very good at recovering and setting herself up for the next shot.

Vesnina's clothing sponsor used to be [[Lacoste]] but just before the [[2017 Australian Open]], she was signed by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. She is also endorsed by [[Babolat]] for her racquets. She endorses the Babolat Pure Strike range of racquets.
