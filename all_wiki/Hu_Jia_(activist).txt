==Biography==
Hu's parents were students at [[Tsinghua University]] in Beijing and [[Nankai University]] in Tianjin in 1957 when they were labeled as rightists during the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]] under Mao Zedong.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} They were assigned to work in remote provinces of Hebei, Gansu, and Hunan. His parents often had to live apart until 1978, when [[Deng Xiaoping]] came to power and political label held against them was dropped.

In 1996 Hu graduated from the Beijing School of Economics (now [[Capital University of Economics and Trade]], 首都经济贸易大学), where he majored in information engineering.

In January 2006 Hu married [[Zeng Jinyan]], with whom he has a daughter. Zeng was included in ''Time'' magazine's 100 Heroes and Pioneers for her blogging<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/time100/article/0,28804,1595326_1615754_1616169,00.html | title=Zeng Jinyan - The TIME 100 | magazine=[[TIME Magazine]] | accessdate=2008-10-24 | date=2007-05-03}}</ref> after his arrest in February 2008 for voicing his indignation at China as the host of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]. Both his wife and daughter were held in house arrest and harassed by the [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]], and disappeared one day before the opening ceremony in Beijing.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/09/asia/AS-China-Human-Rights.php/ | title=Chinese rights activist Zeng Jinyan disappears | newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=9 August 2008 | accessdate=2008-10-24 | agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref>

== Activism ==
{{BLP sources section|date=October 2008}}
Hu became interested in environmental issues while in university and participated in several environmental organizations including the [[Friends of Nature (China)|Friends of Nature]], led by [[Liang Congjie]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031004132925/http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/liangNGO.htm Chinese Environmentalist Liang Congjie On NGO Life]</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/MATERIAL/158625.htm | title=The Soul of China's Environmental NGOs | publisher=[[China Internet Information Center]] | date=20 February 2006 | author=Zhang Tingting | accessdate=2008-10-24}}</ref> and the 1997 Green Camp university student environmental camp led by [[Tang Xiyang]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020327093834/http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/tang2.htm "Tang Xiyang Writes About 1996 Green Camp and the Loss of His Wife"]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020320051349/http://www.usembassy-china.org.cn/sandt/tangcensor.html A Section Censored from Tang Xiyang's Environmental Book "A Green World Tour"]</ref> In 1998 Hu Jia was involved in rescuing some wild elk that were threatened by severe flooding that year. Hu was subsequently involved in efforts to protect the Tibetan Antelope that were being slaughtered for their fur.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/hu-jia-chinas-enemy-within-804589.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Hu Jia: China's enemy within | date=4 April 2008}}</ref>

In July 2000, the writer [[Wang Lixiong]] introduced Hu to AIDS activist [[Wan Yanhai]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Afterwards Hu Jia became involved in AIDS prevention work and took an active part in the AIZIBING Institute of Health Education AIDS, which Wan Yanhai had founded.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}  As one of the founders [[Loving Source]] a [[non-governmental organization]] and advocacy group for individuals with AIDS, Hu Jia has been involved in helping people suffering from AIDS and AIDS orphans in [[Henan]] province. He has criticized the government over its treatment of people with AIDS.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}  According to [[Amnesty International]], Hu has since resigned from Loving Source to prevent the authorities from harassing the group.

Hu has also been involved in campaigns to release [[political prisoner]]s, including Wan Yanhai in August–September 2002 and the [[cyber-dissident]] [[Liu Di]] ("The Stainless Steel Rat").{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} In 2003, Hu Jia lodged a letter of complaint to the European Court of Human Rights over German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schroeder]]'s refusal to meet with the [[Dalai Lama]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}  In 2005 he participated in [[2005 anti-Japanese demonstrations|anti-Japanese demonstrations]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/05/international/asia/05china.html|title=Chinese Police Head Off Anti-Japan Protests |last=Yardley|first=Jim|date=May 5, 2005|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

Hu insists on his rights as a citizen of the People's Republic in China. When [[Chinese public security bureau|police]] detain him (often for planned activities and sometimes to ensure that he is not active at sensitive times such as June 4, the  [[anniversary]] of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]) Hu demands that the police state what provision of [[Law of the People's Republic of China|Chinese law]] he is being held under. Hu says that the security officers are generally unable to do so.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In 2006, Beijing Zhiaixing Information Counseling Center (formerly called Aizhixing Institute of Health Education), a human rights advocacy group with which Hu was affiliated,{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} received combined grant of $179,113 from [[National Endowment for Democracy]] and [[US State Department]] for conducting programs within China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ned.org/grants/06programs/grants-asia06.html#china |work=Grants Program -Asia |title=China section |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-10-24 |publisher=[[National Endowment for Democracy]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509025436/http://www.ned.org/grants/06programs/grants-asia06.html#china |archivedate=2008-05-09 |url-status=dead }} Item 10.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=China Human Rights and Rule of Law Update | url=http://www.cecc.gov/pages/general/newsletters/CECCnewsletter20061208.pdf | page=8 | accessdate=2008-10-27 | publisher=[[Congressional-Executive Commission on China]] | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226201657/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/general/newsletters/CECCnewsletter20061208.pdf | archivedate=2007-12-26 }}</ref>

On February 16, 2006, Hu was detained for 41 days.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://china.hrw.org/press/news_release/hu_jia_chronology|title= Hu Jia Chronology|year=2008|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}</ref> His detention was not acknowledged by the Chinese government.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} After his return to his apartment in Beijing, where he lives with his wife [[Zeng Jinyan]] (also an AIDS activist), Hu Jia was kept under [[house arrest]] until March 2007. Two months later, on May 18, 2007, Hu Jia and his wife were placed under house arrest again on charges of "harming state security." Hu Jia has remained active via [[email]]s and [[blog]]s while under house arrests.

Using a web camera, Hu participated in a European parliamentary hearing in Brussels in November 2007 about [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights in China]]. At the hearing he said: "It is ironic that one of the people in charge of organizing the Olympic Games is the head of the Bureau of Public Security, which is responsible for so many human rights violations. It is very serious that the official promises are not being kept before the games."<ref name="kahn">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/world/asia/web30china.html | date=30 December 2007 | title=China Detains Dissident, Citing Subversion | last=Kahn | first=Joseph | accessdate=2008-10-24 | newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>

==Illness==

In April 2010, Hu's family got to know that he was sent to prison hospital for medical check of symptoms suspected to be liver cancer but no information of the medical report was released to his family.  Hu's wife Ms Zeng requested for the detailed medical report but was denied access.  She and Hu's mother requested for medical parole but the prison administration rejected by saying that Hu's disease is not liver cancer, and he might not be released for medical care even if he had liver cancer.<ref>[https://docs.google.com/View?id=dggqrqvn_6dwfkp2fc Zeng Jinyan's Emergency Call for Medical Parole after Hu Jia entered hospital for suspected liver cancer]</ref>

On April 7, Ms Zeng published an open letter on Internet, requesting medical parole of Mr. Hu.  Shortly later, Ms [[Ai Xiaoming]] and Ms [[Cui Weiping]], two renowned university professors who are also active in human rights activities, published an open letter<ref>[https://twitter.com/xiaocao07/status/11855636937 Urgent Appeal by Ai Xiaoming for Medical Parole of Hu Jia]</ref> on Internet, appealing public support for Ms Zeng's request of medical parole of Mr. Hu.<ref>[https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AabmhXwCSbSdZGhjdnhobWtfNDBmZmtmcWs3bQ Urgent Appeal by Ai Xiaoming & Cui Weiping]</ref>  In less than 10 days, over 700 people endorsed the open letter through email and web forms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2AnU7DUJCDGdTWfhhvZtHdqN_mwF1-0h6I4y9EJbLAKAqWA/viewform?formkey=dE1hYnh3d1hVZWZSMW0yQWdaZlN3c1E6MQ&usp=embed_facebook|title=有关胡佳保外就医的紧急公民呼吁书|website=Google Docs|language=en|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>

On December 5, 2014, notable CPC member [[Zhou Yongkang]] was expelled from the party after being accused of alleged corruption. The following day, Hu commented on the [[Anti-corruption campaign in China|recent anti-corruption campaign of the CPC]] stating "Zhou challenged Xi's authority and threatened his rule - that's why he's now being held responsible along with his gangs. The bottom line is: All officials are corrupt. Xi can't find a better excuse to rid of his political opponents than fighting corruption- something that helps him win the masses' hearts and minds."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2014/12/05/world/asia/china-zhou-yongkang/index.html|title=Zhou Yongkang: China snares its biggest 'tiger'|author=Steven Jiang|website=CNN|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>
