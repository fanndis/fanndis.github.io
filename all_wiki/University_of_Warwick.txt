==History==
===Twentieth century===
[[File:Library Under Construction 1965.png|thumb|Library Under Construction 1960's]]
The idea for a university in Warwickshire was first mooted shortly after [[World War II]], although it was not founded for a further two decades.  A partnership of the city and county councils ultimately provided the impetus for the university to be established on a {{convert|400|acre|km2|adj=on}} site jointly granted by the two authorities.<ref name="rees">Rees, H., ''A University is Born'', Avalon Books, Coventry (1989)</ref> There was some discussion between local sponsors from both the city and county over whether it should be named after Coventry or Warwickshire.<ref name="rees" />  The name "University of Warwick" was adopted, even though [[Warwick]], the county town, lies some {{convert|8|mi|km}} to its southwest and [[Coventry]]'s city centre is only {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} northeast of the campus.<ref>A compromise was proposed by [[Geoffrey Templeman]], Deputy Chairman of the university's planning committee, who later became the first [[Vice-Chancellor]] of Kent University on the border between the City of [[Canterbury]] and the county of [[Kent]] which faced a similar naming issue, and adopted the name [[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]]. However, the name the 'University of Warwick at Coventry' was not adopted.</ref><ref>[[Graham Martin]], ''From Vision to Reality: the Making of the University of Kent at Canterbury'' (1990) page 29 {{ISBN|0-904938-03-4}}</ref><ref>Its creation was supported by [[University of Birmingham]] Vice-Chancellor [[Sir Robert Aitken]] who acted as 'Godfather to the University of Warwick'.  The initial plan was for a university college at Coventry attached to Birmingham but Aitken advised an independent initiative to the University Grants Committee.</ref><ref>Ives, E. (2000). The First Civic University: Birmingham, 1880–1980 – An Introductory History. Birmingham: University of Birmingham Press</ref> The establishment of the University of Warwick was given approval by the government in 1961 and it received its [[Royal Charter]] of Incorporation in 1965. Since then, the university has incorporated the former [[Coventry College of Education]] in 1979 and has extended its land holdings by the continuing purchase of adjoining farm land. The university also benefited from a substantial donation from the family of John 'Jack' Martin, a Coventry businessman who had made a fortune from investment in [[Smirnoff]] vodka, and which enabled the construction of the [[Warwick Arts Centre]].

The university initially admitted a small intake of graduate students in 1964 and took its first 450 undergraduates in October 1965. Since its establishment Warwick has expanded its grounds to {{convert|721|acre|km2|1}}, with many modern buildings and academic facilities, lakes, and woodlands. In the 1960s and 1970s, Warwick had a reputation as a politically radical institution.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sunion.warwick.ac.uk/30year/protests_and_campaigns.htm |title=University of Warwick Student Union |accessdate=30 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102174507/http://www.sunion.warwick.ac.uk/30year/protests_and_campaigns.htm |archivedate=2 November 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Under Vice-Chancellor [[Lord Butterworth]], Warwick was the first UK university to adopt a business approach to higher education, develop close links with the business community and exploit the commercial value of its research. These tendencies were discussed by British historian and then-Warwick lecturer, [[E. P. Thompson]], in his 1970 edited book ''Warwick University Ltd.''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Warwick University Ltd.|last=Thompson|first=E. P.|publisher=Spokesman Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Nottingham|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>

On the recommendation of [[Tony Blair]], [[Bill Clinton]] chose Warwick as the venue for his last major foreign policy address as [[President of the United States|US President]] in December 2000. [[Sandy Berger]], Clinton’s [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], explaining the decision in a press briefing on 7 December 2000, said that: "Warwick is one of Britain's newest and finest research universities, singled out by [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair|Blair]] as a model both of academic excellence and independence from the government."<ref name=":2">[https://warwick.ac.uk/services/communications/corporate/clinton/whitehousebrief/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050505084252/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/communications/corporate/clinton/whitehousebrief/|date=5 May 2005}}</ref>

In September 2015, Warwick celebrated its 50th anniversary (1965–2015) and was designated "University of the Year" by ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/student-news-round-up-university-of-the-year-goes-to-warwick-and-the-cambridge-phd-who-quit-to-9750965.html.|title=University of the year goes to Warwick|work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=22 May 2018|date=23 September 2014}}</ref> 

==Campus==
Warwick is located on the outskirts of [[Coventry]], {{convert|5.5|km|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} southwest of the city centre (and not in the town of [[Warwick]] as its name suggests). The university's main site comprises three contiguous campuses, all within walking distance of each other. The university also owns a site in [[Wellesbourne]], acquired in 2004 when it merged with [[Horticulture Research International]].

===Main campus===
The main Warwick campus occupies {{convert|2.88|km2|acre|order=flip}} between the City of [[Coventry]] and the County of [[Warwickshire]]. The original buildings of the campus are in contemporary 1960s architecture. The campus contains all of the main student amenities, all but four of the student halls of residence, and the Students' Union. The campus is split between the parliamentary constituencies of Kenilworth and Southam <ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Parliamentary_constituencies_in_Warwickshire |title=Parliamentary constituencies in Warwickshire |website=Wikipedia |accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}} and Coventry South.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry_South_(UK_Parliament_constituency) |title=Coventry South constituency |website=Wikipedia |accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}}

==== Warwick Arts Centre ====
{{main|Warwick Arts Centre}}
The Warwick Arts Centre is a multi-venue arts complex situated at the centre of Warwick's main campus. It attracts around 300,000 visitors a year to over 3,000 individual events spanning contemporary and classical music, drama, dance, comedy, films and visual art. The centre comprises six principal spaces: the Butterworth Hall, a 1,500-seat concert hall; a 550-seat theatre; a 180-seat theatre studio; a 220-seat cinema; the Mead Gallery, an art gallery; and the Music Centre, with practice rooms, and an ensemble rehearsal room where music societies and groups can rehearse. In addition the site includes the university bookshop, hospitality suites, a restaurant, cafe, shops, and two bars.

====University House====
In 2003 Warwick acquired the former headquarters of [[National Grid plc|National Grid]], which it converted into an administration building renamed University House.  There is a student-run facility called the ‘Learning Grid’ in the building, which includes two floors of PC clusters, scanners, photocopiers, a reference library, interactive whiteboards and plasma screens for use by individuals and for group work.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/librariesunleashed/story/0,,2275364,00.html|title=Warwick learning grid|accessdate=16 November 2011|work=The Guardian|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226082758/http://education.guardian.co.uk/librariesunleashed/story/0,,2275364,00.html|archivedate=26 December 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Planned developments===
{{Update section|date=May 2019}}
In November 2005, Warwick announced its vision for the year 2020 and outlined proposals for how it would like to develop its campus over the next 15 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/about/campusdevelopment/|title=Campus Development—The Masterplan |publisher=warwick.ac.uk|accessdate=19 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102114017/https://warwick.ac.uk/about/campusdevelopment/|archivedate=2 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The proposals built upon recent construction activity including a new Mathematics and Statistics Building, a new Computer Science Building, new Business School buildings, the Digital Laboratory, the new Heronbank Residences and an expanded Sports Centre. The proposals envisage a shift in the "centre of gravity" of the campus away from the Students' Union towards University House and a proposed "Academic Square" located around the new maths and computer science buildings.

Forthcoming projects include an inter-disciplinary biosciences research facility; a £25 million upgrade to Warwick Business School; and the National Automotive Innovation Campus, a new £150 million venture funded by Jaguar Land Rover and the UK government. The NAIC's purpose is to research and develop novel technologies to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and to reduce CO2 emissions. The new {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} campus will provide research opportunities for postgraduates from 2016 onwards. The campus has been dubbed a ‘brain trust’ and will be used to pioneer the green and high-tech sports and luxury cars of tomorrow, doubling the size of Jaguar’s research team.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cooke|first=Daniel|title=£100m investment boost for Warwick University|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/100m-investment-boost-for-warwick-university-8839352.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=25 September 2013|location=London|accessdate=31 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130222917/https://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/100m-investment-boost-for-warwick-university-8839352.html|archivedate=30 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Later in 2017, the University released its 2030 vision which will see an exponential growth of its main campus in order to remain "world-class" and cope with the growing number of applications it receives each year, especially from non-UK students (41% of the student population).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://warwick.ac.uk/about/strategy/ |title=The University of Warwick Strategy 2018 to 2030 |accessdate=21 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102144331/https://warwick.ac.uk/about/strategy |archivedate=2 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> This growth will include a new £33 million Faculty of Arts, a £55 million new sports centre (finished in April 2019), a new £54.3 million Interdisciplinary Biomedical Research Building (IBRB), a new type of student accommodation called "Cryfield village", the expansion of Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), a redevelopment for the Art centre and a new Library (scheduled in 5 years time).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://warwick.ac.uk/about/campus/developments/ |title=Developments &#124; Our Campus &#124; University of Warwick |accessdate=21 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806012228/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/about/campus/developments |archivedate=6 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> For this occasion, Stuart Croft, vice chancellor of the university declared "New buildings are and will continue to be a part of our everyday existence. We need to open one new academic building a year from now until at least 2023. In order to do this and to keep Warwick as one of the world’s leading universities, we need to do this together, involving the whole community."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://warwick.ac.uk/about/community/campusdevelopments/ |title=Campus developments |accessdate=21 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831122308/https://warwick.ac.uk/about/community/campusdevelopments |archivedate=31 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://warwick.ac.uk/about/campus/developments/ |title=Developments &#124; Our Campus &#124; University of Warwick |accessdate=21 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806012228/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/about/campus/developments |archivedate=6 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://warwick.ac.uk/about/strategy/ |title=The University of Warwick Strategy 2018 to 2030 |accessdate=21 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190102144331/https://warwick.ac.uk/about/strategy |archivedate=2 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Library===
The main university library is located in the middle of the main campus. It houses approximately 1,265,000 books<ref>{{cite web| url        = https://warwick.ac.uk/services/library/main/basics/about/facts/| title        = Library Statistics| date        = 9 November 2011| work        = University of Warwick| publisher        = University of Warwick Library| archiveurl        = https://web.archive.org/web/20120110103836/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/basics/about/facts| archivedate        = 10 January 2012| url-status        = dead| accessdate        = 10 January 2012 }}</ref> and over 13&nbsp;km of archives and manuscripts. The main library houses services to support Research and Teaching practice and collaboration between departments. The [[Wolfson Research Exchange]] opened in October 2008 and provides collaboration spaces (both physical and virtual), seminar rooms, conference facilities and study areas for Postgraduate Research students. The Teaching Grid, which opened in 2008, is a flexible space which allows teaching staff to try out new technologies and techniques. Adjacent to the main library building is the [[Modern Records Centre]], a sizeable archive collection, including the UK's largest industrial relations collection.

===Awards===
In 2008 the university launched a new prize, the [[Warwick Prize for Writing]], worth £50,000. It is defined as "an international cross-disciplinary award which will be given biennially for an excellent and substantial piece of writing in the English language, in any genre or form, on a theme that will change with every award". The inaugural winner of the award was [[Naomi Klein]] for her critically acclaimed book ''Shock Doctrine''.

==Research==
In 2013/14 Warwick had a total research income of £90.1 million, of which £33.9 million was from Research Councils; £25.9 million was from central government, local authorities and public corporations; £12.7 million was from the European Union; £7.9 million was from UK industry and commerce; £5.2 million was from UK charitable bodies; £4.0 million was from overseas sources; and £0.5 million was from other sources.<ref name=annacc/>

In the 2014 UK [[Research Excellence Framework]] (REF), Warwick was again ranked 7th overall (as 2008) amongst multi-faculty institutions and was the top-ranked university in the Midlands.<ref name="RAE 2008">{{cite web |url=https://warwick.ac.uk/insite/newsandevents/intnews2/rae_2008_150 |title=RAE 2008 Outstanding Results |publisher=University of Warwick |accessdate=16 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714054931/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/insite/newsandevents/intnews2/rae_2008_150 |archivedate=14 July 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Some 87% of the University's academic staff were rated as being in "world-leading" or "internationally excellent" departments with top research ratings of 4* or 3*.<ref name="RAE 2008"/>

Warwick is particularly strong in the areas of decision sciences research (economics, finance, management, mathematics and statistics). For instance, researchers of the Warwick Business School have won the highest prize of the prestigious European Case Clearing House (ECCH: the equivalent of the Oscars in terms of management research).<ref>{{cite web |last=Bradshaw |first=Della |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/07e23e0c-7c57-11e2-99f0-00144feabdc0.html |title=Warwick, Harvard and Insead scoop the academic 'Oscars' |work=Financial Times |date=25 February 2013 |accessdate=16 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301045204/http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/07e23e0c-7c57-11e2-99f0-00144feabdc0.html |archivedate=1 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Warwick has established a number of stand-alone units to manage and extract commercial value from its research activities. The four most prominent examples of these units are [[University of Warwick Science Park]]; [[Warwick HRI]]; Warwick Ventures (the technology transfer arm of the University); and [[WMG (formerly Warwick Manufacturing Group)|WMG]].

===Commercial focus===
Warwick has at times received criticism for being too commercially focused, at the expense of academic creativity and diversity. The most famous proponent of this critique was the noted historian [[E.P. Thompson]], who edited and wrote much of  ''Warwick University Ltd'' in 1971.<ref>{{cite book| title     = Warwick University Limited| author    = E. P. Thompson| isbn      = 978-0-14-080230-6| publisher = Penguin| year      = 1970}}</ref> The book focuses on the brief student occupation of the Registry in 1967, and its causes, the files that were discovered and published, and the subsequent actions of the university, students and staff.

Nevertheless, with the appointment of [[Nick Scheele|Sir Nicholas Scheele]] as Chancellor in 2002, the university signalled that it intended to continue and expand its commercial activities. In an interview for the BBC, Scheele said: "I think in the future, education and industry need to become even more closely linked than they have been historically. As government funding changes, the replacement could well come through private funding from companies, individuals and grant-giving agencies."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2342371.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ford boss: 'Business to fund universities' | date=19 October 2002 | accessdate=28 March 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220174545/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2342371.stm | archivedate=20 December 2007 | url-status=live }}</ref>

==Student life==

Undergraduate student life at Warwick can be broadly divided into two phases. In the first year, student life revolves around campus and, in particular, the Students' Union (with its sports clubs, societies, and entertainment facilities). In subsequent years students typically live off-campus, in [[Leamington Spa]], or in either the Coventry suburbs of [[Earlsdon]] and [[Canley]] or the town of [[Kenilworth]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Students' Union===
{{main|University of Warwick Students' Union}}
The University of Warwick Students' Union is one of the largest [[students' union]]s in the UK, and currently has over 260 societies and 67 sports clubs including basketball, [[University of Warwick Boat Club|rowing]] and ice hockey. The Union has an annual turnover of approximately £6&nbsp;million, the profit from which is used to provide services to students and to employ its staff and [[sabbatical officer]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Union is divided into two buildings—SUHQ (mainly societies and administration and Restaurant Canopy) and The Union Building (entertainment facilities). The Union Building contains a three-room club venue known as "The Copper Rooms"; CAMRA-accredited "The Dirty Duck" pub; a popular bar called "The Terrace Bar"; Curiositea, a tea shop famous for its hot chocolates, cakes and vintage atmosphere; The Graduate, a postgraduate social and study space; and The Bread Oven, a design-your-own sandwich shop.

The Union is a member of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] (NUS) and [[National Postgraduate Committee]] (NPC).

===Student media===
Student media at Warwick includes:
* [[Radio Warwick]] (RAW) – student radio station
* ''[[The Boar (newspaper)|The Boar]]'' – newspaper distributed free across campus every second Wednesday<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/oct/09/studentmediaawards.students|title=The Guardian Student Media Awards 2006|work=The Guardian|date=9 October 2006|accessdate=19 August 2020}}</ref>
* [[‘Perspectives’]] – The Warwick Politics Society’s termly print magazine, radio show and online magazine 

===University Challenge===
A team from Warwick won BBC television's [[University Challenge]] competition for the first time in 2007, beating the title-holders [[University of Manchester]] in the final.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/6562691.stm|title=Warwick wins University Challenge|accessdate=21 December 2011|work=BBC News|date=17 April 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227120334/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/6562691.stm|archivedate=27 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Student housing===
{{Main|University of Warwick Halls of Residence}}
[[File:Sherbourne, University of Warwick.jpg|thumb|right|One of the Sherbourne residences]]
The Warwick campus currently has around 6,300 student bedrooms across a range of undergraduate and postgraduate residences. All of the residences are self-catered, and each has residential tutors and a warden.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/services/accommodation/studentaccommodation/all/campus/|title=Campus Accommodation|accessdate=4 February 2012|publisher=University of Warwick|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213192311/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/accommodation/studentaccommodation/all/campus|archivedate=13 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Warwick guarantees accommodation for all first-year undergraduate students, regardless of their present address. Many of the university's postgraduate population are also catered for, with some specific residences available for postgraduate living. Each residence accommodates a mixture of students both domestic and foreign, male and female, and, sometimes, undergraduate and postgraduate.

In their second and third years, many students live in one of the surrounding towns: either Coventry, Kenilworth or Royal Leamington Spa, where they can live in university-managed accommodation or independently owned residences. The most popular area of residence is the regency town of Royal Leamington Spa, which was included in the ''Sunday Times''<nowiki/>' 'Best Places to Live' list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leamingtonspapeople.co.uk/YES-OFFICIAL-Royal-Leamington-Spa-really-GREAT/story-18450124-detail/story.html|title=Yes!

Since 2011, Warwick has constructed two new halls of residences for the students. Bluebell, opened in 2011, offers accommodation in flats of 8 people, with a total of 505 single rooms for first-year undergraduates. The Sherbourne residences was opened in 2012, which similarly provides 527 ensuite rooms to first-years,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/services/accommodation/studentaccommodation/all/campus/residences/sherbourne/|title=Warwick Accommodation|accessdate=4 February 2012|publisher=University of Warwick|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503035726/http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/services/accommodation/studentaccommodation/all/campus/residences/sherbourne|archivedate=3 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> and was extended with a further 267 rooms in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/services/estates/developments/sherbourne_extension|title=Sherbourne Extension {{!}} Campus Timeline {{!}} University of Warwick|website=warwick.ac.uk|accessdate=27 April 2019}}</ref> Further new residences are under construction to provide over 700 new rooms on campus at the Cryfield village.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/services/estates/developments/new_cryfield|title=New Residences at Cryfield Village {{!}} Campus Timeline {{!}} University of Warwick|website=warwick.ac.uk|accessdate=27 April 2019}}</ref>

===Rape chat incident===
In May 2018, the student news website ''The Boar'' reported on the suspension of 11 individuals following an official complaint to the university over screenshots of a group messenger application in which current students proposed sexual assault against other students. The students were initially subject to precautionary suspensions. Following the conclusion of a police investigation which determined no criminal charges should be brought, the University suspended a number of them for 10 years.

Several of the students appealed this ruling and an independent review panned reduced their suspensions to 1 year, meaning that students would be free to attend the University while the complainants finished their degree. This gained substantial coverage in both national and student press.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47060367|title=Warwick students suspended over rape threats allowed to return early|website=BBC News|date=5 February 2019|accessdate=1 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201160101/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47060367|archivedate=1 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/feb/05/warwick-university-says-threat-pair-wont-return|title=Warwick University says rape threat pair won't return|last=editor|first=Richard Adams Education|date=5 February 2019|work=The Guardian|access-date=15 August 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Following the media attention the University published a series of letters from the Provost and Vice Chancellor on its website to justify the process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/insite/news/intnews2/vc_open_letter/|title=Open letter from VC Stuart Croft on group chat incident|website=Warwick University|date=1 February 2019|accessdate=5 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207015721/https://warwick.ac.uk/insite/news/intnews2/vc_open_letter/|archivedate=7 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Vice Chancellor's letter—which does not mention victims at all—was criticised in a response on ''The Boar''—a student-run news website that first publicised the incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theboar.org/2019/02/to-stuart-croft-the-victims-should-always-have-been-the-focus/|title=To Stuart Croft: The victims "should always have been the focus"|website=The Boar|accessdate=5 February 2019|date=2 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203010206/http://theboar.org/2019/02/to-stuart-croft-the-victims-should-always-have-been-the-focus/|archivedate=3 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  Later, via the University, he published a follow-up indicating that two of the men whose ban was lifted would not return.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47124483|title=Warwick students suspended for rape chat 'won't return'|website=BBC News|accessdate=5 February 2019|date=4 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204220637/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47124483|archivedate=4 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 28 May 2019 the [[BBC]] aired the documentary, 'The Warwick Uni Rape Chat Scandal', about the Rape Chat Incident.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Warwick Uni Rape Chat Scandal|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0799fyb/the-warwick-uni-rape-chat-scandal|language=en-GB|access-date=15 August 2019}}</ref> 

In June 2019, two of the victims sued Warwick with sexual harassment attorney Dr. [[Ann Olivarius]], who said "There has been a serious lack of leadership and moral courage in the people doing the investigation...These girls have been unnecessarily hurt. There has been terrible abuse and terrible harm done unnecessarily."<ref>"[https://thetab.com/uk/2019/06/06/two-warwick-group-chat-girls-are-suing-the-university-104267 Two Warwick group chat victims are suing the university]," ''The Tab'', 6 June 2019.</ref><ref>"[https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/warwick-university-rape-scandal-16395989 Students suing University of Warwick over rape group chat scandal]," ''Coventry Telegraph'', 8 June 2019.</ref><ref>"[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/warwick-apologises-response-rape-chat-scandal Warwick apologises for response to rape chat scandal]," ''Times Higher Education'', 10 July 2019.</ref>

In July 2019 the results of an external review conducted by solicitor Dr. Sharon Persaud was published.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/independent_external_review/press-release/|title=Our Press Release after our Independent External Review|website=warwick.ac.uk|access-date=15 August 2019}}</ref> The report found that Warwick University 'had been more concerned with its own reputational interests than in a fair or just assessment of the case', and that a 'legacy of mistrust' had been generated by the Rape Chat Incident.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/independent_external_review/review/#annexbtreated|title=Read the Independent External Review at the University of Warwick in full|website=warwick.ac.uk|access-date=15 August 2019}}</ref> The report concluded that the investigation conducted by the University had 'no common understanding of what the disciplinary process was for, what its philosophy was, how offending conduct was or should be weighed against mitigating features'. Having met with the Investigating Officer and having seen all documentation, Dr Persaud concluded that regarding the investigation, 'there was a profoundly unsatisfactory outcome for almost every single person involved.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/independent_external_review/review/#annexbtreated|title=Read the Independent External Review at the University of Warwick in full|website=warwick.ac.uk|access-date=15 August 2019}}</ref>
