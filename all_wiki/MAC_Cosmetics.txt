'''MAC Cosmetics''', stylized as '''M·A·C''', is a Canadian cosmetics manufacturer founded in [[Toronto]] in 1984 by Frank Toskan and Frank Angelo. The company is headquartered in [[New York City]] after becoming a subsidiary of [[Estée Lauder Companies]] in 1996. MAC is an acronym for ''Make-up Art Cosmetics''.

==History==
[[File:MAC in SM Aura, BGC.jpg|thumb|A MAC Cosmetics store in the SM Aura Premier mall in [[Bonifacio Global City]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]]]
The company's products were originally intended for makeup professionals, but are sold directly to consumers worldwide. Frank Toskan stated that he "first manufactured makeup for models, but then the models wanted this makeup for their sisters, friends, and so on... ".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = MAC, cosmétiquement correctLa marque canadienne aux grandes causes va s'implanter en France.|url = http://www.liberation.fr/economie/0101149156-mac-cosmetiquement-correctla-marque-canadienne-aux-grandes-causes-va-s-implanter-en-france|website = Libération.fr|access-date = 2016-02-20}}</ref>

In the 1990s, the brand had more than a hundred stores worldwide, earning 200 million [[French franc|francs]].<ref name=":0"/> The development of the brand internationally, the opening of new points of sale, and the adaptation of product lines tailored to each continent, left little time for the founders to create new products. In 1994, the [[Estée Lauder Companies]] took control of 51% of shares of MAC Cosmetics and began managing the business end<ref name="Schiro">{{Cite news|title = Frank Angelo, 49, Cosmetics Innovator, Dies|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/17/us/frank-angelo-49-cosmetics-innovator-dies.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1997-01-17|access-date = 2016-02-20|issn = 0362-4331|first = Anne-marie|last = Schiro}}</ref> while the two founders retained creative control. In 1997, co-founder Frank Angelo died of [[cardiac arrest]] during surgery at the age of 49.<ref name="Schiro"/> At that time, MAC had a [[revenue]] of US $250 million, which doubled ten years later.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Estée Lauder Inc. completed the acquisition in 1998,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-feb-28-fi-23826-story.html|title=Estee Lauder Buys Remaining MAC Equity|date=1998-02-28|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-05-23|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> and Frank Toskan decided to sell his remaining shares shortly thereafter before leaving the company at the end of the same year.

== Controversy ==
Controversy arose in September 2010 over the anticipated release of the MAC Rodarte collection, a collaborative effort with the fashion label [[Rodarte]], based on the border town of [[Ciudad Juárez]]. The city had been plagued by [[violence against women]] including [[feminicides in Ciudad Juárez|hundreds of female homicides]]. MAC first changed the names of Juarez-related products and eventually pulled the line before distribution,<ref>{{cite news |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |first=Amy |last=Odell |url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2010/08/mac_cancels_rodarte_line.html |title=M.A.C. Cancels Rodarte Line |date=August 17, 2010 }}</ref> and instead set up a [[charity (practice)|charity]] which raised over $3 million in 2 years.<ref>{{cite web |first=Sharon |last=Forrester |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/beauty/news/100720-rodarte-mac-make-up-juarez-controve.aspx |title=MAC's Rodarte Make-up Collection Sparks Controversy |work=[[British Vogue]] |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2015-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://laprensa-sandiego.org/breaking-news/cosmetics-boycott-launched/ |title=Cosmetics Boycott Launched |work=La Prensa San Diego |date=August 6, 2010 |accessdate=2015-07-17}}</ref>

MAC performs non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy,{{citation needed |date=August 2020 }} but MAC does perform animal testing where required by law.{{citation needed |date=August 2020 }} The Chinese government requires [[testing cosmetics on animals|testing on animals]] for many cosmetic products.{{citation needed |date=August 2020 }} This causes controversy for smaller brands that are "cruelty free" but were bought out by MAC; MAC becomes the parent company of the smaller brand and profits through the smaller brand.
