Chopra studied medicine in India before emigrating in 1970 to the United States, where he completed a residency in internal medicine and a fellowship in endocrinology. As a licensed physician, in 1980 he became chief of staff at the [[New England Memorial Hospital]] (NEMH).<ref name="restless" /> In 1985, he met [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] and became involved in the [[Transcendental Meditation movement|Transcendental Meditation (TM) movement]]. Shortly thereafter he resigned his position at NEMH to establish the [[Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health|Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center]].<ref name=baer2003 /> In 1993, Chopra gained a following after he was interviewed about his books on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.<ref name=dunkel2005>{{cite news|last=Dunkel|first=Tom|title=Inner Peacekeeper|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-04-29/news/0504290067_1_deepak-chopra-chopra-and-dr-pillar-candles|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|year=2005|access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref> He then left the TM movement to become the executive director of [[Sharp HealthCare]]'s Center for Mind-Body Medicine.

Chopra believes that a person may attain "perfect health", a condition "that is free from disease, that never feels pain", and "that cannot age or die".<ref name=baerp240/><ref name=perfect/> Seeing the human body as undergirded by a "quantum mechanical body" composed not of matter but of energy and information, he believes that "human aging is fluid and changeable; it can speed up, slow down, stop for a time, and even reverse itself," as determined by one's state of mind.<ref name=baerp240/><ref name=ageless/> He claims that his practices can also treat chronic disease.<ref name=aids /><ref name=AshmanBarringer2005 />

The ideas Chopra promotes have regularly been criticized by medical and scientific professionals as [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=Tompkins2008/><ref name=Nightline /><ref name=jaco/><ref name="Indie-Bullshit"/> The criticism has been described as ranging "from the dismissive to...damning".<ref name=Tompkins2008 /> Philosopher [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]] writes that Chopra, to justify his teachings, attempts to integrate [[Ayurveda]] with [[quantum mechanics]].<ref name="skepdic-web" /> Chopra says that what he calls "[[quantum healing]]" cures any manner of ailments, including cancer, through effects that he claims<!-- "these are his claims and basically no one else's" per edit summary for this revision--> are literally based on the same principles as quantum mechanics.<ref name=AshmanBarringer2005/> This has led [[physicists]] to object to his use of the term "quantum" in reference to medical conditions and the human body.<ref name=AshmanBarringer2005/>  [[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] has said that Chopra uses "quantum jargon as plausible-sounding [[Hocus pocus (magic)|hocus pocus]]".<ref>{{cite web

He married in India in 1970 before emigrating, with his wife, to the United States that same year.<ref name=dunkel2005 /> The Indian government had banned its doctors from sitting for the exam needed to practice in the US, consequently Chopra had to travel to Sri Lanka to take it.

Chopra's involvement with TM led to a meeting in 1985 with the leader of the TM movement, [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]], who asked him to establish an Ayurvedic health center.<ref name=baer2003>Baer 2003, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3655336?seq=5 p. 237].</ref><ref>Chopra 1991, p. 139ff</ref> He left his position at the NEMH. Chopra said that one of the reasons he left was his disenchantment at having to prescribe too many drugs: "[W]hen all you do is prescribe medication, you start to feel like a legalized drug pusher. That doesn't mean that all prescriptions are useless, but it is true that 80 percent of all drugs prescribed today are of optional or marginal benefit."<ref name=Ahmed>Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed, [http://world.mediamonitors.net/content/view/full/50186/ "The Crisis of Perception"], ''Media Monitors Network'', February 29, 2008.</ref>

He became the founding president of the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine, one of the founders of Maharishi Ayur-Veda Products International, and medical director of the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Health Center in Lancaster, Massachusetts. The center charged between $2,850 and $3,950 per week for Ayurvedic cleansing rituals such as massages, [[enema]]s and oil baths, and TM lessons cost an additional $1,000.

== Ideas and reception ==

Chopra believes that a person may attain "perfect health", a condition "that is free from disease, that never feels pain", and "that cannot age or die".<ref name=baerp240/><ref name=perfect/> Seeing the human body as being undergirded by a "quantum mechanical body" comprised not of matter but of energy and information, he believes that "human aging is fluid and changeable; it can speed up, slow down, stop for a time, and even reverse itself," as determined by one's state of mind.<ref name=baerp240/><ref name=ageless/> He claims that his practices can also treat chronic disease.<ref name=aids /><ref name=AshmanBarringer2005 /><!--TODO: expand this summary-->

=== Consciousness ===
Chopra speaks and writes regularly about [[metaphysics]], including the study of consciousness and [[Vedanta]] philosophy. He is a philosophical [[Idealism|idealist]], arguing for the primacy of consciousness over matter and for [[teleology]] and intelligence in nature{{Snd}} that mind, or "dynamically active consciousness", is a fundamental feature of the universe.<ref>Deepak Chopra, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scI9ZFImN8o "What Is Consciousness & Where Is It?"], discussion with [[Rudolph E.

In this view, consciousness is both subject and object.<ref>Deepak Chopra, [[Stuart Hameroff]], "The 'Quantum Soul': A Scientific Hypothesis," in Alexander Moreira-Almeida, Franklin Santana Santos (eds.), ''Exploring Frontiers of the Mind-Brain Relationship'', Springer, 2011 (pp.&nbsp;79–93), p. 85.</ref> It is consciousness, he writes, that creates reality; we are not "physical machines that have somehow learned to think...[but] thoughts that have learned to create a physical machine".<ref name=quantum/> He argues that the evolution of species is the evolution of consciousness seeking to express itself as multiple observers; the universe experiences itself through our brains: "We are the eyes of the universe looking at itself".<ref>Deepak Chopra, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4c_CrQzUGw "Dangerous Ideas: Deepak Chopra & Richard Dawkins"], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522014546/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4c_CrQzUGw |date=May 22, 2014 }} University of Puebla, November 9, 2013, 26:23 mins.

=== Approach to health care {{anchor|Quantum healing}}===
[[File:Deepak Chopra 2006 C.jpg|thumb|Deepak Chopra at a book signing in 2006]]
Chopra argues that everything that happens in the mind and brain is physically represented elsewhere in the body, with mental states (thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and memories) directly influencing [[Human body#Physiology|physiology]] by means of [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[dopamine]], [[oxytocin]], and [[serotonin]]. He has stated, "Your mind, your body and your consciousness{{Snd}} which is your spirit{{Snd}} and your social interactions, your personal relationships, your environment, how you deal with the environment, and your biology are all inextricably woven into a single process … By influencing one, you influence everything."<ref>Deepak Chopra, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0IOf08pTRc "Deepak Chopra Meditation"], courtesy of YouTube, December 10, 2012.</ref>

In discussing health care, Chopra has used the term "quantum healing", which he defined in ''Quantum Healing'' (1989) as the "ability of one mode of consciousness (the mind) to spontaneously correct the mistakes in another mode of consciousness (the body)".<ref>Chopra 2009 [1989], pp. 15, 241; Deepak Chopra, [https://www.chopra.com/ccl/healing-wisdom "Healing wisdom"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521041812/https://www.chopra.com/ccl/healing-wisdom |date=May 21, 2014 }}, The Chopra Center, June 12, 2013.
* That he uses the term "quantum healing" as a metaphor, see Richard Dawkins, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsH1U7zSp7k "Interview with Chopra"], ''The Enemies of Reason'', [http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-enemies-of-reason Channel 4 (UK)], 2007, 01:16 mins.</ref> This attempted to wed the Maharishi's version of Ayurvedic medicine with concepts from physics, an example of what cultural historian Kenneth Zysk called "New Age Ayurveda".<ref>[[Suzanne Newcombe]], "Ayurvedic Medicine in Britain and the Epistemology of Practicing Medicine in Good Faith," in Smith and Wujastyk 2008, pp. 263–264; Kenneth Zysk, "New Age Ayurveda or what happens to Indian medicine when it comes to America," ''Traditional South Asian Medicine'', 6, 2001, pp. 10–26.

Chopra coined the term ''quantum healing'' to invoke the idea of a process whereby a person's health "imbalance" is corrected by [[quantum mechanical]] means. Chopra said that quantum phenomena are responsible for health and wellbeing. He has attempted to integrate [[Ayurveda]], a traditional Indian system of medicine, with quantum mechanics, in order to justify his teachings. According to [[Robert Todd Carroll|Robert Carroll]], he "charges $25,000 per lecture performance, where he spouts a few platitudes and gives spiritual advice while warning against the ill effects of materialism".<ref name="skepdic-web" />

Chopra has equated [[spontaneous remission]] in cancer to a change in quantum state, corresponding to a jump to "a new [[level of consciousness]] that prohibits the existence of cancer". Physics professor [[Robert L. Park]] has written that physicists "wince" at the "New Age quackery" in Chopra's cancer theories, and characterizes them as a cruel fiction, since adopting them in place of effective treatment risks compounding the ill effects of the disease with guilt, and might rule out the prospect of getting a genuine cure.<ref name=AshmanBarringer2005>{{cite book|editor1-first=Keith|editor1-last=Ashman|editor2-first=Phillip|editor2-last=Barringer|title=After the Science Wars: Science and the Study of Science|chapter=Chapter 9: Voodoo medicine in a scientific world|first=Robert L|last=Park|author-link=Robert L.

Chopra's claims of quantum healing have attracted controversy due to what has been described as a "systematic misinterpretation" of modern [[physics]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Cox |first=Brian |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/02/20/why-quantum-theory-is-so-misunderstood/ |title=Why Quantum Theory Is So Misunderstood{{Snd}} Speakeasy |work=The Wall Street Journal|date=February 20, 2012 |access-date=December 15, 2012}}</ref> Chopra's connections between quantum mechanics and alternative medicine are widely regarded in the scientific community as being invalid. The main criticism revolves around the fact that [[macroscopic]] objects are too large to exhibit inherently quantum properties like [[quantum interference|interference]] and [[wave function collapse]].

Chopra has metaphorically described the AIDS virus as emitting "a sound that lures the DNA to its destruction". The condition can be treated, according to Chopra, with "Ayurveda's primordial sound".<ref name=aids /> Taking issue with this view, medical professor Lawrence Schneiderman has said that ethical issues are raised when alternative medicine is not based on empirical evidence and that, "to put it mildly, Dr. Chopra proposes a treatment and prevention program for AIDS that has no supporting empirical data".<ref name=aids>{{cite journal|pmid=12964263|year=2003|last1=Schneiderman|first1=LJ|s2cid=43786245|title=The (alternative) medicalization of life|volume=31|issue=2|pages=191–7|journal=Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics |doi=10.1111/j.1748-720X.2003.tb00080.x}}</ref>

=== Spirituality and religion ===
Chopra has likened the universe to a "reality sandwich" which has three layers: the "material" world, a "quantum" zone of matter and energy, and a "virtual" zone outside of time and space, which is the domain of God, and from which God can direct the other layers. Chopra has written that human beings' brains are "hardwired to know God" and that the functions of the [[human nervous system]] mirror divine experience.<ref name=god>{{cite journal |title=God as best seller: Deepak Chopra, Neal Walsch and New Age theology |author=Lois Malcolm |journal=The Christian Century |volume=120 |issue=19 |year=2003 |page=31}} ''commenting on'' {{cite book|author=Deepak Chopra|title=How To Know God|year= 2008|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4090-2220-6}}</ref> Chopra has written that his thinking has been inspired by [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], a 20th-century speaker and writer on philosophical and spiritual subjects.<ref>{{cite book | title=Krishnamurti: 100 Years | last=Blau | first=Evelyne | page=[https://archive.org/details/krishnamurti100y00blau/page/233 233] | publisher=Stewart, Tabori, & Chang | year= 1995 | isbn=978-1-55670-407-9 | url=https://archive.org/details/krishnamurti100y00blau/page/233 }}</ref>

In 2012, reviewing ''[[War of the Worldviews]]''{{snds}}a book co-authored by Chopra and [[Leonard Mlodinow]]&nbsp;– physics professor Mark Alford says that the work is set out as a debate between the two authors, "[covering] all the big questions: cosmology, life and evolution, the mind and brain, and God". Alford considers the two sides of the debate a false opposition, and says that "the counterpoint to Chopra's speculations is not science, with its complicated structure of facts, theories, and hypotheses," but rather [[Occam's razor]].<ref name="Alford">{{cite journal|title=Is science the antidote to Deepak Chopra's spirituality? |first=Mark |last=Alford |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=36 |issue=3 |year=2012 |page=54 |url=http://alford.fastmail.us/Chopra_Mlodinow_SI.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105184137/http://alford.fastmail.us/Chopra_Mlodinow_SI.html |archive-date=November 5, 2012 }}</ref>

In August 2005, Chopra wrote a series of articles on the [[creation–evolution controversy]] and [[Intelligent design]], which were criticized by science writer [[Michael Shermer]], founder of [[The Skeptics Society]].<ref name="ChopEin">{{cite news | last=Chopra | first=Deepak | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/intelligent-design-withou_b_6105.html | title=Intelligent Design Without the Bible | work=The Huffington Post | date=August 23, 2005|access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last= Shermer | first= Michael | url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-shermer/skyhooks-and-cranes-deep_b_6179.html | title=Skyhooks and Cranes: Deepak Chopra, George W.

=== Position on skepticism ===
[[Paul Kurtz]], an American [[Scientific skepticism|skeptic]] and [[Secular humanism|secular humanist]], has written that the popularity of Chopra's views is associated with increasing anti-scientific attitudes in society, and such popularity represents an assault on the objectivity of science itself by seeking new, alternative forms of validation for ideas. Kurtz says that medical claims must always be submitted to open-minded but proper scrutiny, and that skepticism "has its work cut out for it".<ref name=kurtz>{{cite book|author=Paul Kurtz|title=Skepticism and Humanism: The New Paradigm|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q34zdaoq0xIC&pg=PA110|year=2001|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3411-7|page=110|author-link=Paul Kurtz|access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref>

In 2013, Chopra published an article on what he saw as "skepticism" at work in Wikipedia, arguing that a "stubborn band of militant skeptics" were editing articles to prevent what he believes would be a fair representation of the views of such figures as [[Rupert Sheldrake]], an author, lecturer, and researcher in [[parapsychology]]. The result, Chopra argued, was that the encyclopedia's readers were denied the opportunity to read of attempts to "expand science beyond its conventional boundaries".<ref name=coyne>{{cite journal|first=Jerry A|last=Coyne|author-link=Jerry Coyne|title=Pseudoscientist Rupert Sheldrake Is Not Being Persecuted, And Is Not Like Galileo|journal=[[The New Republic]]|date=November 8, 2013|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/115533/rupert-sheldrake-fools-bbc-deepak-chopra}}</ref> The biologist [[Jerry Coyne]] responded, saying that it was instead Chopra who was losing out as his views were being "exposed as a lot of scientifically-sounding [[psychobabble]]".<ref name=coyne />

More broadly, Chopra has attacked skepticism as a whole, writing in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' that "No skeptic, to my knowledge, ever made a major scientific discovery or advanced the welfare of others."<ref name=perils>{{cite web |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |first=Deepak |last=Chopra |title=The Perils of Skepticism |date=November 30, 2009|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deepak-chopra/the-perils-of-skepticism_b_373788.html |access-date=April 25, 2016}}</ref> Astronomer [[Phil Plait]] said this statement trembled "on the very edge of being a blatant and gross lie", listing [[Carl Sagan]], [[Richard Feynman]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]], and [[Edward Jenner]] among the "thousands of scientists [who] are skeptics", who he said were counterexamples to Chopra's statement.<ref name=plait>{{cite journal |title=Deepak Chopra: redefining 'wrong' |author-link=Phil Plait |first=Phil |last=Plait |date=December 1, 2009 |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/12/01/deepak-chopra-redefining-wrong/ |journal=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]] }}</ref>

=== Misuse of scientific terminology ===
{{See also|Quantum mysticism}}

Reviewing [[Susan Jacoby]]'s book, ''The Age of American Unreason'', [[Wendy Kaminer]] sees Chopra's popular reception in the US as being symptomatic of many Americans' historical inability (as Jacoby puts it) "to distinguish between real scientists and those who peddled theories in the guise of science". Chopra's "nonsensical references to quantum physics" are placed in a lineage of American religious [[pseudoscience]], extending back through [[Scientology]] to [[Christian Science]].<ref name=jaco>{{cite journal| title=The Corrosion of the American Mind (reviewing ''The Age of American Unreason'' by Susan Jacoby)| first=Wendy| last=Kaminer| author-link=Wendy Kaminer| journal=The Wilson Quarterly| volume=32

Chopra has been criticized for his frequent references to the relationship of [[quantum mechanics]] to [[healing]] processes, a connection that has drawn skepticism from physicists who say it can be considered as contributing to the general confusion in the popular press regarding [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement]], [[decoherence]] and the [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] [[uncertainty principle]].<ref name=csi>{{cite journal| last=Stenger | first=Victor J|author-link=Victor J.

In April 2010, [[Aseem Shukla]], co-founder of the [[Hindu American Foundation]], criticized Chopra for suggesting that [[yoga]] did not have its origins in [[Hinduism]] but in an older Indian spiritual tradition.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shukla |first=Aseem |url=http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/aseem_shukla/2010/04/dr_chopra_honor_thy_heritage.html |title=April 28, 2010 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=February 18, 2011}}</ref> Chopra later said that yoga was rooted in "consciousness alone" expounded by Vedic [[rishi]]s long before historic Hinduism ever arose. He said that Shukla had a "fundamentalist agenda".
