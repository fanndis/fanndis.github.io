The '''electoral history of Nancy Pelosi''' spans more than three decades, from the mid-1980s to the present. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the [[United States]], [[Nancy Pelosi]] was first elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in a [[1987 United States House of Representatives elections|1987 special election]] after the death that February of Congresswoman [[Sala Burton]]. In the Democratic [[Primary election|primary]], Pelosi defeated San Francisco Supervisor [[Harry Britt]], considered the more progressive candidate, with 36 percent of the vote to his 32 percent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/nancy-pelosi-ocasio-cortez-house-speaker/ |last=Nichols |first=John |title=If Nancy Pelosi Is the Most Progressive Candidate, She Should Be the Next Speaker |work=The Nation |date=November 20, 2018 |accessdate=January 30, 2019}}</ref> In the subsequent runoff she defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Harriet Ross, her closest competitor, by more than a 2–1 margin.<ref>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Pelosi Wins Easily in S.F. Congress Race |date=June 3, 1987 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-03/news/mn-2741_1_longtime-democratic-party-activist |accessdate=January 30, 2019}}</ref>

Now in her 17th two-year term, Pelosi has enjoyed overwhelming voter support throughout her congressional career. Since 2013 she has represented {{ushr|CA|12}}, which consists of four-fifths of the [[San Francisco|city and county of San Francisco]]. She initially represented the {{ushr|CA|5|c}} (1987–1993), and then, when district boundaries were [[redistricting|redrawn]] after the [[1990 United States Census|1990 Census]], the {{ushr|CA|8|c}} (1993–2013). As the [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Democratic Party leader]] since 2003, she has sought election to the office of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] every two years since that time.
