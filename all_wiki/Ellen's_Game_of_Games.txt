===Preliminary games===
{{example farm|section|date=March 2019}}
Most of the games listed have been a part of the series since the first season of the show unless otherwise specified in the description. Games like "Make it Rain" and "Tuba Toothpaste" were later replaced.

* '''Aw Snap!''': Two Contestants are connected to a [[bungee cord]] and a stand with 5 apples in front of them. One contestants gets the green apples, while the other gets red apples. First contestant to grab all 5 apples and return them to their basket wins.
* '''Blindfolded Musical Chairs''': Five contestants are chosen to play this game and are blindfolded. The contestants dance around until the music stops and must find a randomly placed stool to sit on to stay in the game. Ellen will press a button to determine where the chairs will appear on the dancefloor. As in [[musical chairs]], the contestant who is unable to seat themselves is eliminated. After four rounds, the last contestant to survive the round advances to play Know or Go.
* '''Buckin' Blasters (Season 3)''': Two contestants mount giant cannons and must shoot their opponent’s three portraits to win. While the contestants control when to fire the cannon, Ellen will control the cannons from her podium to mess with their aiming ability. When a contestant’s portrait is hit, their cannon will spin like crazy. The first contestant who shoots all three of their opponent's portraits advances to Know or Go. If time runs out, the contestant who shoots more of their opponent's portraits wins. If there is a tie, a sudden death round is played, in which the portraits are reset, and the first contestant to shoot one of their opponent's portraits wins.
*'''Burst of Knowledge (Season 4)''': In this game, three contestants stand around a triangular platform as a balloon being filled with air is passed among them. DeGeneres will ask a question to the players and if they're correct, they will pass the balloon on to the next person in line. The contestant who is in possession of the balloon as it pops will be eliminated. 
* '''Danger Word''': Similar to the game show ''[[Password (American game show)|Password]]'', played with two teams of two. One person on each team is shown a "winning word"; they alternate giving clues to their partners. A team earns a strike (and a spray from a cannon) if the opposing team guesses correctly or if they guess a "danger word" related to the winning word.  A team with three strikes is eliminated, and one member of the winning team advances. In Season 3, Episode 1 Ellen and tWitch become the partners for two audience members. 
* '''Dirty Laundry (Season 3)''': In this game which debuted in Season 3, two teams of two are conjoined inside of a huge shirt and are given three clues to what the host is describing. The teams then must grab their color corresponding ball and throw it into the giant washing machine. The first team to do so gets the choice of either answering the question or passing it to the other team. The first team that gets three points wins the game and must choose one player to advance to play Know or Go. A simular game debuted on the Australian version of the show, except that there are questions in this.
* '''Dizzy Dash''': Contestants are asked a trivia question. They are then spun around in chairs and must run to a podium and grab a ball from it before they can answer. The first to correctly answer three questions advances to play Know or Go. In the Christmas special, this game is also known as "Dizzy Dasher".
* '''Don't Leave Me Hanging''': Three contestants are suspended in harnesses and take turns naming things which fit a given category, receiving a strike if they give an incorrect answer, repeat an answer previously given or take too long to respond. A contestant with three strikes is eliminated and launched to the top of the studio.
* '''Great Taj Mah Wall (Season 3-4)''': Slightly similar to Don't Leave Me Hanging and Five Second Rule, five contestants are strapped behind 5 walls. Ellen will then reveal a picture with many images for about 10 seconds. Then each player randomly takes turns saying an image in the picture. However, if a player says an incorrect image or an image already said, or takes too long, they will be eliminated and blasted through the walls.
* '''In Your Face, Honey (Season 1)''': Two teams of couples compete. One member from each team of two attempts to throw a ball as close to a target as possible. Each team have two attempts, the team with the most points decides who will advance. 
*'''Knockin' Boots (Season 2-3)''': A similar game to Don't Leave Me Hanging and also Song Association - Elle, where contestants answer questions about songs with one primary word. If Ellen does not believe the song has the word either in the title or in the song, the contestant gets a strike. Three strikes and then they will face being kicked by the boot above them. In Season 3, The musical artists standing with Ellen and Twitch to play a game.
* '''Make It Rain (Season 1 and 4)''': Two contestants answer trivia questions for turns at pulling down an umbrella. Several umbrellas are filled with water; one has a $10,000 cash prize and the right to advance. This game does not appear in seasons 2-3, but it came back in season 4. In season 4, the cash prize is $5,000.
* '''Master Blaster (Season 1)''': Three contestants on harnesses have to compete to solve a jigsaw-style puzzle. The losing contestants are "blasted" into the air. 
* '''Mazed & Confused (Season 3-4)''': Two players are sent into a giant mirror maze and must find their color corresponding orb, then bring it back to the original exit and place it upon a podium, while trying to avoid several traps and scares along the way. If a player exits through the incorrect door, they need to go back inside and exit through their correct exit point. First player to complete the task will advance to Know or Go.
* '''Mt. Saint Ellen (Season 2-4)''': Three contestants climb a mountain which tilts and shakes, and some climbing ropes are not attached. The first contestant to collect three diamonds advances.
*'''Name Dropper (Season 4):''' Slightly similar to See Ya Later Alligator, three contestants are strapped on an indoor roller coaster, then Ellen reads text messages from one of her celebrity friends. The contestants have to guess who that celebrity is. If the contestant guesses correctly, they pick who to send up the track, but if they guess incorrectly they'll get sent up the track, and if a contestant already reaches the maximum height of the ride they'll be eliminated and dropped from the top of the ride.
* '''Oh Ship! (Season 2-4)''': Contestants are asked multiple-choice questions and race to holes corresponding to the choices. Incorrect holes spray water in the players' faces. The first to collect three correct answers advances. In episode 12 of Season 3, a female contestant named Jazmine won Oh Ship!, breaking the men’s winning streak.
* '''One-Eyed Monster (Season 1-2)''': Contestants standing inside the jaws of a giant prop monster must pull its removable teeth for wrong answers; one tooth will cause the jaws to close, eliminating the contestant. If the contestant answered incorrectly, they had to pull as many teeth as the margin of error. A correct answer ended the turn without pulling any teeth. In season 2, the contestant in control predicts how many of 100 audience members said yes to a survey question, and the opponent guesses whether the actual number was higher or lower (similar to the game show ''[[Card Sharks]]''). A correct high/low guess sends the contestant in control to the jaws, while a miss sends the opponent instead.
*'''Runaway Bride''' '''(Season 3)''': Slightly similar to Mt. Saint Ellen, the players are in dresses and are on a treadmill trying to stay on the treadmill while getting 3 slices of cake onto their plate. Obstacles like a bell and two spinners will get in their way, and there’ll be slices of sandwiches and cheese flying at them as well, and whoever gets 3 cakes first advances.
* '''Say Whaaat?''': Two teams will wear headphones with loud music. They must relay a message using [[lip reading]], earning points based on the number of words in their answer compared to the original phrase. The team with the most points chooses one member to advance  if both teams get the same number of words correct,  they must do it again. The game is based on [[Chinese whispers|Telephone/Chinese Whispers]].
* '''Scary-Go-Round (Season 1-2)''': Contestants take turns moving three large balls across a series of rotating platforms while their opponent launches balls to impede them. The contestant with the fastest time advances. If the contestants finish it in the same amount of time, they must do it again. From season 2, the game is played with teams of two.
* '''See Ya Later, Alligator (Season 2-4)''': Four players are shown pictograms; the first to correctly state the phrase they make up gets to eliminate an opponent. The last person left advances.
* '''Son of a One-Eyed Monster (Season 2-3)''': Slightly similar to Make it Rain!, the host reads a list of words and the first contestant to correctly state what they have in common gets to choose one of eight giant eggs. One of the eggs allows the contestant to advance; the others spew slime on the contestant. An incorrect guess allows the opponent to hear two more words before guessing.
* '''Stink Tank (Season 2-4)''': Similar to You Bet Your Wife, but the roles are reversed. (Those standing with DeGeneres will be providing the answers while those above the pit of slime will conduct the bidding.) In Season 3, The celebrities who are standing with the host answer.
* '''Taste Buds (Season 2-3)''': Two teams of two are blindfolded with arms interlocked, and take turns tasting food and describing it to their teammate. Whichever team can guess more items correctly in a certain amount of time chooses one member to advance.
* '''Tuba Toothpaste (Season 1)''': Answering a trivia question incorrectly requires a contestant to press up to 3 of 10 buttons that resemble tuba valves. One button blasts toothpaste into the contestant's face and eliminates them. This game does not appear in season 2 or 3.
* '''You Bet Your Wife''': Normally played with two players to compete. One player will be hooked into a harness above a pool of food while one player  to represent their team as bidders. The bidders will be given a topic question and asked how many items of that topic can their partner in the harness give. In alternating fashion, the bidders will give their guess as to how many items corresponding to the list can their partner name. The opposing team bidder will either counter that bid with a higher bid or challenge the prior team to give that many correct answers. The players in the will be allotted 30 seconds to give the challenged number of answers. First team to be dunked three times will lose. 

=== '''Final Games''' ===

===Know or Go===
The winners of the four preliminary games stand on a row of trap doors, and take turns answering questions. An incorrect answer results in the contestant being eliminated from the game and dropped through the trap door, sliding down a chute that empties below the stage. The last contestant standing advances to the final game for up to $100,000.

Beginning with Season 2, the game shifts to "Sudden Drop" rules when two contestants remain. If one contestant misses their question, the other must answer it correctly in a tiebreaker in order to advance to Hot Hands. If both contestants miss the same question, the game continues until one gets the tiebreaker question right.

===Hot Hands (Season 1-3)===
The contestant has 30 seconds to identify the faces of ten celebrities that fit a certain category. After identifying a celebrity, the contestant must press a button to move on to the next face. Contestants may pass if they are unsure but will need to wait three seconds until the next face appears. Contestants earn an escalating amount of money based on the number of faces they correctly identify, as shown in the table below. Correctly identifying ten celebrities earns the grand prize of $100,000. From season&nbsp;2, the contestants choose their preferred category from amongst three options, where the third one is always the most specific, difficult and humorous which no one chooses . This game does not appear in season 4
