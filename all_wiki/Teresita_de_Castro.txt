==The trial of Joseph Estrada==
{{main|Trial of Joseph Estrada}}

De Castro headed the anti-graft court's special division on the perjury and plunder trial of former President [[Joseph Estrada]]. Estrada's son, Senator [[Jinggoy Estrada]] also faced charges. The trial finished in September 2007. Estrada was acquitted of perjury charges but found guilty of plunder and sentenced to life imprisonment.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/sandiganbayandecision.html GMA NEWS.TV, The SANDIGANBAYAN DECISION]</ref> All the co-defendants, including Senator Jinggoy Estrada, were acquitted of all charges.

Estrada appealed the decision<ref>[http://news.monstersandcritics.com/asiapacific/news/article_1359793.php/Philippines_ex-president_Estrada_appeals_conviction_for_plunder  Monstersandcritics.com, Philippines' ex-president Estrada appeals conviction for plunder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207190457/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/asiapacific/news/article_1359793.php/Philippines_ex-president_Estrada_appeals_conviction_for_plunder |date=2012-02-07 }}</ref> and called the court (and De Castro, as head of it) "a kangaroo court", while President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] said the court's decision must be accepted.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSMNT00044820070912  Reuters, Philippines' Estrada gets life]</ref>

De Castro was appointed to the Supreme Court soon after the end of the highly-politicized trial. This led to some accusations of ''[[quid pro quo]]''. People claimed that she had convicted former President Estrada in exchange for a seat on the Supreme Court.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/60521/Palace-urges-Sandigan-justices-to-decline-SC-nomination  GMA NEWS.TV, Palace urges Sandigan justices to decline SC nomination]</ref> She vigorously denied those rumors, claiming that she had been a candidate for a seat on the high court before her involvement in the case.

==Appointment to the Supreme Court==
[[File:Leonardojf.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Chambers (law)|Chambers]] of  Teresita Leonardo-De Castro  (new [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] building).]]
On October 16, 2007, the [[Judicial and Bar Council]] (JBC) announced the final nominees to the Associate Justice [[Cancio Garcia]]'s vacant [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] Associate Justice post. Teresita De Castro, Justices Edgardo Cruz and [[Martin Villarama]], got 7 out of 8 votes, while Associate Justices Francisco Villaruz and Edilberto G. Sandoval and Labor Secretary [[Arturo D. Brion]] got 5 votes each (from the JBC). Under Philippine law, the President has 90 days to choose from among the final nominees.<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=94732  Inquirer.net, Sandiganbayan, 2 CA justices lead nominees for SC post] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222020451/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=94732 |date=2008-02-22 }}</ref>

Senator [[Jinggoy Estrada]] (son of Joseph), vowed to block the appointment to the Supreme Court of Sandiganbayan Justices Teresita de Castro and Francisco Villaruz, Jr. (who convicted his father – President [[Joseph Estrada]]). Jinggoy argued that: "''Such a promotion would seem like a reward in exchange for the guilty verdict against the deposed President. We are convinced, then and now, that the special court created to exclusively try the case of President Estrada was established precisely to convict him, which is what exactly happened''."<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/67275/Jinggoy-vows-to-block-Sandigan-justices-appointment-to-SC  gmanews.tv,  Jinggoy vows to block Sandigan justices' appointment to SC]</ref>

De Castro was sworn before Chief Justice [[Reynato S. Puno]] on December 4, 2007.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/71177/New-SC-CA-justices-to-be-sworn-in-Tuesday  GmaNews.tv, New SC, CA justices to be sworn in Tuesday]</ref> Teresita de Castro stated: "Everything happens in God's time. I believe that my 34 years of service in the judiciary and a good track record make me qualified for this position."  Immediately after being sworn in, she participated in her first en banc session.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070709212017/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=101338  AbsCbn, De Castro takes oath of office]</ref>

De Castro became controversial when she was the Sandiganbayan's Presiding Justice after her Division convicted former President [[Joseph Estrada]] for graft. Many believed that her decision was related to her subsequent appointment by former President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] as the 160th Associate Justice of the Supreme Court in 2007 in exchange of her favorable decision.

===Reactions to her appointment to the Supreme Court===
* [[Joseph Estrada]] called the appointment of Teresita de Castro as a "reward for an unjust conviction [of him]".<ref>[http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/man/2007/12/05/news/de.castro.s.appointment.to.sc.a.political.reward.erap.html  Sun Star,  De Castro's appointment to SC a political reward: Erap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511174553/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/man/2007/12/05/news/de.castro.s.appointment.to.sc.a.political.reward.erap.html |date=2008-05-11 }}</ref>
* Sen. [[Francis Pangilinan]] questioned de Castro's appointment in light of her impending retirement on October 8, saying it "does not help in the strengthening of the rule of law."<ref>[https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/08/25/18/government-officials-react-to-de-castros-appointment-as-chief-justice  ABS-CBN,  Government officials react to De Castro’s appointment as chief justice]</ref>
* Former [[Solicitor General of the Philippines|Solicitor General]] [[Florin Hilbay]] and opposition lawmaker Gary Alejano said that de Castro's appointment may be considered as the President's way of paying his debt of gratitude to the second most senior magistrate of the high court.<ref>[https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/08/25/18/government-officials-react-to-de-castros-appointment-as-chief-justice  ABS-CBN,  Government officials react to De Castro’s appointment as chief justice]</ref>
* Minority Leader [[Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.]] said: "That is the President's call and I do not question it. Of course, other persons may have personal reasons for objecting to the appointment of Justice De Castro. But you cannot please everyone."<ref>[http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=politics2_dec5_2007  Manila Standard Today,  Estradas slam De Castro’s promotion]</ref>
* On December 4, 2007, Senate President [[Manuel Villar]] and Senate President Pro-Tempore [[Jinggoy Estrada]] (the son of Joseph) questioned the timing of de Castro's appointment. Villar stated that: "The appointment coming so soon after de Castro's Division had convicted former President Joseph Estrada is bad timing. It gives the impression that it was her reward for convicting Erap [Estrada's nickname]."  Jinggoy Estrada said: "A few months after the conviction of President Estrada, she [de Castro] was immediately appointed to the Supreme Court. I think there was a deal between Malacañang and Sandiganbayan that if she convicts Estrada, she would be appointed to the Supreme Court. That gave political color to the decision of Sandiganbayan. I think she is qualified to be an associate justice. It's just that the timing is wrong. If I were Justice de Castro, I would have refused the appointment out of delicadeza [good taste]. It did not look good in the eyes of the public."
* Sen. [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]] stated that "de Castro is highly qualified for the High Tribunal and that her appointment could not be interpreted as "reward" for her decision on the Erap plunder case. Malacañang had ignored the Sandiganbayan's guilty verdict and granted absolute pardon to the former president."<ref>[http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/dec/05/yehey/top_stories/20071205top2.html  Manila Times,  Villar, Jinggoy hit timing of SC appointment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205054823/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/dec/05/yehey/top_stories/20071205top2.html |date=2007-12-05 }}</ref>
* Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita defended the appointment of Teresita de Castro noting that she was nominated several times to the post but because she was still handling the Estrada case she was bypassed twice. He added that de Castro deserved the appointment.<ref>[https://archive.is/20070709212017/http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=101467  AbsCbn, Ermita defends de Castro's appointment]</ref>

===Testimony against Sereno===
De Castro was one of five sitting justices who sought to nullify the appointment of [[Maria Lourdes Sereno]] as the country's top magistrate. De Castro and Sereno were both shortlisted by the Judicial and Bar Council in 2012 for the Chief Justiceship but then-President [[Benigno Aquino III]] appointed the latter to the post. Along with four other members, she was accused of exhausting legal remedies to oust the incumbent Chief Justice.

==Chief Justice==
On August 25, 2018, De Castro was appointed by President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] as the [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice of the Supreme Court]], following the ouster of [[Maria Lourdes Sereno]] via ''[[Quo warranto petition against Maria Lourdes Sereno|quo warranto]]''. She served 46 days until her mandatory retirement on her 70th birthday on 10 October. De Castro's appointment was criticized due to her expected short term of two months since she is obligated to retire on October 8, 2018, as well as her role as one of the five sitting justices who sought to nullify the appointment of Sereno as Chief Justice.<ref>https://www.rappler.com/nation/210284-teresita-de-castro-supreme-court-chief-justice</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Teresita Leonardo de Castro is new Chief Justice|url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/08/25/Chief-Justice-Teresita-Leonardo-de-Castro.html|work=CNN Philippines|date=August 25, 2018|accessdate=August 25, 2018}} </ref>
