It extends from the [[Baltic Sea]] in the west to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the east, and from the [[Arctic Ocean]] in the north to the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] in the south. Russia covers over {{convert|17125200|km2|mi2}}, spanning more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, stretching [[Time in Russia|eleven time zones]], and [[Borders of Russia|bordering 16 sovereign nations]]. [[Moscow]] is the country's capital and largest city, other major [[List of cities and towns in Russia by population|cities]] include [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Kazan]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Chelyabinsk]] and [[Samara]].

Russia is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|largest country in the world]], the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|ninth-most populous country]], as well as the [[List of European countries by population|most populous country]] in Europe. The country is one of the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|most sparsely populated]] and [[Urbanization by country|urbanized]]. About half of the country's total area is [[European countries by forest area|forested]], concentrating around four-fifths of its total population of over 146.7 million on its smaller and dense [[European Russia|western portion]], as opposed to its larger and sparse [[Siberia|eastern portion]]. Russia is administratively divided into [[Federal subjects of Russia|85 federal subjects]]. The [[Moscow metropolitan area|Moscow Metropolitan Area]] is the [[List of metropolitan areas in Europe|largest metropolitan area]] in Europe, and [[List of largest cities|among the largest in the world]], with more than 20 million residents.

The [[East Slavs]] emerged as a recognisable group in Europe between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. The [[medieval]] state of [[Rus (state)|Rus']] arose in the 9th century. In 988 it adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]], beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined [[Russian culture]] for the next millennium. Rus' ultimately disintegrated into a number of smaller states, until it was finally reunified by the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] in the 15th century. By the 18th century, the nation had greatly expanded through conquest, annexation, and [[Russian explorers|exploration]] to become the [[Russian Empire]], which became a major European power, and the [[List of largest empires|third-largest empire]] in history. Following the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] became the largest and leading constituent of the [[Soviet Union]], the world's first constitutionally [[socialist state]]. The Soviet Union played a [[Eastern Front (World War II)|decisive role]] in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in [[World War II]], and emerged as a [[superpower]] and rival to the [[United States]] during the [[Cold War]]. The Soviet era saw some of the [[Timeline of Russian inventions and technology records|most significant technological achievements]] of the 20th century, including the world's [[Sputnik|first human-made satellite]] and the launching of the [[Yuri Gagarin|first humans in space]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] reconstituted itself as the Russian Federation and is recognised as the continuing legal personality and a successor of the Soviet Union. Following the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis of 1993]], a new [[Constitution of Russia|constitution]] was adopted, and Russia has since been governed as a [[federation|federal]] [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] republic.

Russia is described as a [[Potential superpowers|potential superpower]], with the world's [[Military#Capability development|second-most powerful military]], and the [[List of countries by military expenditure|fourth-highest military expenditure]]. As a [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|recognised]] [[nuclear weapons states|nuclear-weapon state]], the country possesses the world's [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|largest stockpile of nuclear weapons]]. Its [[Economy of Russia|economy]] ranks as the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|eleventh-largest in the world by nominal GDP]] and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|sixth-largest by PPP]]. Russia's extensive mineral and energy resources are the largest such reserves in the world, making it one of the leading [[oil producer|producers of oil]] and [[natural gas producer|natural gas]] globally. Russia hosts the world's [[List of World Heritage Sites in Russia|ninth-greatest number]] of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]], and is simultaneously ranked very high in the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]], has a [[Healthcare in Russia|universal healthcare system]] and a [[Free education|free]] [[Education in Russia|university education]].

==Etymology==<!-- linked -->
{{Main|Rus' people|Rus' (name)}}
{{See also|Russian (disambiguation)}}
The name ''Russia'' is derived from [[Rus' (name)|Rus']], a medieval state populated mostly by the [[East Slavs]]. However, this proper name became more prominent in the later history, and the country typically was called by its inhabitants "Русская Земля" (''russkaja zemlja''), which can be translated as "Russian Land" or "Land of Rus'". In order to distinguish this state from other states derived from it, it is denoted as ''[[Kievan Rus']]'' by modern historiography. The [[Rus (name)|name ''Rus'']] itself comes from the early medieval [[Rus' people]], [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedish]] merchants and warriors<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Russia |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=2 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/rus |title=Rus – definition of Rus by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |access-date=2 November 2011}}</ref> who relocated from across the Baltic Sea and founded a state centered on [[Novgorod]] that later became [[Kievan Rus]].

An old Latin version of the name Rus' was [[Ruthenia]], mostly applied to the western and southern regions of Rus' that were adjacent to Catholic Europe. The current name of the country, Россия (''Rossija''), comes from the [[Byzantine Greek]] designation of the [[Rus' (name)|Rus']], Ρωσσία ''Rossía''—spelled Ρωσία (''Rosía'' {{IPA-el|roˈsia|pron}}) in [[Modern Greek]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Russians: The People of Europe |last=Milner-Gulland |first=R.

The standard way to refer to citizens of Russia is "[[citizens of Russia|Russians]]" in English<ref name="merriamwebster">{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Russian|title=Definition of Russian|dictionary=Merriam-Webster|access-date=21 September 2016}}</ref> and ''rossiyane'' ({{lang-rus|россияне}}) in Russian. There are two [[Russian language|Russian]] words which are commonly translated into English as "Russians". One is "русские" (''russkiye''), which most often means "ethnic [[Russians]]". Another is "россияне" (''rossiyane''), which means "[[citizens of Russia]], regardless of ethnicity". Translations into other languages often do not distinguish these two groups.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In [[classical antiquity]], the Pontic Steppe was known as [[Scythia]].

The most powerful state to eventually arise after the destruction of Kievan Rus' was the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] ("Muscovy" in the Western chronicles), initially a part of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]]. While still under the domain of the [[Mongol]]-[[Tatars]] and with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in the Central Rus' in the early 14th century, gradually becoming the leading force in the process of the Rus' lands' reunification and expansion of Russia.<ref>Davies B.

Led by Prince [[Dmitry Donskoy]] of Moscow and helped by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the united army of Russian principalities inflicted a milestone defeat on the Mongol-Tatars in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] in 1380. Moscow gradually absorbed the surrounding principalities, including formerly strong rivals such as [[Principality of Tver|Tver]] and [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]].

[[Ivan&nbsp;III]] ("the Great") finally threw off the control of the [[Golden Horde]] and consolidated the whole of Central and Northern Rus' under Moscow's dominion. He was also the first to take the title "Grand Duke of all the Russias".<ref>{{cite web

During his long reign, Ivan the Terrible nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of the disintegrated [[Golden Horde]]): [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the [[Volga River]], and the [[Siberian Khanate]] in southwestern Siberia. Thus, by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a [[multiethnic]], [[Religious denomination|multidenominational]] and [[transcontinental state]].

However, the Tsardom was weakened by the long and unsuccessful [[Livonian War]] against the coalition of Poland, Lithuania, and Sweden for access to the Baltic coast and sea trade.<ref>{{cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=6|pages=751–908|isbn=978-5-17-002142-0}}</ref> At the same time, the Tatars of the [[Crimean Khanate]], the only remaining successor to the Golden Horde, continued to raid Southern Russia.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eizo Matsuki|url=http://www.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~areastd/mediterranean/mw/pdf/18/10.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501041101/http://www.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~areastd/mediterranean/mw/pdf/18/10.pdf|archive-date=1 May 2011|title=The Crimean Tatars and their Russian-Captive Slaves|publisher=Mediterranean Studies Group at Hitotsubashi University|access-date=4 May 2013}}</ref> In an effort to restore the Volga khanates, Crimeans and their [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] allies [[Russo-Crimean Wars|invaded central Russia]] and were even able to [[Fire of Moscow (1571)|burn down parts of Moscow]] in 1571.<ref>{{cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=6|pages=751–809|isbn=978-5-17-002142-0}}</ref> But in the next year the large invading army was thoroughly defeated by Russians in the [[Battle of Molodi]], forever eliminating the threat of an Ottoman–Crimean expansion into Russia.

In 1612, the Poles were forced to retreat by the Russian volunteer corps, led by two national heroes, merchant [[Kuzma Minin]] and Prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]]. The [[Romanov Dynasty]] acceded to the throne in 1613 by the decision of Zemsky Sobor, and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis.

Russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of [[Cossacks]]. Cossacks were warriors organised into military communities, resembling [[pirates]] and [[pioneers of the New World]]. In 1648, the peasants of Ukraine joined the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] in reaction to the social and religious oppression they had been suffering under Polish rule. In 1654, the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey&nbsp;I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)|Russo-Polish War]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the [[Dnieper River]], leaving the western part, [[right-bank Ukraine]], under Polish rule and the eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian rule. Later, in 1670–71, the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the [[Volga Region]], but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels.

In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian River Routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast. In 1648, the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by [[Fedot Popov]] and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

[[Peter the Great's reforms]] brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia.

The reign of Peter&nbsp;I's daughter [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]] in 1741–62 saw Russia's participation in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–63). During this conflict Russia annexed [[East Prussia]] for a while and even took Berlin. However, upon Elizabeth's death, all these conquests were returned to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] by pro-Prussian [[Peter&nbsp;III of Russia]].

[[Catherine the Great|Catherine&nbsp;II]] ("the Great"), who ruled in 1762–96, presided over the Age of [[Russian Enlightenment]]. She extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the [[Partitions of Poland]], pushing the Russian frontier westward into Central Europe. In the south, after successful [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] against [[Ottoman Turkey]], Catherine advanced Russia's boundary to the Black Sea, defeating the [[Crimean Khanate]]. As a result of victories over [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]] through the [[Russo-Persian Wars]], by the first half of the 19th century Russia also made significant territorial gains in [[Transcaucasia]] and the [[North Caucasus]], forcing the former to irrevocably cede what is nowadays [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Dagestan]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia]] to Russia.<ref>Timothy C.

In alliances with various European countries, Russia fought against [[Napoleon]]'s France. The [[French invasion of Russia]] at the height of Napoleon's power in 1812 reached Moscow, but eventually failed miserably as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold [[Russian winter]] led to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which more than 95% of the pan-European [[Grande Armée]] perished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ruling the Empire|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/5.htm|access-date=27 December 2007}}</ref> Led by [[Mikhail Kutuzov]] and [[Barclay de Tolly]], the Russian army ousted Napoleon from the country and drove through Europe in the [[war of the Sixth Coalition]], finally entering Paris.

At the end of the conservative reign of [[Nicolas&nbsp;I]] (1825–55), a zenith period of Russia's power and influence in Europe was disrupted by defeat in the [[Crimean War]].

Nicholas's successor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;II]] (1855–81) enacted significant changes in the country, including the [[emancipation reform of 1861]]. These ''Great Reforms'' spurred industrialization and modernised the Russian army, which had successfully liberated Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in the [[1877–78 Russo-Turkish War]].

The late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in Russia. Alexander&nbsp;II was killed in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists, and the reign of his son
[[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;III]] (1881–94) was less liberal but more peaceful. The last Russian Emperor, [[Nicholas&nbsp;II]] (1894–1917), was unable to prevent the events of the Russian [[Revolution of 1905]], triggered by the unsuccessful [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the demonstration incident known as [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]]. The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms ([[Russian Constitution of 1906]]), including granting the [[freedom of speech|freedoms of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], the legalization of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]]. The [[Stolypin reform|Stolypin agrarian reform]] led to a massive peasant migration and settlement into [[Siberia]].

In 1914, Russia entered [[World War&nbsp;I]] in response to [[Austria-Hungary]]'s declaration of war on Russia's ally [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from its [[Triple Entente]] allies. In 1916, the [[Brusilov Offensive]] of the Russian Army almost completely destroyed the military of Austria-Hungary. However, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, [[World War I casualties|high casualties]], and rumors of corruption and treason. All this formed the climate for the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, carried out in two major acts.

The [[February Revolution]] forced [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] to abdicate; he and his family were imprisoned and [[Shooting of the Romanov family|later executed in Yekaterinburg]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. The monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]].

{{Main|October Revolution|Russian Civil War|White movement}}
{{See also|Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Constitution of 1918 (disambiguation){{!}}Russian Constitution of 1918}}
An alternative socialist establishment co-existed, the [[Petrograd Soviet]], wielding power through the democratically elected councils of workers and peasants, called ''[[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]''. The rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country, instead of resolving it. Eventually, the [[October Revolution]], led by [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the Provisional Government and gave full governing power to the Soviets, leading to the creation of the world's first [[socialist state]].

Following the October Revolution, a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] broke out between the [[anti-Communist]] [[White movement]] and the new [[Workers' council|Soviet]] regime with its [[Red Army]]. Bolshevist Russia lost its Ukrainian, Polish, Baltic, and Finnish territories by signing the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] that concluded hostilities with the [[Central Powers]] of World War&nbsp;I. The [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] launched an unsuccessful [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|military intervention]] in support of anti-Communist forces. In the meantime both the Bolsheviks and White movement carried out campaigns of deportations and executions against each other, known respectively as the [[Red Terror]] and [[White Terror (Russia)|White Terror]].

The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (called ''Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic'' at the time), together with the [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian]], [[Byelorussian SSR|Byelorussian]], and [[Transcaucasian SSR|Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Republics]], [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|formed]] the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), or Soviet Union, on 30 December 1922. Out of the 15 [[republics of the USSR|republics that would make up the USSR]], the largest in size and over half of the total USSR population was the Russian SFSR, which came to dominate the union for its entire 69-year history.

Following [[Death and state funeral of Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's death]] in 1924, a [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union#List of troikas|troika]] was designated to govern the Soviet Union. However, [[Joseph Stalin]], an elected [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], managed to suppress all opposition groups within the party and consolidate power in his hands to become the Soviet Union's ''de facto'' dictator by the 1930s. [[Leon Trotsky]], the main proponent of [[world revolution]], was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929, and Stalin's idea of [[Socialism in One Country]] became the primary line. The continued internal struggle in the Bolshevik party culminated in the [[Great Purge]], a period of mass repressions in 1937–38, during which hundreds of thousands of people were executed, including [[Old Bolshevik|original party members]] and military leaders accused of [[coup d'état]] plots.<ref>Abbott Gleason (2009).

Under Stalin's leadership, the government launched a [[command economy]], [[Industrialization in the USSR|industrialization of the largely rural country]], and [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivization]] of [[Agriculture in the USSR|its agriculture]].

====World War II====
[[File:RIAN archive 44732 Soviet soldiers attack house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|The [[Battle of Stalingrad]], the largest and bloodiest battle in the history of warfare, ended in 1943 with a decisive Soviet victory.]]

The [[Appeasement]] policy of [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and [[France]] towards [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] did not stem an increase in the power of [[Nazi Germany]]. Around the same time, the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] allied with the [[Empire of Japan]], a rival of the USSR in the Far East and an open enemy of the USSR in the [[Soviet–Japanese Border Wars]] in 1938–39.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}} 

In August 1939, as attempts to form an anti-Nazi military alliance with Britain and France failed, the Soviet government signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with Nazi Germany, pledging [[Non-aggression pact|non-aggression]] between the two countries and secretly dividing Eastern Europe into their respective spheres of influence. When Germany launched the [[Invasion of Poland]], the formally neutral Soviets followed weeks later with [[Soviet Invasion of Poland|their own invasion]] of the country, claiming the eastern half of Poland. The Soviet government engaged in significant cooperation with Nazi Germany between 1939 and 1941, through extensive trade agreements which supplied Germany with vital raw materials for her war effort against Britain and France. As the other European powers were busy fighting in [[World War II]], the USSR expanded her own military, and occupied the [[Hertza region]] as a result of the [[Winter War]], [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|annexed the Baltic states]] and [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina|annexed Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]] from [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]].

The Soviet rear was also badly damaged by the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]]. [[Luftwaffe]] bombed the cities of the Soviet Union from the air. [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]] suffered the most from the [[Bombing of Gorky in World War II|bombing]]. This city was the main industrial center of the USSR and was located near the [[Moscow Defence Zone]]. The bombing of the [[Volga Military District|Volga]] capital destroyed the largest automobile plant [[GAZ]]. This plant supplied tanks for the front. Whole residential areas and other large factories of the city were destroyed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

====Cold War====
After the war, Eastern and Central Europe including [[East Germany]] and part of [[Austria]] was occupied by [[Red Army]] according to the [[Potsdam Conference]]. Dependent socialist governments were installed in the [[Eastern Bloc]] satellite states. Becoming the world's second [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons power]], the USSR established the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the [[Cold War]], with the United States and [[NATO]]. The Soviet Union supported revolutionary movements across the world, including the newly formed People's Republic of China, the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] and, later on, the [[Republic of Cuba]]. Significant amounts of Soviet resources were [[International relations within the Comecon|allocated in aid]] to the other socialist states.<ref>[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0391%29 Foreign trade] from ''A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former)''. [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] project.</ref>

After [[Stalin's death]] and a short period of [[Collective leadership|collective rule]], the new leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] denounced the [[Stalin's cult of personality|cult of personality of Stalin]] and launched the policy of [[de-Stalinization]]. The penal labor system was reformed and many prisoners were released and rehabilitated (many of them posthumously).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916205-2,00.html|work=TIME|access-date=1 August 2008|title=Great Escapes from the Gulag|date=5 June 1978}}</ref> The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. At the same time, tensions with the United States heightened when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the United States [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter missiles]] in Turkey and Soviet [[Cuban Missile Crisis|missiles in Cuba]].

[[File:Sputnik asm.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Sputnik&nbsp;1]] was the world's first artificial satellite.]]

In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik&nbsp;1]]'', thus starting the [[Space Age]]. Russia's [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human to orbit the Earth, aboard the ''[[Vostok&nbsp;1]]'' manned spacecraft on [[Cosmonautics Day|12 April 1961]].

Following the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of [[Collectivity of leadership|collective rule]] ensued, until [[Leonid Brezhnev]] became the leader. The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the [[Era of Stagnation]], a period when economic growth slowed and social policies became static. The 1965 [[Kosygin reform]] aimed for partial [[decentralization]] of the [[Soviet economy]] and shifted the emphasis from [[heavy industry]] and weapons to [[light industry]] and [[consumer goods]] but was stifled by the conservative Communist leadership.

In 1979, after a Communist-led revolution in Afghanistan, [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet forces entered]] that country. The occupation drained economic resources and dragged on without achieving meaningful political results. Ultimately, the Soviet Army was withdrawn from Afghanistan in 1989 due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.

[[File:President Reagan meeting with Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev at Hofdi House during the Reykjavik Summit Iceland.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in one-to-one discussions with US President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]
From 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring) in an attempt to end the [[Era of Stagnation|period of economic stagnation]] and to [[Demokratizatsiya (Soviet Union)|democratise the government]]. This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements. Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact90/world12.txt|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|access-date=9 March 2008|title=1990 CIA World Factbook}}</ref> but during its last years it was afflicted by shortages of goods in grocery stores, huge budget deficits, and explosive growth in the money supply leading to inflation.<ref name="photius.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/russia/economy/russia_economy_unforeseen_results_o~1315.html|title=Russia Unforeseen Results of Reform|publisher=The Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Factbook|access-date=10 March 2008}}</ref>

By 1991, economic and political turmoil began to boil over, as the [[Baltic states]] chose to secede from the Soviet Union. On 17 March, a [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum]] was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a [[Union of Sovereign States|renewed federation]]. In August 1991, [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|a coup d'état attempt]] by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On 25 December 1991, the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|USSR was dissolved]] into 15 [[post-Soviet states]].

In June 1991, [[Boris Yeltsin]] became the first directly elected president in Russian history when he was elected President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which became the independent Russian Federation in December of that year. The economic and political collapse of USSR led to a deep and prolonged depression, characterised by a 50% decline in both GDP and industrial output between 1990 and 1995, although some of the recorded declines may have been a result of an upward bias in Soviet-era economic data.<ref name=OECD /><ref>{{cite web|title=Russia: Economic Conditions in Mid-1996|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ru0119)|access-date=29 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041030123659/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+ru0119%29|archive-date=30 October 2004|url-status=live}}</ref> During and after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, wide-ranging reforms including [[Privatization in Russia|privatization]] and [[free trade|market and trade liberalization]] were undertaken,<ref name="OECD">{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/7/50/2452793.pdf|title=Russian Federation|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)|access-date=24 February 2008}}</ref> including radical changes along the lines of "[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]" as recommended by the United States and the [[International Monetary Fund]].<ref name="Sciolino, E">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/21/world/us-is-abandoning-shock-therapy-for-therussians.html|title= U.S. is abandoning 'shock therapy' for the Russians|author=Sciolino, E.|work=New York Times|access-date=20 January 2008|date=21 December 1993}}</ref>

The 1990s were plagued by armed conflicts in the [[North Caucasus]], both local ethnic skirmishes and separatist [[Islamist]] insurrections. From the time [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, an [[First Chechen War|intermittent guerrilla war]] has been fought between the rebel groups and the Russian military. [[Terrorism in Russia|Terrorist attacks against civilians]] carried out by separatists, most notably the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] and [[Beslan school siege]], caused hundreds of deaths and drew worldwide attention.

On 2 March 2008, [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was elected President of Russia while Putin became [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]]. The Constitution of Russia prohibited Putin from serving a third consecutive presidential term. Putin returned to the presidency following the [[2012 Russian presidential election|2012 presidential elections]], and Medvedev was appointed Prime Minister. This quick succession in leadership change was coined "[[tandemocracy]]" by outside media. Some critics claimed that the leadership change was superficial, and that Putin remained as the decision making force in the Russian government. Within the context of the ongoing [[Russia–Ukraine gas disputes#Cutting off supply (January 2009)|Russia–Ukraine gas dispute]] in early January 2009, Nikolai Petrov, an analyst with the [[Carnegie Moscow Center]] said: "What we see right now is the dominant role of Putin. We see him as a real head of state. ... This is not surprising. We are still living in Putin's Russia."<ref>{{Cite journal |date=November 2009 |title=ASCO Picks Top Clinical Cancer Research Advances for 2009 & Gives Recommendations for Accelerating Progress |journal=Oncology Times |volume=31 |issue=22 |pages=12 |doi=10.1097/01.cot.0000365291.64063.83 |issn=0276-2234}}</ref> Some Russian political analysts and commentators viewed the political power as truly tandem between Medvedev and Putin. Prior to the 2008 election, political scientists [[Gleb Pavlovsky]] and [[Stanislav Belkovsky]] discussed the future configuration of power. According to Mr. Pavlovsky, people would be very suited with the option of the union of Putin and Medvedev "similar to the two Consuls of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]". Belkovsky called Medvedev "President of a dream", referring to the early 1990s when people ostensibly dreamed of the time they "would live without the stranglehold of ubiquitous ideology, and a common person would become the head of the state".<ref>{{Citation|last=Symons|first=Arthur|editor1-first=Roger|editor1-last=Holdsworth|chapter=Pastel: Masks and Faces|date=1 January 1974|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781857547269|doi=10.1093/oseo/instance.00249484|title=Arthur Symons: Selected Writings}}</ref> Alleged fraud in the [[2011 Russian legislative elections|2011 parliamentary elections]] and Putin's return to the presidency in 2012 sparked [[2011-2013 Russian protests|mass protests]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16885446|title=Moscow: Thousands join pro- and anti-Putin protests|website=BBC News|date=4 February 2012}}</ref>

According to the [[Constitution of Russia]], the country is an [[asymmetric federalism|asymmetric federation]] and [[semi-presidential]] republic, wherein the President is the [[head of state]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|website=(Article 80, §&nbsp;1)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|access-date=27 December 2007}}</ref> and the [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]]. The Russian Federation is fundamentally structured as a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[representative democracy]], with the federal government composed of three branches:
* Legislative: The [[bicameral]] [[Federal Assembly of Russia]], made up of the 450-member [[State Duma]] and the 170-member [[Federation Council]], adopts [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves treaties, has the [[power of the purse]] and the power of [[impeachment]] of the President.
* Executive: The [[President of Russia|President]] is the [[Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Russian Armed Forces|Armed Forces]], can veto [[legislative bill]]s before they become law, and appoints the [[Government of Russia]] (Cabinet) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.
* [[Judiciary of Russia|Judiciary]]: The [[Constitutional Court of Russia|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of Russia|Supreme Court]] and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the Federation Council on the recommendation of the President, interpret laws and can overturn laws they deem [[unconstitutional]].

The president is elected by popular vote for a six-year term (eligible for a second term, but not for a third consecutive term).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|website=(Article 81, §&nbsp;3)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|access-date=27 December 2007}}</ref> Ministries of the government are composed of the Premier and his deputies, ministers, and selected other individuals; all are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Prime Minister (whereas the appointment of the latter requires the consent of the State Duma).

===Human rights===
{{Main|Human rights in Russia}}
Russia's [[human rights in Russia|human rights]] management has been criticised by leading democracy and human rights [[wikt:watchdog|watchdogs]], including over [[LGBT rights in Russia|LGBT rights]], [[media freedom in Russia|media freedom]], and reports about [[List of journalists killed in Russia|killed journalists]]). In particular, such organisations as [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] consider Russia to have not enough democratic attributes and to allow few political rights and civil liberties to its citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/region/russia/report-2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713010532/http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/russia/report-2009|archive-date=13 July 2010|title=Amnesty International report on Russia|publisher=Amnesty International|access-date=11 July 2010}}</ref><ref>Human Rights Watch on Russia and Chechnya [https://www.hrw.org/en/video/2008/04/06/russia-trial HTW.org]</ref> [[Freedom House]], an international organisation funded by the United States, ranks Russia as "not free", citing "carefully engineered elections" and "absence" of debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2009/russia?page=22&year=2009&country=7689#.VT7KCuH9ycw|title=Annual report Russia|publisher=Freedom House|date=10 May 2004|access-date=27 April 2010}}</ref> Russian authorities dismiss these claims and especially criticise Freedom House.

Republics are allowed to establish their own official language alongside Russian but are represented by the federal government in international affairs. Republics are meant to be home to specific ethnic minorities.
* 9 [[krais of Russia|krais]] (territories): essentially the same as oblasts. The "territory" designation is historic, originally given to frontier regions and later also to the administrative divisions that comprised autonomous okrugs or autonomous oblasts.
* 4 [[autonomous okrugs of Russia|autonomous okrugs]] (autonomous districts): originally autonomous entities within oblasts and krais created for ethnic minorities, their status was elevated to that of federal subjects in the 1990s. With the exception of [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]], all autonomous okrugs are still administratively subordinated to a krai or an oblast of which they are a part.
* 1 [[Autonomous oblasts of Russia|autonomous oblast]] (the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]]): historically, autonomous oblasts were administrative units subordinated to krais. In 1990, all of them except for the Jewish AO were elevated in status to that of a republic.
* 3 [[federal cities]] (Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg]], and [[Sevastopol]]): major cities that function as separate regions.

;Federal districts
Federal subjects are grouped into eight [[federal districts of Russia|federal districts]], each administered by an envoy appointed by the President of Russia.<ref>''Russian Classification of Economic Regions'' (OK&nbsp;024–95) of 1 January 1997 as amended by the Amendments #1/1998 through #5/2001. (Section&nbsp;I. Federal Districts)</ref> Unlike the federal subjects, the federal districts are not a subnational level of government, but are a level of administration of the federal government. Federal districts' envoys serve as liaisons between the federal subjects and the federal government and are primarily responsible for overseeing the compliance of the federal subjects with the federal laws.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

Russia's territorial expansion was achieved largely in the late 16th century under the Cossack [[Yermak Timofeyevich]] during the reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]], at a time when competing city-states in the western regions of Russia had banded together to form one country. Yermak mustered an army and pushed eastward where he conquered nearly all the lands once belonging to the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], defeating their ruler, [[Kuchum|Khan Kuchum]].<ref>Alton S Donnelly, ''The Russian Conquest of Bashkiria'', 1968, pages 23 and 127; Lincoln, W.

These points are: a {{convert|60|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long [[Vistula Spit]] the boundary with Poland separating the [[Gdańsk Bay]] from the [[Vistula Lagoon]] and the most southeastern point of the [[Kuril Islands]]. The points which are farthest separated in [[longitude]] are {{convert|6600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} apart along a geodesic line. These points are: in the west, the same spit on the boundary with Poland, and in the east, the [[Big Diomede Island]]. The Russian Federation spans 11 [[time zone]]s.

Most of Russia consists of vast stretches of plains that are predominantly [[steppe]] to the south and heavily forested to the north, with [[tundra]] along the northern coast. Russia possesses 10% of the world's [[arable land]].{{cn|date=October 2020}} Mountain ranges are found along the southern borders, such as the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] (containing [[Mount Elbrus]], which at {{convert|5642|m|0|abbr=on}} is the highest point in both Russia and Europe) and the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] (containing [[Mount Belukha]], which at the {{convert|4506|m|0|abbr=on}} is the highest point of Siberia outside of the [[Russian Far East]]); and in the eastern parts, such as the [[Verkhoyansk Range]] or the volcanoes of [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] (containing [[Klyuchevskaya Sopka]], which at the {{convert|4750|m|0|abbr=on}} is the highest [[active volcano]] in Eurasia as well as the highest point of [[Asian Russia]]). The [[Ural Mountains]], rich in mineral resources, form a north–south range that divides Europe and Asia.

Russia has an extensive coastline of over {{convert|37000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} along the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, as well as along the [[Baltic Sea]], [[Sea of Azov]], [[Black Sea]] and [[Caspian Sea]].<ref name="cia">{{cite web|last=The World Factbook|title=CIA|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html|access-date=26 December 2007}}</ref> The [[Barents Sea]], [[White Sea]], [[Kara Sea]], [[Laptev Sea]], [[East Siberian Sea]], [[Chukchi Sea]], [[Bering Sea]], [[Sea of Okhotsk]], and the [[Sea of Japan]] are linked to Russia via the Arctic and Pacific.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Russia}}
The enormous size of Russia and the remoteness of many areas from the sea result in the dominance of the [[humid continental climate]], which is prevalent in all parts of the country except for the tundra and the extreme southwest. Mountains in the south obstruct the flow of warm air masses from the Indian Ocean, while the plain of the west and north makes the country open to Arctic and Atlantic influences.<ref name="congress">{{cite web|title=Climate|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/24.htm|access-date=26 December 2007}}</ref>

Most of Northern European Russia and Siberia has a [[subarctic climate]], with extremely severe winters in the inner regions of Northeast Siberia (mostly the [[Sakha Republic]], where the Northern [[Pole of Cold]] is located with the record low temperature of {{convert|−71.2|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}), and more moderate winters elsewhere. Both the strip of land along the shore of the Arctic Ocean and the [[Russian Arctic islands]] have a [[polar climate]].

The coastal part of [[Krasnodar Krai]] on the Black Sea, most notably in [[Sochi]], possesses a [[humid subtropical climate]] with mild and wet winters. In many regions of East Siberia and the Far East, winter is dry compared to summer; other parts of the country experience more even precipitation across seasons. Winter precipitation in most parts of the country usually falls as snow. The region along the Lower Volga and Caspian Sea coast, as well as some areas of southernmost Siberia, possesses a [[semi-arid climate]].

Much of Russia's inland waterways, which [[List of countries by waterways length|total {{convert|102000|km|0|abbr=on}}]], are made up of natural rivers or lakes. In the European part of the country the network of channels connects the basins of major rivers. Russia's capital, Moscow, is sometimes called "the port of the five seas", because of its waterway connections to the Baltic, [[White Sea|White]], Caspian, [[Azov Sea|Azov]] and [[Black Sea]]s.

Major sea ports of Russia include [[Rostov-on-Don]] on the Azov Sea, [[Novorossiysk]] on the Black Sea, [[Astrakhan]] and [[Makhachkala]] on the Caspian, [[Kaliningrad]] and St Petersburg on the Baltic, [[Arkhangelsk]] on the White Sea, [[Murmansk]] on the Barents Sea, [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] and [[Vladivostok]] on the Pacific Ocean. In 2008 the country owned 1,448 [[Merchant marine by country|merchant marine]] ships. The world's only fleet of [[nuclear-powered icebreaker]]s advances the economic exploitation of the Arctic [[continental shelf of Russia]] and the development of sea trade through the [[Northern Sea Route]] between Europe and East Asia.

By [[total length of pipelines]] Russia is second only to the United States. Currently many new pipeline projects are being realised, including [[Nord Stream]] and [[South Stream]] natural gas pipelines to Europe, and the [[Eastern Siberia – Pacific Ocean oil pipeline]] (ESPO) to the Russian Far East and China.

Russia has 1,216 airports,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2053rank.html |title=CIA The World Factbook–Rank Order–Airports |publisher=Cia.gov |access-date=19 January 2011}}</ref> the busiest being [[Sheremetyevo]], [[Domodedovo International Airport|Domodedovo]], and [[Vnukovo International Airport|Vnukovo]] in Moscow, and [[Pulkovo Airport|Pulkovo]] in St. Petersburg.

Typically, major Russian cities have well-developed systems of public transport, with the most common varieties of exploited vehicles being bus, [[trolleybus]] and tram. Seven Russian cities, namely [[Moscow Metro|Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg Metro|Saint Petersburg]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Metro|Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Novosibirsk Metro|Novosibirsk]], [[Samara Metro|Samara]], [[Yekaterinburg Metro|Yekaterinburg]], and [[Kazan Metro|Kazan]], have underground metros, while [[Volgograd]] features a [[Volgograd Metrotram|metrotram]].

<!-- I guess text below should be reworked, because for now it just looks like a simple listing of names. My advice is to learn how this is done in featured articles about other countries :/ I kinda started myself (paragraph above) -->Science and technology in Russia blossomed since the [[Age of Enlightenment]], when [[Peter the Great]] founded the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and [[Saint Petersburg State University]], and [[polymath]] [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] established the [[Moscow State University]], paving the way for a strong native tradition in learning and innovation. In the 19th and 20th centuries the country produced a large number of notable scientists and inventors.

The [[Russian physics school]] began with Lomonosov who proposed the law of conservation of matter preceding the [[energy conservation law]]. Russian discoveries and inventions in physics include the [[electric arc]], electrodynamical [[Lenz's law]], [[space groups]] of [[crystal]]s, [[photoelectric cell]], [[superfluidity]], [[Cherenkov radiation]], [[electron paramagnetic resonance]], [[heterotransistor]]s and [[3D holography]]. [[Laser]]s and [[maser]]s were co-invented by [[Nikolai Basov]] and [[Alexander Prokhorov]], while the idea of [[tokamak]] for controlled [[nuclear fusion]] was introduced by [[Igor Tamm]], [[Andrei Sakharov]] and [[Lev Artsimovich]], leading eventually the modern international [[ITER]] project, where Russia is a party.

Since the time of [[Nikolay Lobachevsky]] (the "[[Copernicus]] of [[Geometry]]" who pioneered the [[non-Euclidean geometry]]) and a prominent tutor [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]], the [[Russian mathematical school]] became one of the most influential in the world.<ref>{{cite book|title=Russian Mathematicians in the 20th Century|year=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-981-02-4390-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFsnWXkqZaMC|editor=Yakov Sinai}}</ref> Chebyshev's students included [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]], who founded the modern [[stability theory]], and [[Andrey Markov]] who invented the [[Markov chain]]s. In the 20th century Soviet mathematicians, such as [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], [[Israel Gelfand]], and [[Sergey Sobolev]], made major contributions to various areas of mathematics. Nine Soviet/Russian mathematicians were awarded with the [[Fields Medal]], a most prestigious award in mathematics. Recently [[Grigori Perelman]] was offered the first ever Clay [[Millennium Prize Problems]] Award for his final proof of the [[Poincaré conjecture]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claymath.org/poincare/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428112451/http://www.claymath.org/poincare/index.html|archive-date=28 April 2013 |title=The Poincaré Conjecture |publisher=Claymath.org |access-date=4 May 2013}}</ref>

[[Russian chemist]] [[Dmitry Mendeleev]] invented the [[Periodic table]], the main framework of modern [[chemistry]]. [[Aleksandr Butlerov]] was one of the creators of the theory of [[chemical structure]], playing a central role in [[organic chemistry]]. [[Russian biologists]] include [[Dmitry Ivanovsky]] who discovered viruses, [[Ivan Pavlov]] who was the first to experiment with the [[classical conditioning]], and [[Ilya Mechnikov]] who was a pioneer researcher of the [[immune system]] and [[probiotics]].

Many Russian scientists and inventors were [[émigrés]], like [[Igor Sikorsky]], who built the first [[airliner]]s and modern-type helicopters; [[Vladimir Zworykin]], often called the father of television; chemist [[Ilya Prigogine]], noted for his work on [[dissipative structures]] and [[complex systems]]; Nobel Prize-winning economists [[Simon Kuznets]] and [[Wassily Leontief]]; physicist [[Georgiy Gamov]] (an author of the [[Big Bang]] theory) and social scientist [[Pitirim Sorokin]]. Many foreigners worked in Russia for a long time, like [[Leonard Euler]] and [[Alfred Nobel]].

[[Russian inventions]] include [[arc welding]] by [[Nikolay Benardos]], further developed by [[Nikolay Slavyanov]], [[Konstantin Khrenov]] and other Russian engineers. [[Gleb Kotelnikov]] invented the [[knapsack parachute]], while [[Evgeniy Chertovsky]] introduced the [[pressure suit]]. [[Alexander Lodygin]] and [[Pavel Yablochkov]] were pioneers of [[electric lighting]], and [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] introduced the first [[three-phase electric power]] systems, widely used today. [[Sergei Vasiljevich Lebedev|Sergei Lebedev]] invented the first commercially viable and mass-produced type of [[synthetic rubber]]. The first [[ternary computer]], ''[[Setun]]'', was developed by [[Nikolay Brusentsov]].

[[File:Soyuz TMA-2 launch.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Soyuz TMA-2]] being launched from [[Baikonur]], [[Kazakhstan]], carrying one of the first resident crews to the [[International Space Station]]]]
In the 20th century a number of prominent [[Soviet aerospace engineers]], inspired by the fundamental works of [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]], [[Sergei Chaplygin]] and others, designed many hundreds of models of military and civilian aircraft and founded a number of ''KBs'' (''Construction Bureaus'') that now constitute the bulk of Russian [[United Aircraft Corporation]]. Famous Russian aircraft include the civilian [[Tupolev|Tu]]-series, [[Sukhoi|Su]] and [[MiG]] fighter aircraft, [[Kamov|Ka]] and [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant|Mi]]-series helicopters; many Russian aircraft models are on the [[list of most produced aircraft]] in history.

Famous Russian battle tanks include [[T-34|T34]], the most heavily produced tank design of World War&nbsp;II,<ref>[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/panzerkampfwagen-t-34r-soviet-t-34-in-german-service.htm Panzerkampfwagen T-34(r)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222215401/http://www.achtungpanzer.com/panzerkampfwagen-t-34r-soviet-t-34-in-german-service.htm |date=22 February 2011 }} by George Parada (n.d.)

With all these achievements, however, since the late Soviet era Russia was lagging behind the West in a number of technologies, mostly those related to [[energy conservation]] and [[consumer goods]] production. The crisis of the 1990s led to the drastic reduction of the state support for science and a [[brain drain]] migration from Russia.

In the 2000s, on the wave of a new economic boom, the situation in the Russian science and technology has improved, and the government [[Medvedev modernisation programme|launched a campaign]] aimed into modernisation and [[innovation]]. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev formulated top priorities for the country's technological development:
* [[Efficient energy use]]
* Information technology, including both common products and the products combined with [[space technology]]
* [[Nuclear power|Nuclear energy]]
* [[Pharmaceuticals]]{{cn|date=October 2020}}

Currently Russia has completed the [[GLONASS]] [[satellite navigation system]]. The country is developing its own [[Sukhoi PAK FA|fifth-generation jet fighter]] and constructing the first serial [[mobile nuclear plant]] in the world.

=== Space exploration ===
Russian achievements in the field of [[space technology]] and [[space exploration]] are traced back to [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], the father of theoretical [[astronautics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaa.org/index.cfm|title=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|publisher=Aiaa.org|access-date=2 January 2010}}{{cbignore}}</ref> His works had inspired leading Soviet rocket engineers, such as [[Sergey Korolyov]], [[Valentin Glushko]], and many others who contributed to the success of the [[Soviet space program]] in the early stages of the [[Space Race]] and beyond.

In 1957 the first Earth-orbiting artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik&nbsp;1]]'', was launched; in 1961 the first human trip into space was successfully made by [[Yuri Gagarin]]. Many other Soviet and Russian [[space exploration records]] ensued, including the first [[spacewalk]] performed by [[Alexei Leonov]], [[Luna&nbsp;9]] was the first spacecraft to land on the [[Moon]], [[Zond 5]] brought the first Earthlings (two tortoises and other life forms) to circumnavigate the Moon, [[Venera&nbsp;7]] was the first to land on another planet ([[Venus]]), [[Mars&nbsp;3]] then the first to land on [[Mars]], the first [[space exploration rover]] ''[[Lunokhod-1|Lunokhod 1]]'', and the first [[space station]] ''[[Salyut&nbsp;1]]'' and ''[[Mir]]''.

After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], some government-funded space exploration programs, including the [[Buran programme|Buran]] space shuttle program, were cancelled or delayed, while participation of the Russian space industry in commercial activities and international cooperation intensified.
Nowadays Russia is the largest satellite launcher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/2009.html |title=Russian space program in 2009: plans and reality |publisher=Russianspaceweb.com |access-date=27 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128201450/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/2009.html |archive-date=28 January 2010}}</ref> After the United States [[Space Shuttle]] program ended in 2011, [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rockets]] became the only provider of transport for astronauts at the [[International Space Station]].

[[Luna-Glob]] is a Russian Moon exploration programme, with first planned mission launch in 2021. Roscosmos is also developing the [[Orel spacecraft]], to replace the aging Soyuz, it could also conduct mission to lunar orbit as early as 2026.<ref>{{cite news |title=В "Роскосмосе" решили переименовать новый космический корабль |url=https://www.pravda.ru/news/science/1432996-roskosmos/?spot_im_verify=signup&spot_im_token_ticket=4d323059ecb841b0b1e3c4168b1f244b |work=Правда.Ру |date=6 September 2019 |language=ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Russia may select first crew for its Federation spacecraft next year |url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/roscosmos/russia-may-select-first-crew-federation-spacecraft-next-year/ |work=www.spaceflightinsider.com}}</ref> In February 2019, it was announced that Russia is intending to conduct its first crewed mission to land on the Moon in 2031.<ref>{{cite news |script-title=ru:Российские космонавты высадятся на Луну в 2031 году |url=https://ria.ru/20190209/1550625837.html |work=РИА Новости |date=9 February 2019 |language=ru}}</ref>

There are over 160 different ethnic groups and indigenous peoples in Russia.<ref name=ethnicgroups /> The country's vast cultural diversity spans ethnic [[Russians]] with their [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] traditions, [[Tatars]] and [[Bashkirs]] with their Turkic Muslim culture, [[Buddhist]] [[nomad]]ic [[Buryats]] and [[Kalmyks]], [[Shamanistic]] peoples of the [[Extreme North]] and Siberia, highlanders of the [[Northern Caucasus]], and [[Finno-Ugric peoples]] of the [[Russian North West]] and [[Volga Region]].

[[Handicraft]], like [[Dymkovo toy]], [[khokhloma]], [[gzhel]] and [[palekh miniature]] represent an important aspect of Russian [[folk culture]]. Ethnic Russian clothes include [[kaftan]], [[kosovorotka]] and [[ushanka]] for men, [[sarafan]] and [[kokoshnik]] for women, with [[lapti]] and [[valenki]] as common shoes. The clothes of [[Cossack]]s from Southern Russia include [[Burka (Caucasus)|burka]] and [[papaha]], which they share with the peoples of the Northern Caucasus.

[[Russian cuisine]] widely uses fish, caviar, poultry, mushrooms, berries, and honey. Crops of [[rye]], wheat, [[barley]], and [[millet]] provide the ingredients for various breads, [[pancake]]s and cereals, as well as for [[kvass]], beer and vodka drinks. [[Black bread]] is rather popular in Russia, compared to the rest of the world. Flavourful soups and stews include [[shchi]], [[borsch]], [[ukha]], [[solyanka]] and [[okroshka]]. [[Smetana (dairy product)|Smetana]] (a heavy [[sour cream]]) is often added to soups and salads. [[Pirozhki]], [[blini]] and [[syrniki]] are native types of pancakes.

Russia's large number of ethnic groups have distinctive traditions regarding [[Music of Russia#Ethnic roots music|folk music]]. Typical ethnic Russian musical instruments are [[gusli]], [[balalaika]], [[zhaleika]], and [[garmoshka]]. Folk music had a significant influence on Russian classical composers, and in modern times it is a source of inspiration for a number of popular [[folk band]]s, like Melnitsa. [[Russian folk songs]], as well as patriotic [[Soviet songs]], constitute the bulk of the repertoire of the world-renowned [[Alexandrov Ensemble|Red Army choir]] and other popular ensembles.

Russians have [[Russian traditions|many traditions]], including the washing in [[banya (sauna)|banya]], a hot steam bath somewhat similar to [[sauna]].<ref name="banya" /> Old [[Russian folklore]] takes its roots in the pagan [[Slavic mythology|Slavic religion]].

Russian poets, including [[Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov|Pyotr Yershov]] and [[Leonid Filatov]], made a number of well-known poetical interpretations of the classical fairy tales, and in some cases, like that of [[Alexander Pushkin]], also created fully original fairy tale poems of great popularity.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

=== Architecture ===

[[File:1 Saint Basils Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in [[Red Square]], [[Moscow]], one of the most popular symbols of the country]]

Since the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus']] for several ages Russian architecture was influenced predominantly by the [[Byzantine architecture]]. Apart from fortifications ([[kremlin]]s), the main stone buildings of ancient Rus' were [[Orthodox church (building)|Orthodox churches]] with their many [[dome]]s, often gilded or brightly painted.

[[Aristotle Fioravanti]] and other Italian architects brought [[Renaissance]] trends into Russia since the late 15th century, while the 16th century saw the development of unique [[tent-like church]]es culminating in [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116214934/http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky19.htm The first stone tented roof church and the origins of the tented roof architecture] by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at RusArch.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref> By that time the [[onion dome]] design was also fully developed.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116215900/http://www.rusarch.ru/zagraevsky1.htm The shapes of domes of ancient Russian churches] by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]] at the site of RusArch.ru {{in lang|ru}}</ref> In the 17th century, the "fiery style" of ornamentation flourished in Moscow and [[Yaroslavl]], gradually paving the way for the [[Naryshkin baroque]] of the 1690s. After the [[reforms of Peter the Great]] the change of architectural styles in Russia generally followed that in the Western Europe.

The 18th-century taste for [[rococo]] architecture led to the ornate works of [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and his followers. The reigns of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;I]] saw the flourishing of [[Neoclassical architecture]], most notably in the capital city of [[Saint Petersburg]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the [[Neo-Byzantine architecture in the Russian Empire|Neo-Byzantine]] and [[Russian Revival]] styles. Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the [[Art Nouveau]], [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]], and the [[Stalin Empire style]].

[[File:Saint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|thumb|The neoclassical [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]]]

[[Russian cultural heritage register#Denial of heritage (1917–1941)|With the change in values imposed by communist ideology]], the tradition of preservation was broken. Independent preservation societies, even those that defended only secular landmarks such as Moscow-based OIRU were disbanded by the end of the 1920s. A new anti-religious campaign, launched in 1929, coincided with collectivization of peasants; destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932. A number of churches were demolished, including the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in Moscow. [[Russian cultural heritage register#Post-Soviet Russia (1991–present)|In Moscow alone losses of 1917–2006]] are estimated at over 640 notable buildings (including 150 to 200 listed buildings, out of a total inventory of 3,500) – some disappeared completely, others were replaced with concrete replicas.

In 1955, a new Soviet leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], condemned the "excesses" of the former academic architecture,<ref>Russian: Постановление ЦК КПСС и СМ СССР "Об устранении излишеств в проектировании и строительстве", 4 November 1955 (Khrushchev's decree ''On liquidation of excesses&nbsp;...'') {{in lang|ru}}</ref> and the late Soviet era was dominated by plain [[functionalism in architecture]]. This helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem, but created a large quantity of buildings of low architectural quality, much in contrast with the previous bright styles. [[Russian cultural heritage register#Khrushchev's offensive (1959–1964)|In 1959 Nikita Khrushchev launched his anti-religious campaign]]. By 1964 over 10 thousand churches out of 20 thousand were shut down (mostly in rural areas) and many were demolished. Of 58 monasteries and convents operating in 1959, only sixteen remained by 1964; of Moscow's fifty churches operating in 1959, thirty were closed and six demolished.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In the early 19th century, when [[neoclassicism]] and [[romantism]] flourished, mythological and Biblical themes inspired many prominent paintings, notably by [[Karl Briullov]] and [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]].

In the mid-19th century the ''[[Peredvizhniki]]'' (''Wanderers'') group of artists broke with the Academy and initiated a school of art liberated from academic restrictions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gray|first=Camilla|title=Russian Experiment in Art|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|year=2002|page=9}}</ref> These were mostly [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] painters who captured Russian identity in landscapes of wide rivers, forests, and birch clearings, as well as vigorous genre scenes and robust portraits of their contemporaries. Some artists focused on depicting dramatic moments in Russian history, while others turned to [[social criticism]], showing the conditions of the poor and caricaturing authority; [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] flourished under the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. Leading realists include [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], [[Ivan Kramskoi]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], [[Ilya Repin]], and [[Boris Kustodiev]].

The turn of the 20th century saw the rise of [[symbolism (art)|symbolist]] painting, represented by [[Mikhail Vrubel]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], and [[Nicholas Roerich]].

The [[Russian avant-garde]] was a large, influential wave of [[modernist art]] that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related art movements that occurred at the time, namely [[neo-primitivism]], [[suprematism]], [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[rayonism]], and [[Russian Futurism]]. Notable artists from this era include [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and [[Marc Chagall]]. Since the 1930s the revolutionary ideas of the [[avant-garde]] clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of [[socialist realism]].

Soviet art produced works that were furiously patriotic and [[anti-fascist]] during and after the [[Great Patriotic War]]. Multiple war memorials, marked by a great restrained solemnity, were built throughout the country. Soviet artists often combined innovation with socialist realism, notably the sculptors [[Vera Mukhina]], [[Yevgeny Vuchetich]] and [[Ernst Neizvestny]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In the 18th century, during the era of [[Russian Enlightenment]], the development of [[Russian literature]] was boosted by the works of [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] and [[Denis Fonvizin]]. By the early 19th century a modern national tradition had emerged, producing some of the greatest writers in Russian history. This period, known also as the [[Golden Age of Russian Poetry]], began with [[Alexander Pushkin]], who is considered the founder of the modern Russian literary language and often described as the "Russian Shakespeare".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kelly|first=Catriona|title=Russian Literature: A Very Short Introduction (Paperback)|publisher=Oxford Paperbacks|isbn=978-0-19-280144-9|year=2001|url=https://archive.org/details/russianliteratur00kell_0}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2019}} It continued with the poetry of [[Mikhail Lermontov]] and [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], dramas of [[Alexander Ostrovsky]] and [[Anton Chekhov]], and the prose of [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[Ivan Turgenev]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] have been described by literary critics as the greatest novelists of all time.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513793/Russian-literature|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=11 April 2008|title=Russian literature; Leo Tolstoy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|work=Time Magazine |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943893,00.html|access-date=10 April 2008|title=Freaking-Out with Fyodor|author=Otto Friedrich|date=6 September 1971}}</ref>

[[File:Vasily Perov - Портрет Ф.М.Достоевского - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]]]

By the 1880s, the age of the great novelists was over, and short fiction and poetry became the dominant genres. The next several decades became known as the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]], when the previously dominant [[literary realism]] was replaced by [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]. Leading authors of this era include such poets as [[Valery Bryusov]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Alexander Blok]], [[Nikolay Gumilev]] and [[Anna Akhmatova]], and novelists [[Leonid Andreyev]], [[Ivan Bunin]], and [[Maxim Gorky]].

[[Russian philosophy]] blossomed in the 19th century, when it was defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizer]]s, who advocated Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], who insisted on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group includes [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the founders of [[eurasianism]]. In its further development Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, politics and nationalism; [[Russian cosmism]] and religious philosophy were other major areas. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and the early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyev]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], and [[Vladimir Vernadsky]].

[[File:AleksandrPushkin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Alexander Pushkin]] (portrait by [[Vasily Tropinin]])]]

Following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 many prominent writers and philosophers left the country, including Bunin, [[Vladimir Nabokov]] and [[Nikolay Berdyayev]], while a new generation of talented authors joined together in an effort to create a distinctive [[working-class culture]] appropriate for the new Soviet state. In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with the policy of [[socialist realism]]. In the late 1950s restrictions on literature were eased, and by the 1970s and 1980s, writers were increasingly ignoring official guidelines. Leading authors of the Soviet era include novelists [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]] (emigrated), [[Ilf and Petrov]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] (censored) and [[Mikhail Sholokhov]], and poets [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], and [[Andrey Voznesensky]].

The Soviet Union was also a major producer of science fiction, written by authors like [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]], [[Kir Bulychov]], [[Alexander Belayev]] and [[Ivan Yefremov]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=McGuire|first=Patrick L.|title=Red stars: political aspects of Soviet science fiction|journal=Studies in Speculative Fiction|issue=7|publisher=UMI Research Press|isbn=978-0-8357-1579-9|editor=Robert Scholes|year=1985|url=https://archive.org/details/redstarspolitica00mcgu}}{{page needed|date=August 2019}}{{cite book|last=Glad|first=John|title=Russian Soviet science fiction and related critical activity|publisher=New York University|year=1971}}{{page needed|date=August 2019}}{{cite book|author=Tevis, Yvonne Pacheco, Reginald, R. |title=East of the Sun: Russian and Eastern European Science Fiction.

Russian and later [[Soviet cinema]] was a hotbed of invention in the period immediately following 1917, resulting in world-renowned films such as ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' by [[Sergei Eisenstein]].<ref name="film">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Russia:Motion pictures|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia|access-date=27 December 2007}}</ref> Eisenstein was a student of filmmaker and theorist [[Lev Kuleshov]], who developed the [[Soviet montage theory]] of film editing at the world's first film school, the [[All-Union Institute of Cinematography]]. [[Dziga Vertov]], whose ''kino-glaz'' ("film-eye") theory—that the camera, like the human eye, is best used to explore real life—had a huge impact on the development of documentary film making and cinema realism. The subsequent state policy of socialist realism somewhat limited creativity; however, many Soviet films in this style were artistically successful, including ''[[Chapaev (film)|Chapaev]]'', ''[[The Cranes Are Flying]]'', and ''[[Ballad of a Soldier]]''.<ref name=film />

The 1960s and 1970s saw a greater variety of artistic styles in Soviet cinema. [[Eldar Ryazanov]]'s and [[Leonid Gaidai]]'s comedies of that time were immensely popular, with many of the catch phrases still in use today. In 1961–68 [[Sergey Bondarchuk]] directed an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning [[War and Peace (film series)|film adaptation]] of Leo Tolstoy's epic ''[[War and Peace]]'', which was [[the most expensive film]] made in the Soviet Union.<ref>Birgit Beumers.

[[Russian animation]] dates back to late [[Russian Empire]] times. During the Soviet era, [[Soyuzmultfilm]] studio was the largest animation producer. Soviet animators developed a great variety of pioneering techniques and aesthetic styles, with prominent directors including [[Ivan Ivanov-Vano]], [[Fyodor Khitruk]] and [[Aleksandr Tatarsky]]. Many Soviet cartoon heroes such as the Russian-style [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], cute little [[Cheburashka]], Wolf and Hare from ''[[Nu, Pogodi!]]'', are iconic images in Russia and many surrounding countries.

The late 1980s and 1990s were a period of crisis in Russian cinema and animation. Although Russian filmmakers became free to express themselves, state subsidies were drastically reduced, resulting in fewer films produced. The early years of the 21st century have brought increased viewership and subsequent prosperity to the industry on the back of the economic revival. Production levels are already higher than in Britain and Germany.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dzieciolowski, Z|title=Kinoeye: Russia's reviving film industry|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-Film/russian_film_3726.jsp|access-date=27 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221031103/http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-Film/russian_film_3726.jsp|archive-date=21 December 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Russia's total box-office revenue in 2007 was $565&nbsp;million, up 37% from the previous year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Entertainment & Media Industry worth $27.9 bn by 2011|publisher=joomag magazine|url=http://www.joomag.com/magazine/Russia/4228/p44|access-date=3 October 2010}}</ref>{{Update inline|date=November 2020|reason=}} In 2002 the ''[[Russian Ark]]'' became the first feature film ever to be shot in a single take.
