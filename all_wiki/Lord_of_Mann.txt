{{Politics of the Isle of Man}}
The '''Lord of Mann''' ({{lang-gv|Çhiarn Vannin}}) is the [[Lords Proprietor|Lord Proprietor]]<ref>[http://www.tynwald.org.im/tynwald/today.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203173417/http://www.tynwald.org.im/tynwald/today.shtml |date=December 3, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/6151288.stm | work=BBC News | title=A new electorate for the Isle of Man | date=19 November 2006 | accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> and [[head of state]] of the [[Isle of Man]]. The current lord proprietor and head of state is [[Elizabeth II]].

==Relationship with the Crown==
The title is not correctly{{according to whom|date=October 2020}} used on its own. Since 1399, the [[King of Mann|kings]] and lords of Mann were [[vassals]] of the [[kings of England]], and subsequently of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and the [[United Kingdom]], who was the ultimate [[sovereign]] of the island. This right of 'Lord Proprietor' was [[Revestment (Isle of Man)|revested]] into [[the Crown]] by the [[Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765]] for £70,000 and a £2,000 annuity, and hence ceased to exist separately. [[King George III]] became the first British monarch to reign over the Isle of Man as Lord of Mann in 1765.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandCrowndependencies/IsleofMan.aspx |title=The official website of The British Monarchy |publisher=Royal.gov.uk |accessdate=2013-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195227/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandCrowndependencies/IsleofMan.aspx |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}</ref> However, for reasons of culture and tradition, the title Lord of Mann continues to be used. For these reasons, the correct formal usage, as used in the Isle of Man for the [[Loyal toast|Loyal Toast]], is ''The Queen, Lord of Mann''.

The title is now ''Lord of Mann'' regardless of gender. However, during her reign, [[Queen Victoria]] was styled as ''Lady of Mann''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/fulltext/cw1899/index.htm#contents |title=Contents - From King Orry to Queen Victoria, 1899 |publisher=Isle-of-man.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-27}}</ref>

The formal [[Latin]] style is {{lang|la|Dominus Manniae}}.

===16th century===
*[[Thomas Stanley, 2nd Earl of Derby|Thomas, Earl of Derby]], 1504–1521

*[[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby|Ferdinando, Earl of Derby]], 1593–1594

===Succession dispute (1594–1607)===
In 1598, a succession dispute between the daughters of [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby|Ferdinando]] and their uncle, [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|William, Earl of Derby]] was heard by the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]]. They decided that the right to the Isle of Man belonged solely to [[Queen Elizabeth I]], and the [[letters patent]] of 1405 which conferred the lordship of the Isle of Man on the Stanley family were declared null and void as the previous ruler, [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Henry, Earl of Northumberland]], had not been subject to legal [[attainder]], despite his treason, and the 1405 and 1406 letters patent had therefore not taken effect.<ref>{{citation

The Queen, in consideration of the "many eminent services performed to herself and to her royal predecessors by the honourable and noble House of Stanley", withdrew her right and referred the contending claimants to the decision of the Privy Council as to the best claim of inheritance.

The [[Law Lords]] on the Privy Council decided "the grant being by letters patent under the Great Seal of England, such right would descend according to the Common Law of England to the heirs general, and not to the heirs male", and the island was therefore awarded to Ferdinando's daughters; whereupon William agreed to purchase their several shares and interests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/people/lords/william6.htm |title=William, Sixth Earl of Derby |publisher=Isle-of-man.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-27}}</ref>

The original letters patent having been declared void, the [[Parliament of England]] in 1609 under [[James I of England|James I]] passed a Private [[Act of Parliament]] entitled "An Act for assuring and establishing the Isle of Man in the name and blood of William, Earl of Derby" [(1609) 7 Jac.1 c.4]<ref>{{citation | last = Mills | first = M A | title = Ancient Ordinances and Statute Laws of the Isle of Man | location = Douglas | year = 1821 | pages = 522–527 | url = http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/manxsoc/msvol12/p035.htm }}</ref> which established the title in law as ''Lord of Mann''.

===Interim lords (1607–1609)===
Following the resolution of the succession dispute, it was ruled that the daughters of Ferdinando Stanley were the rightful heirs. As the oldest of them would not reach the [[age of majority]] until 1609, two temporary Lords of Mann were appointed by [[James I of England|James I]] by letters patent,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/manxsoc/msvol04/v3p088.htm |title=pp88 - Manx Soc vol 9 'Monumenta de Insula Manniae - Vol 3' |publisher=Isle-of-man.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-27}}</ref> so that the daughters could benefit from the Island's revenues.
*[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Henry, Earl of Northampton]], 1607–1608
*[[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert, Earl of Salisbury]], 1608–1609

Following the coming of age of the heirs, the rights over the island were sold to their uncle, William Stanley. He took up the title of Lord of Mann following the passing of an Act of Parliament.<ref>An Act for assuring and establishing the Isle of Man in the name and blood of William, Earl of Derby, 1909, Private Act c.4</ref>

===17th and 18th centuries===
*[[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|William, Earl of Derby]], 1609–1612
*[[Elizabeth de Vere, Countess of Derby|Elizabeth, Countess of Derby]], 1612–1627
*[[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby|James, Earl of Derby]], 1627–1651 (known as ''the Great Stanley'')
*[[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas, Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], 1651–1660 (appointed by [[Oliver Cromwell]] during the [[English Interregnum]])
*[[Charles Stanley, 8th Earl of Derby|Charles, Earl of Derby]], 1660–1672 (restored by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]])
*[[William Richard George Stanley, 9th Earl of Derby|William, Earl of Derby]], 1672–1702
*[[James Stanley, 10th Earl of Derby|James, Earl of Derby]], 1702–1736
*[[James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl|James, Duke of Atholl]], 1736–1764
*[[Charlotte Murray, 8th Baroness Strange|Charlotte, Duchess of Atholl]] and [[John Murray, 3rd Duke of Atholl|John, Duke of Atholl]],  1764–1765

===Revestment===
In 1765, [[Charlotte Murray, 8th Baroness Strange|Charlotte Murray, Duchess of Atholl, 8th Baroness Strange]], sold the [[suzerainty]] of the island to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] government for £70,000 and an annuity of £2,000 (£5,235,000 and £150,000 respectively in modern terms). By the passage of the [[Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765]] the title of Lord of Mann was [[wikt:revest|revested]] into the [[the Crown|British Crown]]. It has therefore since been used in the Isle of Man to refer to the reigning [[British monarch]].

In 1828, all remaining property interests and rights of the [[dukes of Atholl]] on the island were sold to [[HM Treasury]], a department of the British government, for the sum of £417,144, {{Inflation|UK|417144|1828|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/results.asp#mid |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/history/revest.htm |title=History Pages Isle of Man -Act of Revestment |publisher=Isle-of-man.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-27}}</ref>
This was accomplished by two Private Acts of Parliament:

* ''"An Act empowering the Lords of the Treasury to Purchase all the Manorial Rights of the Duke of Atholl in the Isle of Man"'' [c. 34] 10 June 1824
* ''"An Act to empower the Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury to purchase a certain Annuity in respect of Duties and Customs levied in the Isle of Man, and any reserved sovereign rights in the said Island belonging to John Duke of Atholl"'' [c. 34] 10 June 1825

==Lieutenant governor==
The lord of Mann is now represented by the [[lieutenant governor of the Isle of Man]].
