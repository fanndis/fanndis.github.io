'''Starz''' (stylized as '''STARZ''' since 2016; pronounced "stars") is an American [[Pay television|premium]] [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] [[television network]] that is owned by [[Lionsgate|Lions Gate Entertainment]], and is the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] property of parent subsidiary [[Starz Inc.]] Programming on Starz consists of [[Art release#Film|theatrically released]] [[film|motion pictures]] and first-run [[Original series|original]] [[television program|television series]].

Starz, originally stylized as "STARZ!" with an exclamation point, was launched at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on February 1, 1994, primarily on cable systems operated by [[Tele-Communications Inc.]]; the first two movies aired on the network were dramas released in 1992: respectively, ''[[Scent of a Woman (1992 film)|Scent of a Woman]]''<ref name="Starz Launch">{{cite press release|title=Starz!, New Premium Channel, Launches Tonight with Unprecedented Support from Major Hollywood Studios|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/STARZ!,+NEW+PREMIUM+CHANNEL,+LAUNCHES+TONIGHT+WITH+UNPRECEDENTED...-a014767050|agency=PR Newswire|via=The Free Library|date=February 1, 1994|accessdate=February 24, 2011|archive-date=February 3, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203202804/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/STARZ!,+NEW+PREMIUM+CHANNEL,+LAUNCHES+TONIGHT+WITH+UNPRECEDENTED...-a014767050|url-status=live}}</ref> and ''[[The Crying Game]]''. The network was originally operated as a [[joint venture]] between TCI and [[Liberty Media]] (both companies were controlled by [[John C. Malone|John Malone]]), with TCI owning a 50.1% controlling interest in the channel.<ref name="Starz!

Starz made its debut as the first phase of a seven-channel thematic [[multiplex (TV)|multiplex]] that was launched by Starz (then Encore Media Group) over the course of the succeeding eight months, with the remaining six channels being launched between July and September 1994.<ref name="Encore Universal">{{cite web|title=Encore Media Corp. signed a deal with Universal film studios that will allow Encore to launch its own movie service as its seventh multiplexed channel|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13922902.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105151254/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13922902.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|via=HighBeam Research|date=May 31, 1993|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ENCORE CELEBRATES THE EXPANSION OF SIX MULTIPLEX CHANNELS BY HONORING FILM GREATS|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ENCORE+CELEBRATES+THE+EXPANSION+OF+SIX+MULTIPLEX+CHANNELS+BY+HONORING...-a015512904|agency=PR Newswire|via=The Free Library|date=June 29, 1994|access-date=March 8, 2013|archive-date=October 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021194737/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ENCORE+CELEBRATES+THE+EXPANSION+OF+SIX+MULTIPLEX+CHANNELS+BY+HONORING...-a015512904|url-status=live}}</ref> The multiplex was intended to only include six channels, however on May 31, 1993, Encore acquired the pay cable rights to telecast recent feature films from [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] released after that year; as a result, TCI/Liberty decided to create an additional premium pay TV service to serve as a competitor to [[HBO]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]].<ref name="Encore Universal"/> The network carried the moniker "Encore 8" in its on-air branding as part of a numbering system that was used by Encore's multiplex channels.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encore to spin off channels early|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-14791539.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105152511/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-14791539.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|via=HighBeam Research|date=December 6, 1993|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Early trademark filings indicated that TCI/Liberty originally proposed names including "Applause" and "Stars" for the service (the "s" in the latter was ultimately changed to a "z" in the final naming).

Starz focused more on recent feature films, while Starz Encore (then Encore) focused on films released between the 1960s and the 1980s, before adding recent film fare itself in July 1999. It also held the television rights to releases from [[Carolco Pictures]], [[New Line Cinema]] (as well as its sibling labels [[Fine Line Features]] and [[Turner Entertainment|Turner Pictures]]), and the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]]–owned studios [[Touchstone Pictures]], [[Hollywood Pictures]] and [[Miramax]]. Films from those studios were not carried on Starz until 1997, after Disney's output agreement with Showtime for its non-family-oriented films concluded. The network restricted the scheduling of films that contained graphic sexual or violent content to late evening and overnight time periods.<ref>{{cite web|title=TCI details Starz! rollout plans; Tele-Communications Inc. to launch Starz! premium pay service|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15152448.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105152818/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15152448.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Kim Mitchell|periodical=[[Multichannel News]]|publisher=[[Fairchild Publications]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=January 31, 1994|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

Starz's availability was mainly limited to TCI's systems at launch, debuting with a one-month [[free preview]] available to prospective subscribers; it would eventually sign its first major carriage agreement outside the TCI group, through a deal with Continental Cablevision in September 1995.<ref>{{cite web|title=Starz! signs Continental as first major non-TCI MSO|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17777868.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105152824/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17777868.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Richard Katz|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Fairchild Publications|via=HighBeam Research|date=September 18, 1995|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> In June 1997, [[Comcast]] signed an agreement to carry the network on its [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New Jersey]] systems to replace [[Philadelphia]]-based [[PRISM (TV network)|PRISM]] after that network shut down that October following the loss of its (and sister network [[SportsChannel Philadelphia]]'s) sports programming to [[Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Starz On The Horizon Goodbye Prism & Sports Channel; What's Next Depends On Where You Hang The Clicker|url=http://articles.philly.com/1997-08-25/news/25568592_1_starz-premium-channel-suburban-cable|author=Rose DeWolf|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|publisher=[[Knight Ridder]]|date=August 25, 1997|accessdate=April 13, 2015|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000926/http://articles.philly.com/1997-08-25/news/25568592_1_starz-premium-channel-suburban-cable|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Comcast Commits to Launch STARZ! in Philadelphia; More Than 300,000 Comcast Customers Will See STARZ! by October 1|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Comcast+Commits+to+Launch+STARZ!+in+Philadelphia%3b+More+Than+300%2c000...-a019597847|agency=PR Newswire|via=The Free Library|date=July 21, 1997|access-date=March 8, 2013|archive-date=March 3, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303004628/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Comcast+Commits+to+Launch+STARZ!+in+Philadelphia%3b+More+Than+300%2c000...-a019597847|url-status=live}}</ref> The network gained carriage deals with many other major U.S. cable and satellite providers by the early 2000s, particularly with the adoption of [[digital cable]], allowing for providers to add channels that they (even with capacity expansions of up to 60 channels) previously had limited room to carry. Starz was available to an estimated 2.8 million pay television subscribers by 1996, only one million of whom had subscribed to a cable or satellite provider other than TCI.<ref>{{cite web|title=Starz!, Encore snag pay nets at TCI|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17888322.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105152801/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17888322.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=[[John M.

As a startup network, Starz endured major losses during its early years, with total deficits topping US$203 million and annual losses of US$150 million by 1997. It was predicted to lose an additional US$300 million in revenue before it was predicted to break even.<ref>{{cite web|title=Starz! awaits digital TV platforms; losses expected to hit $300 million before break-even|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18722095.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105152831/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18722095.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Rich Brown|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|via=HighBeam Research|date=September 30, 1996|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref> Partly in an effort to get the network's substantial losses off its books, TCI announced a deal on June 2, 1997, in which it transferred majority ownership of the corporate entity that operated Starz, Encore Media Group, to sister company Liberty Media; TCI retained a 20% minority ownership interest in Encore Media Group. Liberty Media assumed the former company's stake in the subsidiary in 1999, following TCI's merger with [[AT&T Corporation]].<ref name="Starz!

On April 5, 2016, Starz was rebranded, introducing a new logo, this time stylized as "STARZ" in all uppercase. As part of the rebranding, Starz added all the [[Encore (TV network)|Encore]] channels to its moniker, therefore increasing the Starz channel lineup to 14 Starz premium channels.

In April 2019, Starz was widely criticized in the tech press and by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] for sending legal demands to [[Twitter]] in order to remove links to a news article which discussed piracy but contained neither pirated content nor links to pirated content. Starz initially responded by issuing further [[DMCA]] complaints against those criticizing them, including against a tweet from the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] stating that "Starz should withdraw its takedown and refrain from harassing journalists". However, they subsequently apologized, clarified that the invalid DMCA claims were sent on their behalf by a third party contractor called The Social Element and promised that they are "working with our vendors to reinstate any such content that was inappropriately targeted for removal."<ref name="theguardian.com">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/15/free-speech-row-us-tv-channel-forces-removal-of-tweets |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-05-28 |archive-date=2019-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529020241/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/15/free-speech-row-us-tv-channel-forces-removal-of-tweets |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/04/twitter-copyright-enforcement-gets-absurd-blocks-links-to-news-articles/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-05-28 |archive-date=2019-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528184345/https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/04/twitter-copyright-enforcement-gets-absurd-blocks-links-to-news-articles/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/starz-torrentfreak-american-gods-twitter-takedown-1202596298/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-05-28 |archive-date=2019-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528184347/https://deadline.com/2019/04/starz-torrentfreak-american-gods-twitter-takedown-1202596298/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/twitter-doesnt-want-you-sharing-this-link-about-tv-pira-1834043362 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-05-28 |archive-date=2019-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528184351/https://gizmodo.com/twitter-doesnt-want-you-sharing-this-link-about-tv-pira-1834043362 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Channels==
===List of channels===
Depending on the service provider, Starz provides up to twelve multiplex channels – six 24-hour multiplex channels, all of which are [[simulcast]] in both [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] and [[high-definition television|high definition]] – as well as a [[video on demand|subscription video-on-demand]] service (Starz On Demand). Starz broadcasts its primary and multiplex channels on Eastern and [[Pacific Time Zone]] schedules. The respective coastal feeds of each channel are usually packaged together (though most cable providers only offer the east and west coast feeds of the main Starz channel), resulting in the [[Effects of time zones on North American broadcasting|difference in local airtimes]] for a particular movie or program between two geographic locations being three hours at most.

The premium film services Encore and MoviePlex, which are also owned by Starz, Inc., operate as separate services; as such, subscribers to one of the services do not have to subscribe to any of the others. Some providers offer Encore and MoviePlex's multiplex channels on a separate digital cable tier from Starz. However, Encore and, depending on its carriage, MoviePlex are frequently sold together in a package with Starz.

The main Starz channel commonly premieres recent theatrically released hit movies – debuting on the channel within a lag of between eight months to one year on average from their initial theatrical release – on most Friday nights at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time, as part of a weekly feature film block called the "Starz Friday Night Feature Premiere" (originally airing on Saturday nights until 2013, and known as "Starz Saturday Opening Night" until 2002 and "Starz Saturday Premiere" from 2002 to 2013).

It was launched in March 1996 as '''Starz! 2''', and was rebranded as '''Starz!

Launched in 1997 as a joint venture with [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]], Starz In Black was originally known as '''BET Movies: Starz! (3)''' until 2001, when BET opted out of the venture during its purchase by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] (then-owner of rival premium service Showtime).

Family''' (which was launched in May 1999) and '''Starz! Kids''' (which launched over the channel space now occupied by Starz Comedy in 2003), Starz Kids & Family features commercial-free family movies – including action and adventure movies, dramas and comedies, along with some animated and imported live-action children's series. The channel features two program blocks: "Building Blocks", a weekday morning block of animated series (primarily imported from [[Canada]]) and "Six Block", a weekday afternoon block of imported live-action series aimed at a youth audience. Unlike Starz Encore Family (which replaced Encore Wam in August 2011), Starz Kids & Family features some PG-13 rated films within its schedule, in addition to G- and PG-rated films. Due to its family-targeted format, the network broadcasts without R or NC-17 rated movies or TV-MA rated programming, only showing programs that are rated G, PG or PG-13 (or the [[TV Parental Guidelines|equivalent]] TV-G, TV-PG or TV-14).

Despite being a premium service, cable providers have occasionally used Starz Kids & Family (and its predecessor, Starz Family) to temporarily replace [[television station]]s dropped due to [[carriage dispute]]s such as during [[Journal Broadcast Group]]'s 2013 dispute with [[Time Warner Cable]]. This dispute resulted in TWC's systems in certain markets substituting other stations (such as the [[AccuWeather Channel|Local AccuWeather Channel]]- and [[Live Well Network]]-affiliated [[digital subchannel]]s of [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin's [[WTMJ-TV]]) with the channel.<ref>{{cite news|title=GSN now in WTMJ-TV's slot on Time Warner Cable|url=http://onmilwaukee.com/movies/articles/timewarnergsn.html|author=Steve Kabelowsky|date=August 15, 2013|work=[[OnMilwaukee.com]]|accessdate=February 1, 2014|archive-date=February 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202214914/http://onmilwaukee.com/movies/articles/timewarnergsn.html|url-status=live}}</ref> A January 2000 dispute between [[Cox Communications]] and [[Fox Television Stations]] resulted in Starz!

In September 2016, the channel brought back children's programming on a weekday morning block. The block provides programming from [[DHX Media]] (Mainly programs from the [[DIC Entertainment]] and [[Cookie Jar Group]] catalogs) and [[The Jim Henson Company]]. Programs include [[Angela Anaconda]], [[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], [[Liberty's Kids]], [[The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss]], etc. Other DHX programs airs on [[Starz Encore|Starz Encore Family]], and all the others appear on the Starz streaming mobile app.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/10/starz-targets-cord-cutters-with-40-larger-content-library-more-kids-shows/amp/|title=Starz expands, promises 40% larger content library, more kids' shows by year-end – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|access-date=2019-04-24|archive-date=2019-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424223450/https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/10/starz-targets-cord-cutters-with-40-larger-content-library-more-kids-shows/amp/|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Background====
{{see also|Starz Encore#Channels}}
In 1994, Encore launched the pay television industry's first "themed" multiplex service – seven additional movie channels that each focused on a specific genre. This was intended to include only six channels, but Encore decided to launch Starz as a competitor to HBO and Showtime after it acquired the pay-TV rights to broadcast films by Universal Studios released after 1993.<ref name="Encore Universal"/> A numbering system was used for each service to identify itself as an Encore channel, though this system was abandoned for most of the channels in 1996, with the tagline "an encore network" (which Starz! also used, albeit sparingly) being used from then until 2002. Starz continued to heavily include the "Encore 8" moniker in its main [[Station identification|IDs]], feature presentation bumpers and select bumpers until 2002, even as it transitioned into a separate channel from Encore.

The tie to Encore branding-wise continued even as Starz was given its own slate of multiplex channels in the late 1990s. The first of these to debut was Starz! 2 in 1996, maintaining a set lineup of four different movies scheduled at the same times each day (inspired by the scheduling used by [[movie theater]]s) with the slate of films changing each Friday.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encore targets China, multiplexes Starz!|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16823629.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105152853/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16823629.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|via=HighBeam Research|date=May 15, 1995|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> This was followed in 1997 by the debut of a joint venture with [[BET Networks]] called BET Movies: Starz! 3.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black films the focus of new pay channel; Black Entertainment Television and Encore Media Group create BET Movies STARZ!3|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18722093.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105152900/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18722093.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Jim McConville|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|via=HighBeam Research|date=September 30, 1996|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Two additional multiplex channels began operations in May 1999. Starz! Family carried family-oriented [[feature film|theatrical]] and [[home video]] film releases, was launched possibly in response to HBO's own family-oriented multiplex channel, HBO Family, which debuted three years earlier. The other service was Starz! Cinema, a channel featuring critically acclaimed independent films and movies outside the mainstream cinema.<ref>{{cite web|title=Starz!

Theater to better reflect its format.

The first changes made following the original rollout of the multiplex occurred in 2001, with the rebranding of BET Movies: Starz! as Black Starz! after BET withdrew from the partnership during its acquisition by Viacom (which owned rival pay service Showtime at the time) in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|title=Viacom Cements Purchase Of BET; Johnson to Remain CEO; Network To Stay in D.C.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-548590.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105155701/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-548590.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Christopher Stern|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=November 4, 2000|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> A seventh Starz multiplex channel was launched in 2004: Starz!

Kids was launched on cable systems on a case-by-case basis instead of on a broader national scale.

The entire multiplex was overhauled on March 28, 2005, as part of an extensive rebranding of the Starz and Encore services. While Encore debuted a slightly modified logo and applied the "Encore" brand to the names of its six multiplex channels, Starz underwent a more dramatic makeover, with a completely redesigned logo – which included the [[exclamation mark]] being dropped from the channel's name – and a standardized graphics package that was implemented across all of its channels (with some modifications for each channel's format).<ref name="Starz on-air look">{{cite web|title=Starz Entertainment Group Launches Most Extensive Re-Branding in TV History; All 13 Channels Get New On-Air Looks and Logos|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/starz-entertainment-group-launches-most-extensive-re-branding-in-tv-history-54352927.html|agency=PR Newswire|date=March 28, 2005|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archive-date=October 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005121933/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/starz-entertainment-group-launches-most-extensive-re-branding-in-tv-history-54352927.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Starz heats up brand iron|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-131606915.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105154002/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-131606915.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=John Dempsey|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]|via=HighBeam Research|date=March 29, 2005|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> The programming formats of several channels changed entirely: Starz!

Family were combined into a single channel called Starz Kids and Family, to make room for a new channel focusing on comedic feature films called Starz Comedy. Black Starz! also changed its name to Starz InBlack. The only multiplex channel (other than the primary feed) that retained its original name was Starz Cinema.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seeing Starz: New Look, New Nets for Premium Movie Juggernaut|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-130943770.html|periodical=CableFAX|via=HighBeam Research|date=March 28, 2005}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

The Starz multiplex has been marketed under several names over the years including the "Starz Encore Super Pak" and the "Starz Super Pak".<ref>{{cite web|title=Sie Creates Pay TV's First 'Super Pak' With 'Starz Encore Super Brand'|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sie+Creates+Pay+TV%27s+First+%27Super+Pak%27+With+%27Starz+Encore+Super...-a058274565|agency=PR Newswire|via=The Free Library|date=December 16, 1999|accessdate=April 22, 2015|archive-date=March 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305043941/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sie+Creates+Pay+TV's+First+'Super+Pak'+With+'Starz+Encore+Super...-a058274565|url-status=live}}</ref> The multiplex now has no "official" marketed name {{as of|2015|lc=y}}.

On March 28, 2016, Starz introduced a new logo and tagline, "Obsessable". This coincides with a revamp of the Starz channels effective April 5 of that year. All of Encore's channels will now take on the "Starz" brand, while Encore's main channel will be rebranded "Starz Encore", which will air reruns of Starz originals in addition to films. Starz now has 14 channels in its package.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/starz-encore-rebrand-new-logo-1201739832/|title=Starz Unveils New Logo, New Name and Programming Strategy for Encore (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Holloway|first=Daniel|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 28, 2016|accessdate=March 28, 2016|archive-date=March 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329040529/http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/starz-encore-rebrand-new-logo-1201739832/|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Starz HD====
Starz HD is a high-definition simulcast feed of Starz that broadcasts in the [[1080i]] resolution format. In addition to its main channel, Starz also operates high-definition simulcast feeds of its five multiplex channels. When it was launched in December 2003, the simulcast covered only the east and west coast feeds of the main Starz channel. An [[enhanced-definition television|enhanced-definition]] simulcast feed and a separate HD channel called Sharper Movies HD, that would have broadcast in the 1080i format and be structured similarly to the original format of sister channel Encore's MoviePlex (in which Sharper Movies would broadcast programming from each Starz channel in daily sampler blocks), were also planned. Plans for the latter service were dropped because of a lack of interest from providers to charge a premium fee for the network.<ref>{{cite web|title=Starz gives ops two HDTV options: 1080i and smaller high-resolution feeds on tap from premium programmer|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-103563058.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105154823/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-103563058.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Matt Stump|periodical=Multichannel News|via=HighBeam Research|date=June 9, 2003|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Starz shelves 'Sharper Movies' HD channel; Starz Encore Group drops plans to launch the Sharper Movies HD channel in 12/03 due to a lack of interest|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-108789018.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105154915/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-108789018.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Steve Donohue|periodical=Multichannel News|via=HighBeam Research|date=October 6, 2003|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> HD feeds of Starz Kids and Family, Starz Comedy and Starz Edge, followed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Starz Unveils Plans to Launch Three New HD Movie Channels|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/starz-unveils-plans-to-launch-three-new-hd-movie-channels-57733237.html|agency=PR Newswire|date=May 1, 2007|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archive-date=November 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119021550/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/starz-unveils-plans-to-launch-three-new-hd-movie-channels-57733237.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Starzplay name was borrowed from a prior service offered in conjunction with [[Netflix]]. It was created in 2008 after the subscription streaming service struck an agreement with Starz Entertainment to allow Netflix to sub-license rights to films from distributors that maintain output deals with the linear Starz channel for online viewing – in lieu of acquiring the digital distribution rights on its own, due to the expense of acquiring newer film titles – as Netflix is considered to be merely a "content aggregator". Because Netflix chose to sub-license digital rights through Starz instead of negotiating with the studios, [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]] threatened not to renew its output deal with Starz unless it either discontinued its deal with Netflix or paid Disney a licensing fee for digital streaming rights to its films (Netflix ended up assuming rights to most film releases by Walt Disney Studios from Starz in 2016).<ref name="Netflix Disney">{{cite news|title=Netflix to stream newer Disney movies|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2012/12/04/netflix-outbids-pay-tv-for-rights-to-disney-movies/1746037/|author=Michael Lietdke|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=December 4, 2012|accessdate=December 29, 2012|archive-date=December 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210024033/http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2012/12/04/netflix-outbids-pay-tv-for-rights-to-disney-movies/1746037/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Why Netflix Won't Be the HBO of the 21st Century|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-218957135.html|website=Defamer (Blogs on Demand)|publisher=Newstex LLC|via=HighBeam Research|date=February 15, 2010|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

On April 5, 2016, Starz launched a new app and over-the-top subscription service to compete with [[HBO Now]] and [[Showtime (TV network)#Showtime (streaming service)|Showtime]]'s OTT subscription service. The new app, which replaced the StarzPlay service, allowed users to access Starz programming regardless of whether they had a TV package or not. The Starz app also includes offline playback functionality, allowing users to download and watch content without an internet connection.<ref>{{cite news|title=Starz Launches OTT Subscription App|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/starz-launches-ott-subscription-app-403843|website=Multichannel News|date=April 5, 2016|accessdate=December 16, 2018|archive-date=December 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217111208/https://www.multichannel.com/news/starz-launches-ott-subscription-app-403843|url-status=live}}</ref>

In response to the discontinuation of StarzPlay, [[Comcast]] has blocked access to the new Starz app for [[Comcast Xfinity]] customers, forcing them to instead access the network's authenticated content through the Xfinity app and website and older StarzPlay apps on platforms such as [[Roku]]. Currently, Comcast is the only major distributor to do this.<ref>{{cite news|title=Comcast Won't Authenticate Subs for New Starz App|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/comcast-wont-authenticate-subs-new-starz-app-404340|website=Multichannel News|date=April 20, 2016|accessdate=December 16, 2018|archive-date=December 17, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217110528/https://www.multichannel.com/news/comcast-wont-authenticate-subs-new-starz-app-404340|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Starz on Amazon Video====
In the winter of 2015, [[Amazon Video]] began offering Starz and rival premium network Showtime as add-on subscriptions for their customers; the cost is $8.99 per month, after a seven-day free trial.  The content deal between Amazon and Starz not only offers the channel's current and back catalog of programming, but also movies and classic TV series currently airing on Encore and its branded networks, as well as live East Coast feeds of the Starz-branded networks and Encore.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=atv_hm_hom_5_c_h_2_htsstzfe2?_encoding=UTF8&benefitId=starzSub&node=2858778011&pf_rd_i=home&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=2337904342&pf_rd_r=1QJ12TJQN58F8EQ23F5C&pf_rd_s=center-8&pf_rd_t=12401 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-09-15 |archive-date=2016-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305112615/http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=atv_hm_hom_5_c_h_2_htsstzfe2?_encoding=UTF8&benefitId=starzSub&node=2858778011&pf_rd_i=home&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=2337904342&pf_rd_r=1QJ12TJQN58F8EQ23F5C&pf_rd_s=center-8&pf_rd_t=12401 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Television series===

====Original programming====
Starz expanded its program offerings to include some original television series by the late 1990s with five entertainment news programs and shows that focused on the making of upcoming or current feature films (such as ''Starz Movie News'' and ''Hollywood One on One''); some of these programs were also aired on Encore.

[[The Weinstein Company]], a film studio run by former Miramax heads [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]], purchased a 25% stake in Starz Media (but not the Starz parent company) on January 4, 2011, with Anchor Bay entering into a multi-year domestic distribution agreement of theatrical feature films released by The Weinstein Company and its [[Dimension Films]] subsidiary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weinsteins Buy 25% Stake In Starz Media|url=https://www.deadline.com/2011/01/weinsteins-buy-25-stake-in-starz-media/|author=Mike Fleming Jr.|website=Deadline Hollywood|publisher=Mail.com Media|date=January 4, 2011|access-date=February 19, 2020|archive-date=March 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312044441/http://www.deadline.com/2011/01/weinsteins-buy-25-stake-in-starz-media/|url-status=live}}</ref>
* As part of IDT Corporation's purchase by Starz, Starz Entertainment also acquired two animation studios: Toronto-based IDT animation studio (formerly DKP Studios), which was renamed [[Starz Animation]],<ref>{{cite web|title=New Starz studio busy on Burton's 9|url=http://playbackonline.ca/2007/09/17/starz-20070917/|website=Playback|date=September 17, 2007|accessdate=February 25, 2011|archive-date=April 29, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429194612/http://playbackonline.ca/2007/09/17/starz-20070917/|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Manga Entertainment]], an international distributor of Japanese animation. A third animation studio that was also acquired due to the IDT purchase, Film Roman, was sold in October 2010 to a production company owned by a group of investors led by former Film Roman studio president Scott Greenberg called Bento Box Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|title='Simpsons' animation studio Film Roman sold to group led by its ex-president|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/10/film-roman-animation-studio-simpsons.html|author=Ben Fritz|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 11, 2010|access-date=February 25, 2011|archive-date=February 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201071443/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/10/film-roman-animation-studio-simpsons.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Branding==
Starz's logo has incorporated a star in some form since its launch. In the original logo that was used from its launch in February 1994 until March 27, 2005, the star was composed of a two silhouettes (one star being embedded within a larger one), and a "'''STARZ!'''" logotype styled after 1930s-era movie poster typography. The original accompanying graphics were set around a CGI movie theater, with the main network ID featuring seats that opened by themselves, various theater imagery and even images resembling the [[Caduceus]],<ref>{{YouTube|title=Starz! Pre-Launch Promo Loop (from 1994)|id=dZpl9kJnTMM}}</ref> while feature presentation bumpers also heavily used the movie theater themes (using spotlights and film canisters) and the "Encore 8" branding. The "theater" look that had been used since the network's launch was ultimately abandoned in May 2002, when it switched to a package based around natural themes (particularly water); a seven-note fanfare was also introduced as a musical motif;<ref>{{YouTube|title=Starz Ads (Amelie and Casino)|id=G8584uCXQro}}</ref> the new look did not carry over to the multiplex channels. Starz! also introduced the "InfoBar", a lower-third banner graphic that appears on-screen during promotional breaks and during the [[Closing credits|end credits]] of films seen on the channel, originally purposed to promote upcoming programs.

This logo was abandoned for an abstract star shooting upwards and a [[Helvetica|Helvetica Neue]] wordmark in March 2005 as part of a major rebrand of the network<ref name="Starz on-air look"/> that included a blue colored gel standardized graphics package with modifications (different colors such as grey, red, green, purple, and orange) for each multiplex channel; the fanfare from the previous graphics package was also reorchestrated. The "InfoBar" also began to be used to promote events on the other Starz networks and to provide entertainment news headlines supplied by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (a similar version was adopted for use by the Encore networks). That year, Starz began branding its feature film content with an opaque logo bug appearing on the lower-right corner of the screen for two minutes each half-hour, though the 2005 logo bug for Starz channels appears for the rest of the movie's run in Summer 2007, along with Encore and Movieplex channels until Starz reverted them back to 2 minutes for their logo bug during the April 2008 rebrand, except for Encore, Movieplex, and Starz Cinema; the addition of the on-screen logos was cited by former Starz president Tom Southwick due to a large number of subscribers not knowing which of the channels they were watching when they tuned in, particularly if started viewing one of the channels after the start of a film.

A new logo was introduced in April 2008, with lowercase "'''starz'''" typing featuring an [[asteroid]]-shaped star inserted between the "a" and "r"; the coloring of the logo was modified to an orange/gold rendering in April 2011. The channel replaced the opaque on-screen logos with a bright white logo bug on all channels and a bright orange bug for Starz HD as of April 7, 2008 and Starz Kids & Family's HD simulcast feed in July 2011. After the 2011 logo rebrand, the bright white version of the 2008 logo for Starz channels stayed on screen for the second time until mid-2013 that it will reverted to two-minute version, along with Encore channels. After the current logo's introduction, the "InfoBar" began to once again serve only to promote programming on the main Starz channel, while it serves mainly as a network ID on some of its multiplex channels.

In 2016, Starz redesigned its logo again; the current logo is the word "'''STARZ'''" in bold white capital letters against a black background.
