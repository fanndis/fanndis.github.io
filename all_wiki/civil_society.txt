'''Civil society''' can be understood as the "third sector" of society, distinct from government and business, and including the family and the private sphere.<ref name=CSI>[http://www.civilsoc.org/whatisCS.htm ''What is Civil Society''] civilsoc.org {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502111725/http://www.civilsoc.org/whatisCS.htm |date=2 May 2009 }}</ref> By other authors, ''civil society'' is used in the sense of 
1) the aggregate of non-governmental organizations and institutions that manifest interests and will of citizens or 
2) individuals and organizations in a society which are independent of the government.<ref name=diccom>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/civil+society?r=66|title=Civil society – Define Civil society at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}</ref>

Sometimes the term ''civil society'' is used in the more general sense of "the elements such as freedom of speech, an independent judiciary, etc, that make up a democratic society" (''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/civil-society|title=Civil society definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref> Especially in the discussions among thinkers of Eastern and Central Europe, civil society is seen also as a [[normative]] concept of civic values.

==Etymology==
The term ''civil society'' goes back to [[Aristotle]]'s phrase ''koinōnía politikḗ'' (κοινωνία πολιτική), occurring in his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', where it refers to a ‘political community’, commensurate with the Greek [[city-state]] (''polis'') characterized by a shared set of norms and [[ethos]], in which free citizens on an equal footing lived under the [[rule of law]]. The ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' or end of civil society, thus defined, was [[eudaimonia]] (τὸ εὖ ζῆν ''tò eu zēn'') (often translated as human flourishing or common well-being), in as man was defined as a ‘political (social) animal’ (ζῷον πολιτικόν ''zōon politikón'').<ref>Aristotle, ''Politics'', Bk. 1 passim, esp. 1252a1–6</ref><ref name="Cohen">Jean L. Cohen,''Civil Society and Political Theory,'' MIT Press, 1994 pp. 84–85.</ref><ref>Bruno Blumenfeld ''The Political Paul: Democracy and Kingship in Paul's Thought,'' Sheffield Academic Press, 2001 pp. 45–83</ref><ref>Michael Davis,''The Politics of Philosophy: A Commentary on Aristotle's Politics,'' Rowman & Littlefield 1996 pp. 15–32</ref> The concept was used by Roman writers, such as [[Cicero]], where it referred to the ancient notion of a [[republic]] (''res publica''). It re-entered into Western political discourse following one of the late medieval translations of Aristotle's ''Politics'' into Latin by [[Leonardo Bruni]] who as a first translated ''koinōnía politikḗ'' into ''societas civilis''. With the rise of a distinction between monarchical autonomy and public law, the term then gained currency to denote the corporate estates (''Ständestaat'') of a feudal elite of land-holders as opposed to the powers exercised by the prince.<ref name="Cohen p.86">Jean L. Cohen,''Civil Society and Political Theory,'' MIT Press, 1994 p. 86.</ref> It had a long history in state theory, and was revived with particular force in recent times, in Eastern Europe, where dissidents such as [[Václav Havel]] as late as in the 1990s employed it to denote the sphere of civic associations threatened by the intrusive holistic state-dominated regimes of Communist Eastern Europe.<ref>Frederick W. Powell,''The Politics of Civil Society: Neoliberalism Or Social Left?,'' Policy Press, 2007. pp. 119–20, 148–49.</ref> The first post-modern usage of civil society as denoting political opposition stems from writings of [[Aleksander Smolar]] in 1978–79.<ref name="ReferenceA">Pawel Stefan Zaleski, ''Neoliberalizm i spoleczenstwo obywatelskie (Neoliberalism and Civil Society)'', Wydawnictwo UMK, Torun 2012</ref> However the term was not in use by [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] labor union in 1980–1981.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Democracy==
The literature on relations between civil society and democratic [[state (polity)|political society]] have their roots in [[classical liberal]] writings of [[G.W.F. Hegel]] from whom they were adapted by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],<ref name="zaleski" /> [[Karl Marx]], and [[Ferdinand Tönnies]]. They were developed in significant ways by 20th century researchers [[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]], who identified the role of political culture in a democratic order as vital.<ref name="ReferenceB">Almond, G., & Verba, S.; 'The Civic Culture: Political Attitudes And Democracy In Five Nations; 1989; Sage</ref>

They argued that the political element of political organizations facilitates better awareness and a more informed citizenry, who make better voting choices, participate in politics, and hold government more accountable as a result.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The statutes of these political organizations have been considered micro-constitutions because they accustom participants to the formalities of democratic decision making.

More recently, [[Robert D. Putnam]] has argued that even non-political organizations in civil society are vital for democracy. This is because they build [[social capital]], trust and shared values, which are transferred into the political sphere and help to hold society together, facilitating an understanding of the interconnectedness of society and interests within it.<ref>{{cite book | author = Robert D.

Others, however, have questioned the link between civil society and robust democracy.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Encarnación|first=Omar G.|date=2003|title=The Myth of Civil Society|language=en-gb|doi=10.1057/9781403981646|isbn=978-1-349-52686-4}}</ref> Some have noted that the civil society actors have now obtained a remarkable amount of political [[Power (philosophy)|power]] without anyone directly electing or appointing them.<ref name="globall" /><ref>Agnew, John; 2002; 'Democracy and Human Rights' in Johnston, R.J., Taylor, Peter J. and Watts, Michael J.

==Constitutional economics==
[[Constitutional economics]] is a field of [[economics]] and [[constitutionalism]] which describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and functioning of the economy including [[budget process]]. The term "constitutional economics" was used by American economist [[James M. Buchanan]] as a name for a new [[budget]] planning and the latter's [[transparency in government|transparency]] to the civil society, are of the primary guiding importance to the implementation of the [[rule of law]]. Also, the availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive [[Impoundment of appropriated funds|impoundment]] of any previously authorized appropriations, becomes a key element for the success of any influential civil society.<ref>Peter Barenboim, Natalya Merkulova.

==Global==
[[File:Civil Brainbar (1).jpg|thumb|Civil lecture at Budapest Brainbar]]
Critics and activists currently often apply the term ''civil society'' to the domain of social life which needs to be protected against [[globalization]], and to the sources of resistance thereto, because it is seen as acting beyond boundaries and across different territories.<ref>Mann, Michael; 1984; "The Autonomous Power of The State: Its Origins, Mechanisms and Results"; ''European Journal of Sociology'' 25: pp. 185–213</ref> However, as civil society can, under many definitions, include and be funded and directed by those businesses and institutions (especially donors linked to European and Northern states) who support [[globalization]], this is a contested use.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/partners/civil_society/home.htm|title=NGOs NGO civil society partnerships UN United Nations|work=un.org}}</ref> Rapid development of civil society on the global scale after the fall of the communist system was a part of neo-liberal strategies linked to the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name="globall" /> Some studies have also been published, which deal with unresolved issues regarding the use of the term in connection with the impact and conceptual power of the international aid system (see for example Tvedt 1998).

On the other hand, others see [[globalization]] as a social phenomenon expanding the sphere of [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] values, which inevitably led to a larger role for civil society at the expense of politically derived state institutions.

The integrated Civil Society Organizations (iCSO) System,<ref>[http://esango.un.org/civilsociety/login.do The integrated Civil Society Organizations (iCSO) System]</ref> developed by the [[Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] (DESA), facilitates interactions between civil society organizations and DESA.<ref>{{cite av media|url=http://vimeo.com/44625148|title=Basta! Rio+20 Walkout|work=Vimeo}}</ref>

Civil Societies also have become involved in the environmental policy making process.  These groups impact the environmental policies by setting an agenda on fixing the harms done to the environment. They also get the public informed about environmental issues, which increases the public demand for environmental change.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dodge|first1=Jennifer|title=Civil society organizations and deliberative policy making: interpreting environmental controversies in the deliberative system|journal=Policy Sciences|date=5 June 2014|volume=47|issue=2|pages=161–185|doi=10.1007/s11077-014-9200-y}}</ref>

==History==
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
From a historical perspective, the actual meaning of the concept of civil society has changed twice from its original, classical form. The first change occurred after the French Revolution, the second during the fall of communism in Europe.

===Western antiquity===
The concept of civil society in its pre-modern [[classical republicanism|classical republican]] understanding is usually connected to the early-modern thought of [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century.  However, it has much older history in the realm of political thought. Generally, civil society has been referred to as a political association governing social conflict through the imposition of rules that restrain citizens from harming one another.<ref name = "Ed6">Edwards 2004. p. 6.</ref> In the classical period, the concept was used as a synonym for the good society, and seen as indistinguishable from the state. For instance, [[Socrates]] taught that conflicts within society should be resolved through public argument using ‘[[dialectic]]’, a form of rational dialogue to uncover truth. According to Socrates, public argument through ‘dialectic’ was imperative to ensure ‘civility’ in the polis and ‘good life’ of the people.<ref name = "O'Connell">O'Connell 1999</ref> For [[Plato]], the ideal state was a just society in which people dedicate themselves to the common good, practice civic virtues of wisdom, courage, moderation and justice, and perform the occupational role to which they were best suited. It was the duty of the ‘[[philosopher king]]’ to look after people in civility. [[Aristotle]] thought the polis was an ‘association of associations’ that enables citizens to share in the virtuous task of ruling and being ruled.<ref name = "Ed6"/> His ''koinonia politike'' as political [[community]].

The concept of ''societas civilis'' is Roman and was introduced by [[Cicero]]. The political discourse in the classical period, places importance on the idea of a ‘good society’ in ensuring peace and order among the people. The philosophers in the classical period did not make any distinction between the state and society. Rather they held that the state represented the civil form of society and ‘civility’ represented the requirement of good citizenship.<ref name = "Ed6"/> Moreover, they held that human beings are inherently rational so that they can collectively shape the nature of the society they belong to. In addition, human beings have the capacity to voluntarily gather for the common cause and maintain peace in society. By holding this view, we can say that classical political thinkers endorsed the genesis of civil society in its original sense.

The [[Middle Ages]] saw major changes in the topics discussed by political philosophers. Due to the unique political arrangements of [[feudalism]], the concept of classical civil society practically disappeared from mainstream discussion. Instead conversation was dominated by problems of [[Just War|just war]], a preoccupation that would last until the end of [[Renaissance]].

===Early modern history===
The [[Thirty Years' War]] and the subsequent [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]] heralded the birth of [[Westphalian sovereignty|the sovereign states system]]. The Treaty endorsed states as territorially-based political units having sovereignty. As a result, the monarchs were able to exert domestic control by circumventing the feudal lords by raising their own armed troops.<ref name = "Bro70">Brown 2001:70{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}</ref> Henceforth, monarchs could form national armies and deploy a professional bureaucracy and fiscal departments, which enabled them to maintain direct control and authority over their subjects. In order to meet administrative expenditures, monarchs exerted greater control over the economy. This gave birth to [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]].<ref name = "Knut80">Knutsen 1997:80–118{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}</ref> Until the mid-eighteenth century, absolutism was the hallmark of Europe.<ref name = "Knut80"/>

The absolutist concept of the state was disputed in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period.<ref name = "Chand88">Chandhoke 1995:88{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}</ref>  As a natural consequence of Renaissance, Humanism, and the scientific revolution, the Enlightenment thinkers raised fundamental questions such as "What legitimacy does heredity confer?", "Why are governments instituted?", "Why do some human beings have more basic rights than others?", and so on. These questions led them to make certain assumptions about the nature of the human mind, the sources of political and [[moral authority]], the reasons behind absolutism, and how to move beyond absolutism. The Enlightenment thinkers believed in the power of the human mind to reason. They opposed the alliance between the state and the Church as the enemy of human progress and well-being because the coercive apparatus of the state curbed individual liberty and the Church legitimated monarchs by positing the theory of divine origin. Therefore, both were deemed to be against the will of the people.

Strongly influenced by the atrocities of Thirty Years' War, the political philosophers of the time held that social relations should be ordered in a different way from [[natural law]] conditions. Some of their attempts led to the emergence of [[social contract]] theory that contested social relations existing in accordance with human nature. They held that human nature can be understood by analyzing objective realities and natural law conditions. Thus they endorsed that the nature of human beings should be encompassed by the contours of state and established [[positive law]]s. [[Thomas Hobbes]] underlined the need of a powerful state to maintain civility in society. For Hobbes, human beings are motivated by self-interests (Graham 1997:23). Moreover, these self-interests are often contradictory in nature. Therefore, in [[state of nature]], there was a condition of a war of all against all. In such a situation, life was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short" (Ibid: 25). Upon realizing the danger of anarchy, human beings became aware of the need of a mechanism to protect them. As far as Hobbes was concerned, rationality and self-interests persuaded human beings to combine in agreement, to surrender sovereignty to a common power (Kaviraj 2001:289).{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}} Hobbes called this common power, state, [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]].

[[John Locke]] had a similar concept to Hobbes about the political condition in England. It was the period of the Glorious Revolution, marked by the struggle between the divine right of the Crown and the political rights of Parliament. This influenced Locke to forge a social contract theory of a limited state and a powerful society. In Locke's view, human beings led also an unpeaceful life in the state of nature. However, it could be maintained at the sub-optimal level in the absence of a sufficient system (Brown 2001:73). From that major concern, people gathered together to sign a contract and constituted a common public authority. Nevertheless, Locke held that the consolidation of political power can be turned into autocracy, if it is not brought under reliable restrictions (Kaviraj 2001:291). Therefore, Locke set forth two treaties on government with reciprocal obligations. In the first treaty, people submit themselves to the common public authority. This authority has the power to enact and maintain laws. The second treaty contains the limitations of authority, i. e., the state has no power to threaten the basic rights of human beings. As far as Locke was concerned, the basic rights of human beings are the preservation of life, liberty and property. Moreover, he held that the state must operate within the bounds of civil and natural laws.

Both Hobbes and Locke had set forth a system, in which peaceful coexistence among human beings could be ensured through social pacts or contracts. They considered civil society as a community that maintained civil life, the realm where civic virtues and rights were derived from natural laws. However, they did not hold that civil society was a separate realm from the state. Rather, they underlined the co-existence of the state and civil society. The systematic approaches of Hobbes and Locke (in their analysis of social relations) were largely influenced by the experiences in their period. Their attempts to explain human nature, natural laws, the social contract and the formation of government had challenged the divine right theory. In contrast to divine right, Hobbes and Locke claimed that humans can design their political order. This idea had a great impact on the thinkers in the Enlightenment period.

The Enlightenment thinkers argued that human beings are rational and can shape their destiny. Hence, no need of an absolute authority to control them. Both [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], a critic of civil society, and [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that people are peace lovers and that wars are the creation of absolute regimes (Burchill 2001:33). As far as Kant was concerned, this system was effective to guard against the domination of a single interest and check the tyranny of the majority (Alagappa 2004:30).

===Modern history===

{{Communitarianism sidebar}}

[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]<ref>Hegel, G. W. F. (1821), [[Elements of the Philosophy of Right|''PR'']] [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prethica.htm#PR157 § 157]</ref> completely changed the meaning of civil society, giving rise to a modern [[liberalism|liberal]] understanding of it as a form of [[free market|non-]]<nowiki/>political society as opposed to institutions of modern [[nation state]].<ref name="zaleski">{{cite journal  | last = Zaleski  | first = Pawel Stefan  | title = Tocqueville on Civilian Society.

Unlike his predecessors, Hegel considered civil society ({{lang-de|bürgerliche Gesellschaft}}) as a separate realm, a "system of needs", that is the, "[stage of] difference which intervenes between the family and the state."<ref>Hegel, G. F. W., ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', edited by [[Allen W. Wood]] (Cambridge University Press, 1991), §184</ref> Civil society is the realm of economic relationships as it exists in the modern industrial capitalist society,<ref>Stillman, Peter G. ''Hegel’s Civil Society: A Locus of Freedom'', appearing in Polity, Vol. 12, No. 4 (Summer 1980), pp. 622–46. p. 623</ref> for it had emerged at the particular period of capitalism and served its interests: individual rights and private property.<ref>Dhanagare 2001:169{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}</ref> Hence, he used the German term "bürgerliche Gesellschaft" to denote civil society as "civilian society" – a sphere regulated by the [[civil code]]. This new way of thinking about civil society was followed by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and [[Karl Marx]] as well.<ref name="zaleski" /> For Hegel, civil society manifested contradictory forces. Being the realm of capitalist interests, there is a possibility of conflicts and inequalities within it (ex: mental and physical aptitude, talents and financial circumstances). He argued that these inequalities influence the choices that members are able to make in relation to the type of work they will do. The diverse positions in Civil Society fall into three estates: the substantial estate (agriculture), the formal estate (trade and industry), and the universal estate (civil society).<ref>Hegel, G. F. W., ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', edited by Allen W. Wood (Cambridge University Press, 1991), §202</ref> A man is able to choose his estate, though his choice is limited by the aforementioned inequalities. However, Hegel argues that these inequalities enable all estates in Civil Society to be filled, which leads to a more efficient system on the whole.

[[Karl Marx]] followed the Hegelian way of using the concept of civil society. For Marx, the emergence of the modern state created a realm of civil society that reduced society to private interests competing against each other. Political society was autonomised into the state, which was in turn ruled by the bourgeois class (consider also that suffrage only belonged, then, to propertied men). Marx, in his early writings, anticipated the abolition of the separation between state and civil society, and looked forward to the reunification of private and public/political realms (Colletti, 1975). Hence, Marx rejected the positive role of state put forth by Hegel. Marx argued that the state cannot be a neutral problem solver. Rather, he depicted the state as the defender of the interests of the bourgeoisie. He considered the state to be the executive arm of the bourgeoisie, which would wither away once the working class took democratic control of society.<ref>See [[V. I. Lenin]], ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'', (2010), for a summary of Marx's thought on the State and an introduction to Marxist thought on the state up until 1917. For a detailed discussion of Marx's thought on the state and civil society see Draper, 1977 & 1986 (Volumes 1 and 2)</ref>

The above view about civil society was criticised by [[Antonio Gramsci]] (Edwards 2004:10). Departing somewhat from Marx, Gramsci did not consider civil society as a realm of private and alienated relationships. Rather, Gramsci viewed civil society as the vehicle for bourgeois hegemony, when it just represents a particular class. He underlined the crucial role of civil society as the contributor of the cultural and ideological capital required for the survival of the hegemony of capitalism.<ref>Ehrenberg 1999:208</ref> Rather than posing it as a problem, as in earlier Marxist conceptions, Gramsci viewed civil society as the site for problem-solving. Misunderstanding Gramsci, the [[New Left]] assigned civil society a key role in defending people against the state and the market and in asserting the democratic will to influence the state.<ref>Ehrenberg 1999:30</ref> At the same time, neo-liberal thinkers consider civil society as a site for struggle to subvert Communist and authoritarian regimes.<ref>Ehrenberg 1999:33</ref> Thus, the term civil society occupies an important place in the political discourses of the New Left and neo-liberals.

===Post-modern history===
[[File:Nemzeti Ünnep - Kossuth tér 1989.03.15 (6).jpg|thumb|After decades of forbidden national days, on the 15th of March, 1989, the communist regime of Hungary allowed people to celebrate the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 revolution]]. Parallel with the state celebration at the National Museum, independent organisations called the public to gather at the statue of [[Petőfi Sándor]].]]
It is commonly believed{{by whom|date=August 2018}} that the post-modern way of understanding civil society was first developed by political opposition in the former Soviet bloc East European countries in the 1980s. However, research shows that communist [[propaganda]] had the most important influence on the development and popularization of the idea instead, in an effort to legitimize [[neo-liberalism|neoliberal]] transformation in 1989.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> According to theory of restructurization of welfare systems, a new way of using the concept of civil society became a [[neo-liberalism|neoliberal]] [[ideology]] legitimizing development of the third sector as a substitute for the [[welfare state]]. The recent development of the third sector is a result of this welfare systems restructuring, rather than of democratization.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

From that time stems a political practice of using the idea of civil society instead of [[State (polity)|political society]]. Henceforth, postmodern usage of the idea of civil society became divided into two main ones: as political society and as the third sector – apart from plethora of definitions.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> The [[Washington Consensus]] of the 1990s, which involved conditioned loans by the World Bank and IMF to debt-laden developing states, also created pressures for states in poorer countries to shrink.<ref name="globall" /> This in turn led to practical changes for civil society that went on to influence the theoretical debate. Initially the new conditionality led to an even greater emphasis on "civil society" as a panacea, replacing the state's service provision and social care,<ref name="globall">Pawel Stefan Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz & Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making," IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006 [http://zaleski.wex.pl/2006%20global%20nongovernmental%20administrative%20system.pdf]</ref> Hulme and Edwards suggested that it was now seen as "the magic bullet."

By the end of the 1990s civil society was seen less as a panacea amid the growth of the [[anti-globalization movement]] and the transition of many countries to democracy; instead, civil society was increasingly called on to justify its legitimacy and democratic credentials. This led to the creation by the UN of a high level panel on civil society.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.un.org/reform/civilsociety/bios.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002044238/http://www.un.org/reform/civilsociety/bios.shtml |archive-date=2 October 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |df=dmy-all }}</ref> However, in the 1990s with the emergence of the nongovernmental organizations and the [[new social movements]] (NSMs) on a global scale, civil society as a [[Voluntary sector|third sector]] became treated as a key terrain of strategic action to construct ‘an alternative social and world order.’ Post-modern civil society theory has now largely returned to a more neutral stance, but with marked differences between the study of the phenomena in richer societies and writing on civil society in developing states.

==Link to the public sphere==
[[Jürgen Habermas]] said that the [[public sphere]] encourages rational will-formation; it is a sphere of rational and democratic social interaction.<ref>Habermas, J. (1974). The public sphere: an encyclopaedia article. ''New German Critique'', 3, 49–55.</ref> Habermas analyzes civil society as a sphere of "commodity exchange and social labor" and public sphere as a part of political realm. Habermas argues that even though society was representative of capitalist society, there are some institutions that were part of political society. Transformations in economy brought transformations to the public sphere. Though these transformations happen, a civil society develops into political society when it emerges as non-economic and has a populous aspect, and when the state is not represented by just one political party. There needs to be a locus of authority, and this is where society can begin to challenge authority. Jillian Schwedler points out that civil society emerges with the resurrection of the public sphere when individuals and groups begin to challenge boundaries of permissible behaviour – for example, by speaking out against the regime or demanding a government response to social needs – civil society begins to take shape.<ref>Schwedler, 1995:5{{full citation needed|date=June 2014}}</ref>
