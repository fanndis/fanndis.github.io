The '''prime minister of Australia''' is the [[head of government]] of [[Australia]]. The prime minister is the leader of the [[Australian Government|federal government]] and is also accountable to [[Parliament of Australia|federal parliament]] under the principles of [[responsible government]]. The incumbent prime minister is [[Scott Morrison]], who took office in August 2018 as leader of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]].

Formally appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|governor-general]], the office of the prime minister is governed by [[Westminster system]] convention as it is not described in the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]]. To become prime minister, a politician of the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] must be able to [[Confidence and supply|command the confidence]] of the chamber. As such, the prime minister is typically the leader of the majority [[Political parties of Australia|party]] or [[Coalition government|coalition]]. Prime ministers do not have a [[term of office|set duration]] or [[term limits|number of terms]], but an individual's term generally ends when their political party loses a [[Elections in Australia|federal election]], or they lose or relinquish the leadership of their party.

[[Executive power]] is formally vested in the [[Monarchy of Australia|monarch]] and exercised by the governor-general on advice from government ministers, who are nominated by the prime minister and form the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]]. The most senior ministers form the [[Cabinet of Australia|federal cabinet]], which the prime minister chairs. The prime minister also heads the [[National Cabinet (Australia)|National Cabinet]] and the [[National Security Committee (Australia)|National Security Committee]]. Administrative support is provided by the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]. The prime minister has two official residences: [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]] in [[Canberra]] and [[Kirribilli House]] in [[Sydney]], as well as an office at [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]].

[[List of prime ministers of Australia|Thirty people]] have served as prime minister, the first of whom was [[Edmund Barton]] taking office on 1 January 1901 following [[Federation of Australia|federation]]. The [[List of prime ministers of Australia by time in office|longest-serving]] prime minister was [[Robert Menzies]], who served over 18 years, and the short-serving was [[Frank Forde]], who served one week. There is no legislative [[line of succession]], however convention determines that the governor-general shall commission the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|deputy prime minister]] on a [[Caretaker government|caretaker]] basis.

==Constitutional basis and appointment==
{{Politics of Australia sidebar}}
[[File:Australian House of Reps 1901.jpg|thumb|left|Australia's first prime minister, [[Edmund Barton]] at the central table in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] in 1901.]]
The prime minister of Australia is appointed by the governor-general of Australia under Section 64 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]], which empowers the governor-general, as the official representative of the [[Monarchy of Australia|Crown]], to appoint government ministers of state on the advice of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]], and requires them to be members of the House of Representatives or the Senate, or become members within three months of the appointment. The prime minister and [[Treasurer of Australia|treasurer]] are traditionally members of the House, but the Constitution does not have such a requirement.<ref name="senatebrief14">{{Cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Senate_Briefs/Brief14 |title=No. 14 - Ministers in the Senate |date=December 2016 |website=Senate Briefs |publisher=Parliament of Australia}}</ref> Before being sworn in as a [[Minister of the Crown|Minister of State]], a person must first be sworn in as a member of the Federal Executive Council if they are not already a member. Membership of the Federal Executive Council entitles the member to the style of ''The Honourable'' (usually abbreviated to ''The Hon'') for life, barring exceptional circumstances. The senior members of the Executive Council constitute the [[Cabinet of Australia]].

The prime minister is, like other ministers, normally sworn in by the governor-general and then presented with the commission ([[letters patent]]) of office. When defeated in an election, or on resigning, the prime minister is said to "hand in the commission" and actually does so by returning it to the governor-general. In the event of a prime minister dying in office, or becoming incapacitated, or for other reasons, the governor-general can terminate the commission. Ministers hold office "during the pleasure of the governor-general" (s. 64 of the Constitution of Australia), so theoretically, the governor-general can dismiss a minister at any time, by notifying them in writing of the termination of their commission; however, their power to do so except on the advice of the prime minister is heavily circumscribed by convention.

According to convention, the prime minister is the leader of the majority party or largest party in a coalition of parties in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|House of Representatives]] which holds the confidence of the House. Some commentators argue that the governor-general may also dismiss a prime minister who is unable to pass the government's supply bill through both houses of parliament, including the [[Australian Senate]], where the government doesn't normally command the majority, as happened in the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975 constitutional crisis]].<ref name=kerr>{{cite web|last1=Kerr|first1=John|title=Statement from John Kerr (dated 11 November 1975) explaining his decisions.|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|website=WhitlamDismissal.com|accessdate=11 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223060041/http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|archive-date=23 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other commentators argue that the governor-general acted improperly in 1975 as Whitlam still retained the confidence of the House of Representatives, and there are no generally accepted conventions to guide the use of the governor-general's reserve powers in this circumstance.<ref name="auto">{{cite book|title=Australia's Constitution : With Overview and Notes by the Australian Government Solicitor.|date=2010|publisher=Parliamentary Education Office and Australian Government Solicitor|location=Canberra|isbn=9781742293431|page=v|edition= Pocket|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Constitution.aspx}}</ref> However, there is no constitutional requirement that the prime minister sit in the House of Representatives, or even be a member of the federal parliament (subject to a constitutionally prescribed limit of three months), though by convention this is always the case. The only case where a member of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] was appointed Prime Minister was [[John Gorton]], who subsequently resigned his Senate position and was elected as a member of the House of Representatives.

Despite the importance of the office of Prime Minister, the Constitution does not mention the office by name. The conventions of the [[Westminster system]] were thought to be sufficiently entrenched in Australia by the authors of the Constitution that it was deemed unnecessary to detail these.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Indeed, prior to Federation in 1901 the terms "premier" and "prime minister" were used interchangeably for the head of government in a colony.<ref>{{cite news  |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/page/18494769
|title=The Premiers' Conference - Text of the Resolutions
|newspaper=[[The Age]]
|accessdate=5 December 2019 
|date=23 August 1898}}</ref>

If a government cannot get its appropriation (budget) legislation passed by the House of Representatives, or the House passes a vote of "no confidence" in the government, the prime minister is bound by convention to immediately advise the governor-general to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a fresh election.

Following a resignation in other circumstances or the death of a prime minister, the governor-general generally appoints the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|deputy prime minister]] as the new prime minister, until or if such time as the governing party or senior coalition party elects an alternative party leader. This has resulted in the party leaders from the Country Party (now named National Party) being appointed as Prime Minister, despite being the smaller party of their coalition. This occurred when [[Earle Page]] became caretaker prime minister following the death of [[Joseph Lyons]] in 1939, and when [[John McEwen]] became caretaker prime minister following the [[disappearance of Harold Holt]] in 1967. However, in 1941, [[Arthur Fadden]] became the leader of the Coalition and subsequently Prime Minister by the agreement of both coalition parties, despite being the leader of the smaller party in coalition, following the resignation of UAP leader Robert Menzies.

Excluding the brief transition periods during changes of government or leadership elections, there have only been a handful of cases where someone other than the leader of the majority party in the House of Representatives was Prime Minister:
* [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] occurred on 1 January 1901, but [[1901 Australian federal election|elections for the first parliament]] were not scheduled until late March. In the interim, an unelected [[caretaker government]] was necessary. In what is now known as the [[Hopetoun Blunder]], the governor-general, [[John Hope, 7th Earl of Hopetoun|Lord Hopetoun]], invited Sir [[William Lyne]], the [[Premier of New South Wales|premier]] of the most populous state, [[New South Wales]], to form a government. Lyne was unable to do so and returned his commission in favour of [[Edmund Barton]], who became the first prime minister and led the inaugural government into and beyond the election.
* During the second parliament, three parties (Free Trade, Protectionist and Labor) had roughly equal representation in the House of Representatives. The leaders of the three parties, [[Alfred Deakin]], [[George Reid]] and [[Chris Watson]] each served as Prime Minister before losing a vote of confidence.
* As a result of the [[Australian Labor Party split of 1916|Labor Party's split over conscription]], [[Billy Hughes]] and his supporters were expelled from the Labor Party in November 1916. He subsequently continued on as prime minister at the head of the new [[National Labor Party]], which had only 14 members out of a total of 75 in the House of Representatives. The [[Commonwealth Liberal Party]] – despite still forming the official Opposition – provided confidence and supply until February 1917, when the two parties agree to merge and form the [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist Party]].
* During the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975 constitutional crisis]], on 11 November 1975, the governor-general, Sir [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]], dismissed the Labor Party's [[Gough Whitlam]] as Prime Minister. Despite Labor holding a majority in the House of Representatives, Kerr appointed the Leader of the Opposition, [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] leader [[Malcolm Fraser]] as caretaker prime minister, conditional on the passage of the Whitlam government's [[Confidence and supply|Supply]] bills through the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and the calling of an election for both houses of parliament. Fraser accepted these terms and immediately advised a [[double dissolution]]. An election was called for [[1975 Australian federal election|13 December]], which the Liberal Party won in its own right (although the Liberals governed in a coalition with the Country Party).

==Powers and role==
[[Image:ac.bartonministry.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The first prime minister of Australia, Edmund Barton (sitting second from left), with his Cabinet, 1901.]]

Most of the prime minister's power derives from being the [[head of government]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Infosheet 20 - The Australian system of government|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_20_-_The_Australian_system_of_government|access-date=2020-07-30|website=Parliament of Australia|language=en-AU}}</ref> In practice, the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Federal Executive Council]] acts to ratify all executive decisions made by the government and requires the support of the prime minister. The powers of the prime minister are to direct the governor-general through advice to grant [[royal assent|Royal Assent]] to legislation, to dissolve and prorogue parliament, to call elections and to make government appointments, which the governor-general follows.

The Constitution divides power between the federal government and the states, and the prime minister is constrained by this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianpolitics.com/executive/pm/prime-minister-roles-powers-restraints|title=Prime Minister: Roles, Powers and Restraints|publisher=Australian Politics}}</ref>

The formal power to appoint the [[Governor-General of Australia|governor-general]] lies with the [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]], on the advice of the prime minister, whereby convention holds that the queen is bound to follow the advice. The prime minister can also advise the monarch to dismiss the governor-general, though it remains unclear how quickly the monarch would act on such advice in a constitutional crisis. This uncertainty, and the possibility of a "race" between the governor-general and prime minister to dismiss the other, was a key question in the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|1975 constitutional crisis]]. Prime ministers whose government loses a [[motion of no confidence|vote of no-confidence]] in the House of Representatives, are expected to advise the governor-general to dissolve parliament and hold an election, if an alternative government cannot be formed. If they fail to do this, the governor-general may by convention dissolve parliament or appoint an alternative government.<ref name=kerr>{{cite web|last1=Kerr|first1=John|title=Statement from John Kerr (dated 11 November 1975) explaining his decisions.|url=http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|website=WhitlamDismissal.com|accessdate=11 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223060041/http://whitlamdismissal.com/documents/kerr-statement.shtml|archive-date=23 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The prime minister is also the responsible minister for the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]], which is tasked with supporting the policy agendas of the prime minister and [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]] through policy advice and the coordination of the implementation of key government programs, to manage [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander]] policy and programs and to promote [[conflict resolution|reconciliation]], to provide leadership for the [[Australian Public Service]] alongside the [[Australian Public Service Commission]], to oversee the [[Australian honours system|honours]] and [[Australian royal symbols|symbols]] of the Commonwealth, to provide support to ceremonies and official visits, to set whole of government service delivery policy, and to coordinate national security, cyber, counterterrorism, regulatory reform, cities, population, data, and women's policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dpmc.gov.au/resource-centre/government/administrative-arrangements-order-1-september-2016|title=Administrative Arrangements Order|date=1 September 2016|publisher=[[Commonwealth of Australia]]|accessdate=11 January 2017|work=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet}}</ref> Since 1992, the prime minister also acts as the chair of the [[Council of Australian Governments]] (COAG), an intergovernmental forum between the federal government and the state governments in which the prime minister, the state premiers and chief ministers, and a representative of local governments meet annually.<ref>https://www.coag.gov.au/about-coag</ref>

As of 1 July 2019, Australia's prime minister is paid a total salary of $549,250. This is made up of the 'base salary' received by all Members of Parliament ($211,250) plus a 160 percent 'additional salary' for the role of prime minister.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.remtribunal.gov.au/offices/parliamentary-offices|title=Parliamentary Offices|website=Remuneration Tribunal|access-date=2 July 2019}}</ref> Increases in the base salary of MPs and senators are determined annually by the independent Remuneration Tribunal.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.remtribunal.gov.au/what-do-federal-members-parliament-get-paid|title=What do Federal Members of Parliament get paid?|website=Remuneration Tribunal|access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref>

===Residences and transport===
[[Image:Curtin GGPrinceHenry Fadden Hughes Menzies.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Prime ministers [[John Curtin|Curtin]], [[Arthur Fadden|Fadden]], [[Billy Hughes|Hughes]], [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]] and Governor-General [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|The Duke of Gloucester]] 2nd from left, in 1945.]]

While in office, the prime minister has two official residences. The primary official residence is [[The Lodge (Australia)|The Lodge]] in [[Canberra]]. Most prime ministers have chosen The Lodge as their primary residence because of its security facilities and close proximity to Parliament House. There have been some exceptions, however. [[James Scullin]] preferred to live at the [[Hotel Canberra]] (now the Hyatt Hotel) and [[Ben Chifley]] lived in the [[Hotel Kurrajong]]. More recently, [[John Howard]] used the [[Sydney]] Prime Ministerial residence, [[Kirribilli House]], as his primary accommodation. On her appointment on 24 June 2010, [[Julia Gillard]] said she would not be living in The Lodge until such time as she was returned to office by popular vote at the [[2010 Australian federal election|next general election]], as she became Prime Minister by replacing an incumbent during a parliamentary term. [[Tony Abbott]] was never able to occupy The Lodge during his term (2013–15) as it was undergoing extensive renovations, which continued into the early part of his successor [[Malcolm Turnbull]]'s term.<ref>[https://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/act/report-blames-abbott-government-for-renovation-nightmare-at-the-lodge-20170818-gxzbd9.html Canberra Times, 18 August 2017]. Retrieved 12 June 2018</ref> Instead, Abbott resided in dedicated rooms at the [[Australian Federal Police|Australian Federal Police College]] when in Canberra.

During his first term, Rudd had a staff at The Lodge consisting of a senior chef and an assistant chef, a child carer, one senior house attendant, and two junior house attendants. At [[Kirribilli House]] in Sydney, there is one full-time chef and one full-time house attendant.<ref>{{cite news|last=Metherell|first=Mark|title=Rudds' staff extends to a child carer at the Lodge|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/rudds-staff-extends-to-a-child-carer-at-the-lodge/2008/02/18/1203190740533.html|accessdate=24 June 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=19 February 2008}}</ref>
The official residences are fully staffed and catered for both the prime minister and their family. In addition, both have extensive security facilities. These residences are regularly used for official entertaining, such as receptions for [[Australian of the Year]] finalists.

The prime minister receives a number of transport amenities for official business. The [[Royal Australian Air Force]]'s [[No. 34 Squadron RAAF|No. 34 Squadron]] transports the prime minister within Australia and overseas by specially converted Boeing Business Jets and smaller Challenger aircraft. The aircraft contain secure communications equipment as well as an office, conference room and sleeping compartments. The call-sign for the aircraft is "Envoy". For ground travel, the prime minister is transported in an armoured [[BMW]] 7 Series model. It is referred to as "C-1", or Commonwealth One, because of its number plate. It is escorted by police vehicles from state and federal authorities.<ref>{{cite web|author=CarAdvice.com.au |url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/27616/over-25-of-government-car-fleet-foreign-made/ |title=25% of government car fleet foreign made |publisher=Car Advice |date=6 April 2009|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref>

===After office===
Politicians, including prime ministers, are usually granted certain privileges after leaving office, such as office accommodation, staff assistance, and a Life Gold Pass, which entitles the holder to travel within Australia for "non-commercial" purposes at government expense. In 2017, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the pass should be available only to former prime ministers, though he would not use it when he was no longer PM.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/07/malcolm-turnbull-to-scrap-life-gold-pass-for-former-mp|title=Malcolm Turnbull to scrap Life Gold Pass for former MPs|first=Gareth|last=Hutchens|date=7 February 2017|website=the Guardian}}</ref>

Only one prime minister who had left the Federal Parliament ever returned. [[Stanley Bruce]] was defeated in his own seat in [[1929 Australian federal election|1929]] while Prime Minister but was re-elected to parliament in [[1931 Australian federal election|1931]]. Other prime ministers were elected to parliaments other than the Australian federal parliament: [[George Reid|Sir George Reid]] was elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|UK House of Commons]] (after his term as High Commissioner to the UK), and [[Frank Forde]] was re-elected to the Queensland Parliament (after his term as High Commissioner to Canada, and a failed attempt to re-enter the Federal Parliament).

==Acting prime minister==
It is a convention for the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|deputy prime minister]] to serve as [[acting prime minister]] when the prime minister is travelling outside Australia or absent due to illness. If the deputy prime minister is also unavailable, another senior member of the government is appointed as acting prime minister.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://questions.peo.gov.au/questions/does-australia-have-a-parliamentary-line-of-succession-to-the-prime-minister-and-if-so-what-is-the-order/22|title=Does Australia have a parliamentary line of succession to the Prime Minister and if so, what is the order?|publisher=Parliamentary Education Office|access-date=16 December 2019}}</ref> If a prime minister is to die, disappear, or otherwise become permanently unable to act as the prime minister while in office, the governor-general, by convention, shall commission the deputy prime minister to be prime minister until the House of Representatives can determine another politician who can command the confidence of the chamber.<ref>{{Cite web|title="Does Australia have a parliamentary line of succession to the Prime Minister and if so, what is the order?"|url=https://questions.peo.gov.au/questions/does-australia-have-a-parliamentary-line-of-succession-to-the-prime-minister-and-if-so-what-is-the-order/22|access-date=23 August 2020|website=Parliamentary Education Office}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, overseas travel generally required long journeys by ship.

The greatest number of living former prime ministers at any one time was eight. This has occurred twice:
* Between 7 October 1941 (when [[John Curtin]] succeeded [[Arthur Fadden]]) and 18 November 1941 (when [[Chris Watson]] died), the eight living former prime ministers were Bruce, Cook, Fadden, Hughes, Menzies, Page, Scullin and Watson.
* Between 13 July 1945 (when [[Ben Chifley]] succeeded [[Frank Forde]]) and 30 July 1947 (when Sir [[Joseph Cook]] died), the eight living former prime ministers were Bruce, Cook, Fadden, Forde, Hughes, Menzies, Page and Scullin.
All except Cook and Bruce, as former Prime Ministers served in Parliament at the same time between Chifley succeeding Forde on 13 July 1945 and Forde losing his seat at the 1946 election.
This marks the greatest number (six) of former prime ministers serving in Parliament concurrently at any one time. 


[[Ben Chifley]] lived the least of all former prime ministers, as he died one year and six months after his term as prime minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/chifley/after-office.aspx|title=After office|work=naa.gov.au}}</ref> All other deceased former prime ministers have lived at least another 10 years, with the longest surviving former prime minister being [[Gough Whitlam]], who lived 38 years and 11 months after office, surpassing [[Stanley Bruce]]'s previous record of 37 years and 10 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apo.org.au/source/prime-minister-australia|title=Prime Minister of Australia|work=Australian Policy Online|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150917000622/http://apo.org.au/source/prime-minister-australia|archive-date=17 September 2015}}</ref>

==Honours==
Prime Ministers have been granted numerous honours, typically after their period as Prime Minister has concluded, with a few exceptions. Prime Ministers were awarded honours within the [[British honours system]] before 1975, when appointment to the [[Order of Australia]] began. Only one former Prime Minister, John Howard, has been awarded a British Honour since 1975, being the [[Order of Merit]] (within the Queen's personal gift) in 2012.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=60028|page=485|date=12 January 2012}}</ref>

In almost all occasions these honours were only accepted by non-Labor/conservative Prime Ministers.

The longest-serving prime minister was Sir [[Robert Menzies]], who served in office twice: from 26 April 1939 to 28 August 1941, and again from 19 December 1949 to 26 January 1966. In total Robert Menzies spent 18 years, 5 months and 12 days in office. He served under the United Australia Party and the Liberal Party respectively.

The shortest-serving prime minister was [[Frank Forde]], who was appointed to the position on 6 July 1945 after the death of [[John Curtin]], and served until 13 July 1945 when [[Ben Chifley]] was elected leader of the [[Australian Labor Party]].

The last prime minister to serve out a full government term in the office was [[John Howard]], who won the 2004 election and led his party to the 2007 election, but lost. Since then, the five subsequent prime ministers have been either voted out of the office mid-term by the [[caucus]]es of their own parties, assumed the office mid-term under such circumstances, or both.
