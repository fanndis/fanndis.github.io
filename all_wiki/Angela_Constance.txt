'''Angela Constance''' (born 15 July 1970) is a [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) politician who served as [[Cabinet Secretary for Communities, Social Security and Equalities]] from May 2016 to June 2018. She has been the [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) for [[Almond Valley (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Almond Valley]] since 2007, and has held a series of ministerial posts in the [[Scottish Government]] from 2010 to 2018.

Constance stood as a candidate for Deputy leader of the SNP in the [[2014 Scottish National Party leadership election|party's 2014 leadership contest]], but lost to [[Stewart Hosie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29429784|title=BBC News - Angela Constance calls on SNP to 'build' independence case|work=BBC News}}</ref>

==Early life==
Constance was born in [[Blackburn, West Lothian|Blackburn]], [[West Lothian]], the daughter of Simon Constance, a coalminer, and Mary Constance (née Colquhoun). She was raised in [[Addiewell]] and [[West Calder]]. While studying at the [[University of Glasgow]], Constance was elected President of [[Glasgow University Students' Representative Council]], where her sabbatical vice president was [[Alasdair Allan]], now SNP MSP for the Western Isles.

Before her election to [[Scottish Parliament|Holyrood]], Constance worked as a [[social worker]] and was a councillor for [[West Lothian Council]] where she was the SNP spokesperson for children's services and lifelong learning.   She also stood for the SNP in the [[2005 Livingston by-election]].

==Political career==

===Training, Youth and Women's employment===
During the 2014 SNP spring conference, First Minister and SNP leader [[Alex Salmond]] promoted Constance to the [[Scottish Cabinet]] in the position of [[Cabinet Secretary for Training, Youth and Women’s Employment]]. In the position, Constance was somewhat criticised by the opposition [[Scottish Labour Party]] in the [[Scottish Parliament]], claiming that since Constance, youth unemployment in Scotland had actually risen.<ref name="telegraph-2014-05-07-failure" /> In response to this, Constance stated:

<blockquote>These figures, based on data for 2013, show that the employment prospects are improving across much of Scotland, with women’s employment driving much of this improvement.

“They also show that Scotland continues to outperformed the UK across all headline labour market indicators, with a lower unemployment rate, higher employment rate and lower economic inactivity rate.<ref name="telegraph-2014-05-07-failure" /></blockquote>

Previously, Constance was a junior Scottish cabinet member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/benrileysmith/100267505/four-key-things-we-learnt-from-the-snp-conference/|title=Four key things we learnt from the SNP conference|work=News - Telegraph Blogs}}</ref>
