''The Inquirer'' first became a major newspaper during the [[American Civil War]] when its war coverage was popular on both sides. The paper's circulation dropped after the war, then rose by the end of the 19th century. Originally supportive of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], ''The Inquirer'''s political affiliation eventually shifted toward the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] and then the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] before officially becoming politically independent in the middle of the 20th century. By the end of the 1960s, ''The Inquirer'' trailed its chief competitor, the ''[[Philadelphia Bulletin|Philadelphia Evening Bulletin]]'', and lacked modern facilities and experienced staff. In the 1970s, [[Knight Ridder|new owners]] and editors turned the newspaper into one of the country's most prominent.

==History==
''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' was founded as ''The Pennsylvania Inquirer'' by printer John R. Walker and [[John Norvell]], former editor of Philadelphia's largest newspaper, the ''Aurora & Gazette''. An [[editorial]] in the first issue of ''The Pennsylvania Inquirer'' promised that the paper would be devoted to the right of a minority to voice their opinion and "the maintenance of the rights and liberties of the people, equally against the abuses as the usurpation of power." They pledged support to then-[[Andrew Jackson|President Andrew Jackson]] and "home industries, American manufactures, and [[internal improvements]] that so materially contribute to the agricultural, commercial and national prosperity."<ref name="Inqhistory">{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Edgar |date=June 20, 2003 |url=http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/6135296.htm?1cc |title=A history of The Inquirer |website=The Philadelphia Inquirer |accessdate=May 27, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219044935/http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/local/6135296.htm?1c |archivedate=February 19, 2007}}</ref> Founded on June 1, 1829, ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' is the third-oldest surviving daily newspaper in the United States. However, in 1962, an ''Inquirer''-commissioned historian traced ''The Inquirer'' to [[John Dunlap]]'s ''[[Pennsylvania Packet|The Pennsylvania Packet]]'', which was founded on October 28, 1771. In 1850, ''The Packet'' was merged with another newspaper, ''The North American'', which later merged with the ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Public Ledger]]''.<ref name="Pressa"/> Finally, the ''Public Ledger'' merged with ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' in the 1930s, and between 1962 and 1975, a line on ''The Inquirer'''s front page claimed that the newspaper is the United States' oldest surviving daily newspaper.<ref name="Inqhistory"/>

Six months after ''The Inquirer'' was founded, with competition from eight established daily newspapers, lack of funds forced Norvell and Walker to sell the newspaper to publisher and ''United States Gazette'' associate editor [[Jesper Harding]]. After Harding acquired ''The Pennsylvania Inquirer'', it was briefly published as an afternoon paper before returning to its original morning format in January 1830. Under Harding, in 1829, ''The Inquirer'' moved from its original location between Front and Second Streets to between Second and Third Streets. When Harding bought and merged the ''Morning Journal'' in January 1830, the newspaper was moved to South Second Street. Ten years later ''The Inquirer'' again was moved, this time to its own building at the corner of Third Street and Carter's Alley. Harding expanded ''The Inquirer'''s content and the paper soon grew into a major Philadelphian newspaper. The expanded content included the addition of fiction, and in 1840, Harding gained rights to publish several [[Charles Dickens]] novels for which Dickens was paid a significant amount. At the time the common practice was to pay little or nothing for the rights of foreign authors' works.<ref name="Inqhistory"/>

===Civil War to 1920s===
{{see also|Inquirer Building}}
[[File:Inquirerbldgfull.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Inquirer Building, formerly the Elverson Building, the home of the newspaper from 1924–2011]]
Harding retired in 1859 and was succeeded by his son William White Harding, who had become a partner three years earlier. William Harding changed the name of the newspaper to its current name, ''The Philadelphia Inquirer''. Harding, in an attempt to increase [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]], cut the price of the paper, began delivery routes and had newsboys sell papers on the street. In 1859, circulation had been around 7,000; by 1863 it had increased to 70,000. Part of the increase was due to the interest in news during the [[American Civil War]]. Twenty-five to thirty thousand copies of ''The Inquirer'' were often distributed to [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers during the war and several times the U.S. government asked ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' to issue a special edition specifically for soldiers. ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' supported the Union, but Harding wanted their coverage to remain neutral. [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] generals often sought copies of the paper, believing that the newspaper's war coverage was accurate.<ref name="Inqhistory"/>

''Inquirer'' journalist Uriah Hunt Painter was at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] in 1861, a battle which ended in a Confederate victory. Initial reports from the government claimed a Union victory, but ''The Inquirer'' went with Painter's firsthand account. Crowds threatened to burn ''The Inquirer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> building down because of the report. Another report, this time about [[George Meade|General George Meade]], angered Meade enough that he punished Edward Crapsey, the reporter who wrote it. Crapsey and other war correspondents later decided to attribute any victories of the [[Army of the Potomac]], Meade's command, to [[Ulysses S. Grant]], commander of the entire Union army. Any defeats of the Army of the Potomac would be attributed to Meade.<ref name="Inqhistory"/>

During the war, ''The Inquirer'' continued to grow with more staff being added and another move into a larger building on Chestnut Street. However, after the war, economic hits combined with Harding becoming ill, hurt ''The Inquirer''. Despite Philadelphia's population growth, distribution fell from 70,000 during the Civil War to 5,000 in 1888. Beginning in 1889, the paper was sold to publisher James Elverson. To bring back the paper, Elverson moved ''The Inquirer'' to a new building with the latest printing technology and an increased staff. The "new" ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' premiered on March 1 and was successful enough that Elverson started a Sunday edition of the paper. In 1890, in an attempt to increase circulation further, the price of ''The Inquirer'' was cut and the paper's size was increased, mostly with [[Classified advertising|classified advertisements]]. After five years ''The Inquirer'' had to move into a larger building on Market Street and later expanded into adjacent property.<ref name="Inqhistory"/>

After Elverson's death in 1911, his son by his wife Sallie Duvall, James Elverson Jr. took charge. Under Elverson Jr., the newspaper continued to grow, eventually needing to move again. Elverson Jr. bought land at [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad]] and Callowhill Streets and built the eighteen-story Elverson Building, now known as the Inquirer Building. The first ''Inquirer'' issue printed at the building came out on July 13, 1925. Elverson Jr. died a few years later in 1929 and his sister, Eleanor Elverson, Mrs. [[Jules Patenotre des Noyers|Jules Patenôtre]], took over.<ref name="Inqhistory"/>

===Annenberg years===
Eleanor Elverson Patenôtre ordered cuts throughout the paper, but was not really interested in managing it and ownership was soon put up for sale. [[Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis|Cyrus Curtis]] and [[Curtis-Martin Newspapers]] Inc. bought the newspaper on March 5, 1930.<ref>{{cite journal |date=March 17, 1930 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,738833-1,00.html |title=Again, Curtis-Martin |journal=Time }}</ref> Curtis died a year later and his stepson-in-law, [[John Charles Martin]], took charge. Martin merged ''The Inquirer'' with another paper, the ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'', but the [[Great Depression]] hurt Curtis-Martin Newspapers and the company [[Default (finance)|defaulted]] in payments of maturity notes. Subsequently, ownership of ''The Inquirer'' returned to the Patenôtre family and Elverson Corp.<ref>{{cite journal |date=August 10, 1936 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762298,00.html |title=Philadelphia Purchase |journal=Time }}</ref> Charles A. Taylor was elected president of The Inquirer Co. and ran the paper until it was sold to [[Moses Annenberg|Moses L. Annenberg]] in 1936. During the period between Elverson Jr. and Annenberg ''The Inquirer'' stagnated, its editors ignoring most of the poor economic news of the Depression. The lack of growth allowed [[J. David Stern]]'s newspaper, ''[[The Philadelphia Record]]'', to surpass ''The Inquirer'' in circulation and become the largest newspaper in Pennsylvania.<ref name="Pressa" /><ref name="Annenberg">{{cite book |last=Ogden |first=Christopher |year=1999 |title=Legacy: A Biography of Moses and Walter Annenberg |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York |isbn=0-316-63379-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/legacybiographyo00ogde }}</ref>

Under Moses Annenberg, ''The Inquirer'' turned around. Annenberg added new features, increased staff and held promotions to increase circulation. By November 1938 ''Inquirer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> weekday circulation increased to 345,422 from 280,093 in 1936. During that same period the ''Record''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> circulation had dropped to 204,000 from 328,322. In 1939, Annenberg was charged with [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|income tax evasion]]. Annenberg pleaded guilty before his trial and was sent to prison where he died in 1942. Upon Moses Annenberg's death, his son, [[Walter Annenberg]], took over. Not long after, in 1947, the ''Record'' went out of business and ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' became Philadelphia's only major daily morning newspaper. While still trailing behind Philadelphia's largest newspaper, the [[Philadelphia Bulletin|''Evening Bulletin'']], ''The Inquirer'' continued to be profitable. In 1948, Walter Annenberg expanded the Inquirer Building with a new structure that housed new [[printing press]]es for ''The Inquirer'' and, during the 1950s and 1960s, Annenberg's other properties, [[Seventeen (American magazine)|''Seventeen'']]  and ''[[TV Guide]]''.<ref name="Inqhistory" /> In 1957 Annenberg bought the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' and combined the ''Daily News''<nowiki>'</nowiki> facilities with ''The Inquirer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki>.

A 38-day strike in 1958 hurt ''The Inquirer'' and, after the strike ended, so many reporters had accepted buyout offers and left that the [[newsroom]] was noticeably empty. Furthermore, many current reporters had been copyclerks just before the strike and had little experience. One of the few star reporters of the 1950s and 1960s was investigative reporter [[Harry Karafin]]. During his career Harry Karafin exposed corruption and other exclusive stories for ''The Inquirer'', but also [[Extortion|extorted]] money out of individuals and organizations. Karafin would claim he had harmful information and would demand money in exchange for the information not being made public.<ref name="Annenberg" /> This went on from the late 1950s into the early 1960s before Karafin was exposed in 1967 and convicted of extortion a year later. By the end of the 1960s, circulation and advertising revenue was in decline and the newspaper had become, according to [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], "uncreative and undistinguished."<ref name="Time" />

In 1969, Annenberg was offered US$55 million for ''The Inquirer'' by [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr.|Samuel Newhouse]], but having earlier promised [[John S. Knight]] the right of first refusal of any sale offer, Annenberg sold it to Knight instead. ''The Inquirer'', along with the ''Philadelphia Daily News'', became part of Knight Newspapers and its new subsidiary, Philadelphia Newspapers Inc. (PNI). Five years later, Knight Newspapers merged with Ridder Publications to form [[Knight Ridder]].{{cn|date=November 2020}}

When ''The Inquirer'' was bought, it was understaffed, its equipment was outdated, many of its employees were underskilled and the paper trailed its chief competitor, the ''Evening Bulletin'', in weekday circulation. However, [[Eugene L. Roberts Jr.]], who became ''The Inquirer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> executive editor in 1972, turned the newspaper around.  Between 1975 and 1990 ''The Inquirer'' won seventeen [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzers]], six consecutively between 1975 and 1980, and more journalism awards than any other newspaper in the United States. ''Time'' magazine chose ''The Inquirer'' as one of the ten best daily newspapers in the United States, calling Roberts' changes to the paper, "one of the most remarkable turnarounds, in quality and profitability, in the history of American journalism."<ref name="Time" /> By July 1980 ''The Inquirer'' had become the most circulated paper in Philadelphia, forcing the ''Evening Bulletin'' to shut down two years later. ''The Inquirer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> success was not without hardships. Between 1970 and 1985 the newspaper experienced eleven strikes, the longest lasting forty-six days in 1985. ''The Inquirer'' was also criticized for covering "[[Karachi]] better than [[Kensington, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Kensington]]".<ref name="Time" /> This did not stop the paper's growth during the 1980s, and when the ''Evening Bulletin'' shut down, ''The Inquirer'' hired seventeen ''Bulletin'' reporters and doubled its bureaus to attract former ''Bulletin'' readers.<ref name="Columbia">{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Shapiro |date=March–April 2006 |title=Looking for Light |journal=Columbia Journalism Review  }}</ref> By 1989, Philadelphia Newspapers Inc.'s editorial staff reached a peak of 721 employees.{{cn|date=November 2020}}

The 1990s saw gradually dropping circulation and advertisement revenue for ''The Inquirer''. The decline was part of a nationwide trend, but the effects were exacerbated by, according to dissatisfied ''Inquirer'' employees, the paper's resisting changes that many other daily newspapers implemented to keep readers and pressure from Knight Ridder to cut costs.<ref name="sinking" /> During most of Roberts's time as editor, Knight Ridder allowed him a great deal of freedom in running the newspaper. However, in the late 1980s, Knight Ridder had become concerned about ''The Inquirer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> profitability and took a more active role in its operations. Knight Ridder pressured ''The Inquirer'' to expand into the more profitable suburbs, while at the same time cutting staff and coverage of national and international stories.<ref name="Columbia" /> Staff cuts continued until Knight Ridder was bought in 2006, with some of ''The Inquirer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> best reporters accepting buyouts and leaving for other newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. By the late 1990s, all of the high-level editors who had worked with Eugene Roberts in the 1970s and 1980s had left, none at normal retirement age. Since the 1980s, the paper has won only three Pulitzers: a 1997 award for "Explanatory Journalism.",<ref>{{cite book |last=Merritt |first=Davis |authorlink=W.

In the years following Philadelphia Media Holdings' acquisition, ''The Inquirer'' saw larger than expected revenue losses, mostly from national advertising, and continued loss of circulation.

The papers went up for auction again in September and again Philadelphia Media Network (PMN) won the bid. After successfully negotiating a contract with all of the paper's fourteen unions, the US$139 million deal became official on October 8.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Steven |last=Church | date=September 24, 2010 | title=Philadelphia Inquirer Lenders Best Perelman in Bankruptcy Court Auction | journal=Bloomberg Businessweek |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-23/philadelphia-inquirer-lenders-outbid-raymond-perelman-for-newspaper-owner.html | accessdate=July 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | date=October 8, 2010 | title=Meet the New Boss: Philly Newspapers Sale Finally Completed | journal=Editor & Publisher |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Headlines/meet-the-new-boss-philly-newspapers-sale-finally-completed-62928-.aspx | accessdate=May 11, 2011}}</ref>

''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' continued to struggle to make a profit, due to competition from digital media sources. By May 2012 the combined journalist staff at all of Philadelphia Media Network was about 320 and some of the same stories and photographs appear both in ''The Inquirer'' and ''Daily News''. On April 2, 2012, a group of local business leaders paid $55 million for the paper, less than 15 percent of the $515 million spent to buy the papers in 2006.<ref name="2012sale">{{cite journal |date=April 2, 2012 | title=Philadelphia Inquirer sold to political figures | journal=Associated Press |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2012/04/03/reaction-to-the-latest-sale-of-daily.html?page=all | accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref>

In June 2014, PMN was sold to [[H. F. Lenfest|H.F. "Gerry" Lenfest]], who appointed C.Z.

===Move to Strawbridge's building===
Philadelphia Media Network sold the Inquirer Building in October 2011 to developer Bart Blatstein, of Tower Investments Inc., who intends to turn the complex into a [[mixed use development|mixed-use complex]] of offices retail and apartments. The next month, publisher and CEO Gregory J. Osberg announced that 600 of the 740 Philadelphia Media Network employees of ''The Inquirer'', ''Daily News'', and Philly.com would move to office space in the former [[Strawbridge's|Strawbridge & Clothier]] department store on east Market Street. The remaining employees would move to offices in the suburbs. The Philadelphia Media Network moved to the new location in July 2012, consolidating the offices entirely on the third floor. Cutbacks had left much of the {{convert|525000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} within the Inquirer Building empty, but the {{convert|125000|sqft|adj=on|m2|sigfig=2}} east Market Street location consolidated Philadelphia Media's departments, including the ''Daily News''<nowiki>'</nowiki> newsroom with ''The Inquirer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki>. The new location would include a street-level lobby and event room. Plans for the building also included electronic signage such as a [[news ticker]] on the corner of the high-rise.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Bob |last=Fernandez |date=November 14, 2011 |title=Inquirer, DN moving to 8th & Market |url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-11-14/news/30397996_1_new-location-newsroom-inquirer |journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer}}</ref><ref name="Saffron1">{{Cite journal |first=Inga |last=Saffron |date=July 14, 2012 |title=Will our move to Market Street move the street? |url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-07-14/news/32664438_1_foxwoods-circulation-managers-big-city |journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer}}</ref>

In 2019, Philadelphia Media Network was renamed from Philly.com to Inquirer.com and made the ''Daily News'' an edition of ''The Inquirer''. Philadelphia Media Network was renamed The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Why the Inquirer is replacing Philly.com| work = Billy Penn| accessdate = 2019-08-25| url = https://billypenn.com/2019/06/01/why-the-inquirer-is-replacing-philly-com/}}</ref>

===2020 "Buildings Matter, Too" article===
More than 40 ''Inquirer'' staffers called in sick to protest the newspaper's use of the headline "Buildings Matter, Too", a reference to the slogan "[[Black Lives Matter]]", in its coverage of the 2020 [[George Floyd protests]]. The editors apologized for the headline the following day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/501136-philadelphia-inquirer-reporters-skip-work-buildings-matter-too-headline|title=Philadelphia Inquirer reporters skip work after paper publishes 'Buildings Matter, Too' headline|date=June 4, 2020|accessdate=June 5, 2020|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|first=Justin|last=Wise}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/headlines-op-ed-prompt-staff-protests-ny-times-71077886|title=New York Times says senator's op-ed didn't meet standards|date=June 5, 2020|accessdate=June 5, 2020|publisher=[[ABC News]]|first=David|last=Bauder}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7qwgx/journalists-of-color-at-the-philadelphia-inquirer-stage-mass-sick-out|title=Journalists of Color at the Philadelphia Inquirer Stage Mass 'Sick out'|date=June 4, 2020|accessdate=June 5, 2020|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|first=Lauren Kaori|last=Gurley}}</ref> On June 6, the paper announced that Stan Wischnowski would resign as senior vice president and executive editor.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Stan Wischnowski resigns as The Philadelphia Inquirer's top editor|url=https://www.inquirer.com/news/stan-wischnowski-resigns-philadelphia-inquirer-20200606.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|website=The Philadelphia Inquirer}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/06/philadelphia-inquirer-editor-resigns-buildings-matter-too|title='Buildings matter': Philadelphia newspaper editor resigns after headline sparks uproar|date=June 7, 2020|accessdate=June 7, 2020|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

==Politics==
[[Image:Inquirerbldg sign.jpg|thumb|267px|The sign above the entrance to The Inquirer Building]]

John Norvell left the ''Aurora & Gazette'' and his job as editor because he disagreed with what he felt was the newspaper's editorial approval of a movement towards a European class system. When Norvell and John Walker founded ''The Inquirer'' they wanted the newspaper to represent all people and not just the higher classes. The newly launched newspaper supported [[Jeffersonian democracy]] and President Andrew Jackson, and it declared support for the right of the minority's opinion to be heard.<ref name="Inqhistory" /> A [[legend]] about the founding of ''The Inquirer'' states that Norvell  said, "There could be no better name than ''The Inquirer''. In a free state, there should always be an inquirer asking on behalf of the people: 'Why was this done? Why is that necessary work not done? Why is that man put forward? Why is that law proposed? Why? Why? Why?'"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Howie |date=May 23, 2006 |title=Asking 'Why?' since 1829 |website=The Philadelphia Inquirer}}</ref>

When Norvell and Walker sold their newspaper to Jesper Harding, Harding kept the paper close to the founder's politics and backed the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. However, disagreeing with Andrew Jackson's handling of the [[Second Bank of the United States]] he began supporting the anti-Jackson wing of the Democrats. During the [[1836 United States presidential election|1836 Presidential election]] Harding supported the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig party]] candidate over the Democratic candidate and afterwards ''The Inquirer'' became known for its support of Whig candidates.<ref name="Pressa" /> Before the American Civil War began, ''The Inquirer'' supported the preservation of the Union, and was critical of the [[Abolitionism|antislavery movement]] which many felt was responsible for the Southern succession crisis.<ref name="phillyhistory">{{Cite book|title=Philadelphia : a 300 year history|date=1982|publisher=W.W. Norton|last=Weigley |first=Russell Frank |editor-last=Wainwright |editor-first=Nicholas B. |editor-last2=Wolf |editor-first2=Edwin|isbn=0-393-01610-2|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=8532897}}</ref> Once the war began ''The Inquirer'' maintained an independent reporting of the war's events.<ref name="Inqhistory" /> However ''The Inquirer'' firmly supported the Union side. At first ''The Inquirer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> editors were against [[Emancipation Proclamation|emancipation of the slaves]], but after setbacks by the Union army ''The Inquirer'' started advocating a more pro-war and pro-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] stance. In a July 1862 article, ''The Inquirer'' wrote "in this war there can be but two parties, patriots and traitors."<ref name="phillyhistory" />

===Republican Bible===
Under James Elverson, ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' declared, "the new ''Inquirer'' shall be in all respects a complete, enterprising, progressive newspaper, moved by all the wide-awake spirit of the time and behind in nothing of interest to people who want to know what is going on every day and everywhere...steadily and vigorously Republican in its political policy, but just and fair in its treatment of all questions..."<ref name="Inqhistory" /> During the [[1900 Republican National Convention|1900 Republican convention]] in Philadelphia, Elverson set up a large electric banner over Broad Street that declared "Philadelphia Inquirer – Largest Republican Circulation in the World."<ref name="Pressa" /> At the turn of the 20th century the newspaper began editorial campaigns to improve Philadelphia, including the paving of major streets and stopping a corrupt plan to buy the polluted [[Schuylkill Canal]] for drinking water. The newspaper continued similar politics under Elverson Jr., and by the 1920s ''The Inquirer'' became known as the "Republican Bible of Pennsylvania".<ref name="Inqhistory" />

Between 1929 and 1936, while under Patenotre and Curtis-Martin, ''The Inquirer'' continued to support the Republican party and [[Herbert Hoover|President Herbert Hoover]], noticeably by not reporting on the news of the Great Depression. Statistics on unemployment or business closings were ignored, even when they came from the government. Information about Philadelphia banks closing was relegated to the back of the financial section. When Moses Annenberg took over ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', he announced that the paper would "continue to uphold the principles of the Republican Party", but in a meeting with newspaper editors shortly after, he proposed that the paper go independent and support [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the upcoming election. The editors rejected this idea and the paper remained Republican. In the late 1930s, Annenberg disagreed with Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] programs and his handling of strikes. This prompted editorials criticizing the policies of Roosevelt and his supporters. He strongly opposed Democratic Pennsylvania governor [[George Howard Earle III|George Earle]] and had ''The Inquirer'' support the Republican candidates in the 1938 Pennsylvania state elections. When Republicans swept the election there was a celebration at ''The Inquirer'' headquarters with red flares and the firing of cannons. The attacks against Democrats and the support given towards Republicans caught the attention of the Roosevelt administration. Annenberg had turned ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'' into a major challenger to its chief competitor the Democratic ''Record'', and after Annenberg began focusing on politics, Democratic politicians often attacked Annenberg and accused him of illegal business practices. In 1939, Annenberg was charged with income tax evasion, pleaded guilty before the trial, and was sent to prison for three years. Annenberg's friends and his son, Walter, claimed that the whole trial was politically motivated and his sentence was harsher than it should have been.<ref name="Annenberg" />

===Independent===
[[File:The Philadelphia Inquirer at Eagles Victory Parade (40176710721).jpg|thumb|Copies of The Inquirer being sold at the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]' [[Super Bowl LII]] victory parade in 2018]]
When the ''Record'' shut down in 1947, ''The Inquirer'' announced that it was now an independent newspaper and, frustrated with corruption in Philadelphia, supported Democratic candidates in the 1951 election.<ref name="Inqhistory" /> While Walter Annenberg had made ''The Inquirer'' independent, he did use the paper to attack people he disliked. Sometimes when a person or group angered Annenberg, that person would be [[blacklist]]ed and not mentioned anywhere within ''The Inquirer''. People on the blacklist were even [[airbrush]]ed out of images. People who were on the list at one point included [[Nicholas Katzenbach]], [[Ralph Nader]], [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], and the basketball team the [[Philadelphia Warriors]], who were not mentioned for an entire season. In 1966, Walter Annenberg used ''The Inquirer'' to attack Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate [[Milton Shapp]]. During a press conference, an ''Inquirer'' reporter asked Shapp if he had ever been a patient in a mental hospital; having never been a patient, Shapp said no. The next day's headline in ''The Inquirer'' read "Shapp Denies Ever having been in a Mental Home." Shapp attributed his loss of the election to Annenberg's attack campaign.<ref name="Annenberg" />

Annenberg was a backer and friend of [[Richard Nixon]]. In the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 presidential election]], critics later claimed Annenberg had ''The Inquirer'' look the other way when covering accusations Nixon was misappropriating funds. Later, to avoid accusations of political bias, Annenberg had ''The Inquirer'' use only [[news agency]] sources such as the [[Associated Press]] for the 1960 and 1968 presidential elections.<ref name="Annenberg" /> When Nixon was elected president in 1968, Annenberg was appointed the U.S. ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's]]. A year later when Annenberg sold the newspaper to Knight Newspapers, a part of the deal stipulated that Annenberg's name would appear as "Editor and Publisher Emeritus" in ''The Inquirer''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> [[Masthead (American publishing)|masthead]]. In 1970, Annenberg, already unhappy with changes in the newspaper, had his name removed from the paper after an editorial critical of Richard Nixon appeared.<ref name="Inqhistory" />

Under Knight Ridder, ''The Inquirer'' continued to be editorially independent. However, [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] commentators have labeled ''The Inquirer'' [[Liberalism in the United States|left leaning]],<ref>''The Radio Factor with Bill O'Reilly'', February 13, 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Smerconish |first=Michael |title=Meet the New Boss, Same as the Old Boss? |website=Philadelphia Daily News |date=July 13, 2006}}</ref> and the paper has not endorsed a Republican candidate for [[President of the United States]] since [[Gerald Ford]] in 1976.<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Troy |last=Graham |date=May 9, 2006 |title=Inquirer's pick comes with a dissent |journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer |url=http://articles.philly.com/2008-10-19/news/25264310_1_endorsement-dissenting-opinions-john-mccain}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |date=November 8, 1976 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918478,00.html |title=Who's for Whom |journal=Time }}</ref> Throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, groups supportive of [[Israel]] such as the [[Zionist Organization of America]] often accused ''The Inquirer'' of being [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Israel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zena.secureforum.com/Znet/zmag/articles/barherman.htm |title=Beyond Hypocrisy: Decoding the News |author1-last=Barsamian|author1-first=David|author2-last=Herman|author2-first=Edward S.|date=July 14, 1993 |accessdate=July 9, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060505123909/http://zena.secureforum.com/Znet/zmag/articles/barherman.htm |archivedate = May 5, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2006, ''The Inquirer'' became one of the only major United States newspapers to print one of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons]].

When Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C. (PMH) bought the paper in 2006, Brian P. Tierney and the business people behind PMH signed a pledge promising that they would not influence the content of the paper. Tierney, a Republican activist who had represented many local groups in the Philadelphia area, had criticized ''The Inquirer'' in the past on behalf of his clients. One of Tierney's clients had been the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, which he had represented during the [[Brian Tierney#Cipriano affair|Cipriano affair]]. PMH membership also included Bruce E. Toll, vice chairman of [[Toll Brothers|Toll Brothers Inc.]] Tierney said that the group was aware that the fastest way to ruin its investment in ''The Inquirer'' was to threaten the paper's [[editorial independence]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ken |last=Dilanian |date=May 24, 2006 |title=Frequent critic of media takes newspapers' helm |journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer}}</ref> The 2012 sale of Philadelphia Media Network to six local business leaders also led to concern of conflict of interest.<ref>{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Van Allen |date=April 3, 2012 |title=Reaction to the latest sale of daily newspapers |publisher=Philadelphia Business Journal | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2012/04/03/reaction-to-the-latest-sale-of-daily.html?page=all |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref> The new owners, which included New Jersey Democratic fundraiser [[George Norcross III]], media entrepreneur [[H.
