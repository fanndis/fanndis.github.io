'''Michael R. Isikoff''' (born May 12, 1952) is an American [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] who is currently the Chief Investigative Correspondent at [[Yahoo! News]].

From July 2010 to April 2014, Isikoff was the national investigative correspondent for [[NBC News]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/nbc-news-hires-newsweeks-michael-isikoff/?src=busln |work=The New York Times |title=NBC News Hires Newsweek's Michael Isikoff |date=June 7, 2010 |first=Brian |last=Stelter}}</ref> He resigned from NBC, citing the network's move in a direction that left him with "fewer opportunities" for his work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/04/michael-isikoff-leaves-nbc-news-186821.html|title=Michael Isikoff leaves NBC News}}</ref> He had previously worked for ''[[Newsweek]]'', which he joined as an investigative correspondent in June 1994, and wrote extensively on the U.S. government's [[War on Terror]], the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]], [[campaign finance]] and congressional ethics abuses, presidential politics and other national issues.

Isikoff had been prepared to break the [[Clinton–Lewinsky scandal]], but several hours before going to print, the article was killed by top ''Newsweek'' executives. As a result, the story broke first on [[Matt Drudge]]'s ''[[Drudge Report]]'' the following morning. Isikoff's book on the subject, ''Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story'', was named Best Non-Fiction Book of 1999 by the [[Book of the Month Club]].

His online column with fellow journalist [[Mark Hosenball]], "Terror Watch," won the 2005 award from the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] for best investigative reporting online. Isikoff was a part of the ''Newsweek'' team that won the [[Overseas Press Club]]'s most prestigious award, the 2001 Ed Cunningham Memorial Award for best magazine reporting from abroad for ''Newsweek''{{'}}s coverage of the War on Terror.

In the May 9, 2005, issue of ''Newsweek'', Isikoff co-wrote an article that stated that interrogators at [[Camp X-Ray (Guantanamo)|Guantanamo Bay]] "in an attempt to rattle suspects, flushed a [[Quran]] down a toilet." Detainees had earlier made similar complaints, but this was the first time a government source had appeared to confirm the story. The article caused widespread rioting and massive anti-American protests throughout some parts of the [[Islam by country|Islamic world]], resulting at least 17 deaths in [[Afghanistan]]. The magazine later retracted the story after noting that the anonymous official who was their source subsequently could not remember important details.<ref name="WaPo">{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/15/AR2005051500605.html |last=Kurtz |first=Howard|title=Newsweek Apologizes: Inaccurate Report on Koran Led to Riots |date=May 16, 2005 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> A subsequent June 4, 2005, report by the Pentagon, however, confirmed multiple instances of desecration of the Quran at Guantanamo, including one incident in which a guard's urine came through an air vent and splashed on a detainee and his Quran.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8090656/ns/us_news-security/t/pentagon-details-mishandling-quran/#.XaGRbiOZPUI/|title=Pentagon details mishandling of Quran |date=June 4, 2005}}</ref>

Isikoff once claimed that [[Linda Tripp]] offered to take the infamous blue dress (claimed to have been marked with Bill Clinton's semen as a result of a sexual encounter with Monica Lewinsky) from Lewinsky's closet and hand it over to him. Isikoff allegedly refused, saying he didn't want to take possession of stolen property and did not have access to President Bill Clinton's DNA to test the evidence on the dress anyway.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.history.com/news/lewinsky-affair-bill-clinton-impeachment-blue-dress-linda-tripp|title='Linda Tripp Offered Me the Blue Dress': Revelations from the Man Who Uncovered the Clinton-Lewinsky Scandal|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref>
