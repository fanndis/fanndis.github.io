{{short description|2011 visit by the British monarch}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}
[[Queen Elizabeth II]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] and her husband [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], made a [[state visit]] to the [[Republic of Ireland]] from 17 to 20 May 2011, at the invitation of the [[President of Ireland]], [[Mary McAleese]].

It was the first visit by a reigning [[British monarch]] to the area that is now the Republic of Ireland since the 1911 tour by Elizabeth's grandfather [[King George V]], when the entire island of [[Ireland]] was still part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].

The intervening period saw the 1916 [[proclamation of the Irish Republic]] during the [[Easter Rising]] against [[British rule in Ireland]]. A military conflict from January 1919 led ultimately to the [[partition of Ireland]] in December 1922. [[Northern Ireland]] remained part of the [[United Kingdom]], while the [[Irish Free State]] became a self-governing and then fully independent [[Dominion]] within the [[British Empire]]. In 1936 the Irish Free State removed all reference to the British monarchy from its Constitution - whilst retaining an ‘[[external association]]’ with the British crown - and the Commonwealth determined to continue to treat it as a member of the Commonwealth. In 1937 the Irish Free State adopted a republican constitution and renamed itself Ireland. In 1949 Ireland ended its practice of associating itself with the countries comprising the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth decided to regard it as no longer being a Commonwealth member.

While the visit was notable for being the first by the Queen to the Republic, she had visited the island of [[Ireland]] on many occasions during her reign; however, her visits were always confined to [[Northern Ireland]]. She had also been visited in [[London]] by President [[Mary Robinson]] in May 1993 and then several times by President McAleese since 1997.

The visit was seen as a symbolic normalisation of [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom relations]] following the signing of the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]], which settled most outstanding territorial disputes between the states, including the abandonment by the Republic of its territorial claim to Northern Ireland, thereby removing a major obstacle to a royal visit.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13410979| work=[[BBC News]]| title=The Queen in Ireland: Why royal visit had to wait| publisher=BBC.co.uk| date=16 May 2011| accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref> Arrangements for the visit included the largest security operation in the history of the Republic of Ireland.<ref name=roberts/> During the visit, the Queen visited sites of significance for [[Irish nationalism]] in Dublin, such as the [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]] and [[Croke Park]], scene of the 1920 [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] massacre.<ref>{{cite news| last=Cowell| first=Alan| title=Queen Elizabeth Visits Irish Massacre Site| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/19/world/europe/19queen.html| accessdate=24 May 2011| newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=18 May 2011}}</ref> She also delivered a widely praised speech<ref>{{cite news| title=Queen shifts gears with trip to Irish horse heartland| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/19/us-ireland-queen-idUSTRE74I3KJ20110519| date=19 May 2011| publisher=[[Reuters]]| accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref> on the history of relations between the two countries.

The visit was criticised by [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] and [[socialism|socialist]] groups. [[Sinn Féin]], the [[United Left Alliance]], some [[Independent (politician)|independent]] [[Teachta Dála|TDs]] and several smaller republican and socialist groups were opposed to the visit, with protests organised at locations on the Queen's itinerary.

In April 2014, President [[Michael D. Higgins]] [[President Michael D. Higgins' state visit to the United Kingdom|reciprocated the Queen's visit]] when he became the first Irish president to make a state visit to the United Kingdom.

==Visit announced==
The Queen's visit was formally announced by [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Áras an Uachtaráin]] simultaneously on 4 March 2011. The Queen's announcement stated:

The announcement was widely expected as both governments had anticipated the visit publicly for some time. The [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Ireland|British ambassador to Ireland]], David Reddaway, had described the visit as "imminent" in 2009.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.examiner.ie/opinion/letters/visit-of-queen-elizabeth-ii-would-be-inappropriate-and-unwelcome-99130.html| title=Visit of Queen Elizabeth II would be inappropriate and unwelcome |work=[[Irish Examiner]] |publisher=Examiner.ie |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>

Queen Elizabeth II's visit came one hundred years after the last visit by a British monarch, when her grandfather, [[King George V]], visited Kingstown (now [[Dún Laoghaire]]), Dublin, [[Leopardstown Racecourse|Leopardstown]], and [[Maynooth]] on 8–12 July 1911, as part of his accession tour.<ref name="bbc 17may">{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13420053| title=BBC News - Queen on first state visit to Republic of Ireland| date=17 May 2011| work=BBC News| publisher=BBC.co.uk| accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref><ref name=rte>{{cite news| title=The royal family leaving Kingstown (Dún Laoghaire) by carriage (1911)| url=https://stillslibrary.rte.ie/indexplus/result.html?_IXMAXHITS_=1&_IXACTION_=query&_IXFIRST_=1&_IXSR_=nlTgYJgrnhZ&_IXSS_=_IXFPFX_%3dtemplates%252ft%26_IXFIRST_%3d1%26%2524%2bwith%2brte_occupations_th_h%2bfrom%2b1%252eZZZX%25403Z%2bto%2b1%252eZZZX%25403Z%257e%3d%252e%26_IXACTION_%3dquery%26with%2bimage_sort%3d%26_IXSESSION_%3dw_gORrMhI7w%26%253cphoto_taken_date_earliest%3d&_IXSPFX_=templates%2ft&_IXFPFX_=templates%2ft| publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] Libraries and Archives| date=8 July 1911| accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://irishgenealogyqueries.yuku.com/topic/1023/The-Visit-to-Ireland-1911-2011| title=The Visit to Ireland Medal 1911 - 2011| publisher=The Royal Irish Constabulary Forum| date=10 May 2011| accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8121389/How-George-V-was-received-by-the-Irish-in-1911.html| title=How George V was received by the Irish in 1911| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| location=London| first=Gordon| last=Rayner| date=10 November 2010| accessdate=2011-05-21}}</ref>

The visit drew comparisons to the visit of [[Prince Philip]]'s uncle [[Lord Mountbatten]] in 1979, when he was killed by a [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] bombing. [[Sligo]] Mayor Matt Lyons said that the local tourist industry was still recovering from the bombing: "[[Mullaghmore, County Sligo|Mullaghmore]] attracted a lot of [[English people]] prior to Lord Mountbatten's murder.

==Initial reaction==

===Ireland===
[[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] linked the visit to the [[Good Friday Agreement]] being put into full effect.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0304/queen.html |title=Britain's Queen Elizabeth to visit Ireland |date=4 March 2011 |publisher=RTÉ.ie |work=RTÉ News and Current Affairs  |accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref> The Queen was welcomed by Irish President [[Mary McAleese]].<ref name=day1>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13424403| title=Queen's visit to Ireland: Day one as it happened| publisher=BBC.co.uk | work=BBC News |first1=Lucy| last1=Wilkins| first2=Julian |last2=Joyce| date=17 May 2011| accessdate=2011-05-18}}</ref> The [[First Minister and deputy First Minister|First Minister]] of Northern Ireland and [[Democratic Unionist Party]] leader [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]] said the visit was "a sign of the normalisation of relations between our two countries", while the leader of [[Sinn Féin]], [[Gerry Adams]], said he did not "think this is the right time for the English Queen" to visit.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12652934| title=Reaction: Queen visit to Ireland| date=4 March 2011| work=BBC News| publisher=BBC.co.uk| accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref> He further described the timing of the visit, which was to occur on the anniversary of the [[Dublin and Monaghan bombings]] as "particularly insensitive".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-13015819| work=BBC News| publisher=BBC.co.uk| title=Gerry Adams: Queen's Dublin visit timing 'insensitive'| date=8 April 2011| accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref> McAleese said it was "absolutely the right moment", and described the visit as "an extraordinary moment in Irish history".<ref name="RTÉ 16May">{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0516/queen.html| title=State visit an extraordinary moment - McAleese | date=16 May 2011| publisher=RTÉ.ie |work=RTÉ News and Current Affairs |accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref> An opinion poll conducted shortly before the visit showed that it had the support of 77% of the Irish people.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dudley |first=Ruth |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/8513971/Ireland-prepares-for-what-was-recently-unthinkable-welcoming-a-British-queen.html |title=Ireland prepares for what was recently unthinkable - welcoming a British queen |work=The Telegraph |date=15 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}</ref>{{better source|date=April 2014}}  Adams later expressed a more conciliatory tone toward the visit: "I want to see a real and meaningfully new and better relationship between the peoples of Ireland and Britain....

However, the cost of the visit was a cause for concern for some. [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]] [[Joe Higgins]] asked in [[Dáil Éireann]] if "the Queen of England {{sic}} might be politely asked to contribute to the cost of her bed & breakfast during her visit to Ireland," observing that "the Irish people needed the financial help since they could soon be – metaphorically speaking – [[Homelessness|sleeping rough]], as the country faced [[bankruptcy]] to pay off the debts of [[Germany|German]] and [[France|French]] banks which had recklessly gambled and lost in the [[Irish property bubble]]".<ref>{{cite news| authorlink=Joe Higgins| last=Higgins| first=Joe| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/05/16/ireland.uk.queen.higgins/| title=Lawmaker: Irish should not roll out 'green carpet' for Queen Elizabeth| date=17 May 2011| work=[[CNN]]| accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref> According to [[Richard Boyd Barrett]] TD, the total cost of the visit was approximately €30 million (US$42 million, GB £26 million).<ref name=day1/>

===United Kingdom===
British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] described the visit as "a huge step forward" for diplomatic relations between the two countries,<ref>{{cite news| first1=Stephen| last1=Collins| first2=Conor| last2=Lally| date=17 May 2011| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/0517/1224297121326.html| title=Queen's visit signals better future, says President| work=The Irish Times| publisher=irishtimes.com| accessdate=2011-05-21}}</ref> while former prime minister [[John Major|Sir John Major]] also rejected Gerry Adams's criticism that the visit was premature, saying that the visit put "a seal on the past and builds for the future", and that there had not been "anything of equivalent significance in the last few decades".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/major-hails-significant-visit-16000897.html| title=Major hails 'significant' visit| date=17 May 2011| work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref>

===Security===
The Queen's visit led to a number of threats of violence being issued. The [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]] borrowed two [[water cannon]] from the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] to deal with any potential instances of public disorder. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} According to [[Scotland Yard]], dissident Irish republicans issued a bomb threat regarding [[London]] on the eve of the visit.<ref name="RTÉ 16May"/> It was the first coded warning issued outside Northern Ireland in a decade, and the threat was made from an Irish telephone number. However, the threat did not change the Irish terrorism threat level in Britain, which remained at "substantial".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13412871| title=Bomb warning received in London| date=16 May 2011| work=BBC News| publisher=BBC.co.uk| accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref> There was also a terror alert in Dublin on the eve of the visit. A [[pipe bomb]] was found on a Dublin-bound bus in Maynooth, County Kildare and made safe after a warning call was made to the Gardaí. A second suspect package was found in Dublin on the first day of the visit, but was declared a hoax after being examined.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0517/device.html| title=Luas Red Line returns to normal after alert| date=17 May 2011| publisher=RTÉ.ie| work=RTÉ News and Current Affairs| accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref> On 17 May, bomb scares were reported in the Dublin suburbs of [[Inchicore]] and [[Fairview, Dublin|Fairview]].

Former Garda Commissioner [[Martin Callinan]] revealed in April 2014 that members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] had intended to kill the Queen, and arrests were made. An explosive device was found in [[Dorset Street, Dublin|Dorset Street]], close to the Garden of Remembrance. Even during the Queen's flight from London, doubts arose about whether it was safe for her to land in Ireland, and British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] held an urgent meeting in the situation room in [[Downing Street]] in response, while she was airborne.<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/arrests-made-to-protect-queen-reveals-callinan-30158974.html Arrests made to protect Queen, reveals Callinan] Sunday Independent, 2014-04-06.</ref>

===Media coverage===
The visit was covered extensively by [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] (RTÉ) and [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]]. RTÉ broadcast the events on television, radio and the [[internet]].

Around 100 people attended to protest the presence of British Crown forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0517/breaking31.html| title=Violence at Dublin protests| work=The Irish Times |date=17 May 2011| publisher=irishtimes.com| first1=Conor| last1=Lally| first2=Tim| last2=O'Brien| accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref> A protest and wreath laying ceremony by the [[socialist]] [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] party [[Éirígí]] on [[Dublin]]'s [[Moore Street]] passed off peacefully.<ref name="irishexaminer.com">{{cite web |first=Cormac| last=O'Keeffe |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/two-groups-of-protesters-with-two-different-agendas-154932.html |title=Two groups of protesters with two different agendas |publisher=Irish Examiner |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref> A protest by [[Republican Sinn Féin]] and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]] on the corner of [[Dorset Street, Dublin|Dorset Street]] and Hardwicke Street led to jostling with the Gardaí, and some balloons were released into the air.<ref name="sindo" /><ref name="irishexaminer.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/queen-elizabeth-pays-tribute-to-irish-rebels-as-god-save-the-queen-plays-in-dublin-16001163.html |title=Queen Elizabeth pays tribute to Irish rebels as God Save the Queen plays in Dublin |work=Belfast Telegraph |publisher=Belfasttelegraph.co.uk |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref>

On 18 May, a small protest organised by Republican Sinn Féin occurred peacefully near [[Croke Park]] during the Queen's visit to the stadium. During her visit to [[Dublin Castle]], protests near [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] organised by groups such as Éirígí and the 32 County Sovereignty Movement included hundreds of people, of whom eight were arrested.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thejournal.ie/eight-men-arrested-over-royal-visit-protests-139405-May2011/#slide-slideshow6| title=Eight men arrested over royal visit protests| work=The Journal |date=19 May 2011| publisher=thejournal.ie| first=Susan| last=Ryan| accessdate=2011-05-19}}</ref>

==Legacy==
It was announced in June 2012 that [[Sinn Féin]]'s [[Martin McGuinness]], the [[First Minister and deputy First Minister|deputy first minister]] of [[Northern Ireland]], would meet and shake hands with the Queen on a royal visit to the province.<ref name="meetingqueen">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18552221| title=Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness to meet Queen| work=BBC News| publisher=BBC.co.uk| date=22 June 2012| accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref> The Queen's visit to the Republic, widely seen as being successful, was mentioned by some as a factor in Sinn Féin's decision to meet the Queen. [[Lord Empey]], chairman of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], noted that Sinn Féin's refusal to meet the Queen in Dublin resulted in a negative public reaction, and said a meeting was inevitable as a result,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18557029| title=Reaction to Martin McGuinness and Queen meeting| date=22 June 2012| work=BBC News| publisher=BBC.co.uk| accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref> while Sinn Féin's Gerry Adams said the meeting would be "the right thing to do at the right time and for the right reasons."<ref name="meetingqueen"/>

The major legacy of the visit was that it set the scene for the [[State visit of the President of Ireland to the United Kingdom]] in 2014.
