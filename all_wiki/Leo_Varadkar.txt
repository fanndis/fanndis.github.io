In May 2017, Taoiseach Enda Kenny announced that he would resign as Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader.

In 2020, Varadkar called a [[2020 Irish general election|general election]] held in February. While polls in 2019 had suggested a favourable result for Fine Gael, and Varadkar focused on his handling of the [[Brexit negotiations]] with the United Kingdom, Fine Gael ultimately came third in terms of seats and votes, behind [[Fianna Fáil]] and [[Sinn Féin]], with 35 seats, a loss of 15 seats for the party from the [[2016 Irish general election|previous general election]], when it had come in first position. Varadkar resigned and was succeeded by Micheál Martin as Taoiseach. He was subsequently appointed Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment as part of a three-party coalition composed of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]].<ref name="Lehane">{{Cite journal|last=Lehane|first=Mícheál|date=2020-06-27|title=Revealed: new Cabinet and Taoiseach's Seanad nominees|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2020/0627/1150063-new-cabinet-latest/|language=en}}</ref>

Like Enda Kenny, Varadkar relied upon the support of Independents and the abstention of [[Fianna Fáil]] TDs to support his premiership.

One of Varadkar's first acts as Taoiseach was to announce a [[Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018 (Ireland)|referendum on abortion for 2018]]. He said that the government would also lay out a road map for achieving a low carbon economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/abortion-referendum-to-be-held-next-year-varadkar-says-1.3119981|title=Abortion referendum to be held next year, Varadkar says|work=The Irish Times|access-date=16 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200515042224/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/abortion-referendum-to-be-held-next-year-varadkar-says-1.3119981|archive-date=15 May 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>

His government nearly collapsed as a result of the [[Garda whistleblower scandal]] and [[Tánaiste]] (Deputy Prime Minister) [[Frances Fitzgerald (politician)|Frances Fitzgerald]]'s role in it. [[Fianna Fáil]], the main opposition party, who were in a confidence-and-supply agreement with Fine Gael, threatened a motion of no confidence in the Tánaiste. This action would have collapsed the government and caused a general election, as it would breached the confidence and supply agreement. Despite days of gridlock, the crisis was averted, after Fitzgerald resigned from the cabinet to prevent the election, which most of the country did not want due to the possibility of it jeopardising the Irish position in [[Brexit negotiations]]. Shortly after this, Varadkar appointed former leadership rival and [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade]] Simon Coveney as Tánaiste, [[Heather Humphreys]] as [[Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment|Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation]] and [[Josepha Madigan]] as [[Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht]], in a small reshuffle of the cabinet.

Shortly after the Fitzgerald crisis, an impasse was reached in the [[Brexit]] talks, as leader of the [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] [[Arlene Foster]] objected to a deal agreed to by Varadkar, [[British Prime Minister]] [[Theresa May]] and [[President of the European Commission]], [[Jean-Claude Juncker]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} This prevented an agreement from being reached as the deadline approached. Varadkar stated he was 'surprised' and 'disappointed' the UK couldn't reach a deal. However, later in the week a consensus deal was finalised. Varadkar stated he had received guarantees from the UK there would be no hard border between [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. He later said he and his cabinet had 'achieved all we set out to achieve' during the talks before quoting former British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], by saying 'This is not the end, this is the end of the beginning". An ''[[The Irish Times|Irish Times]]'' poll taken during these days showed Varadkar with a 53% approval rating, the highest for any Taoiseach since 2011, and showed Fine Gael with an eleven-point lead over Fianna Fáil. Government satisfaction was also at 41%, the highest in almost 10 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/fine-gael-support-surges-on-back-of-brexit-row-1.3318116|title=Fine Gael support surges on back of Brexit row|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=20 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208005018/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/fine-gael-support-surges-on-back-of-brexit-row-1.3318116|archive-date=8 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Irish Times'' columnist Pat Leahy claimed Varadkar had ended 2017 'on a high' and IrishCentral called it the Taoiseach's 'finest hour'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/pat-leahy-varadkar-ends-2017-on-a-high-thanks-to-brexit-talks-1.3320611?mode=sample&auth-failed=1&pw-origin=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/pat-leahy-varadkar-ends-2017-on-a-high-thanks-to-brexit-talks-1.3320611|title=Pat Leahy: Varadkar ends 2017 on a high thanks to Brexit talks|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=20 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120225934/https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/pat-leahy-varadkar-ends-2017-on-a-high-thanks-to-brexit-talks-1.3320611?mode=sample&auth-failed=1&pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fopinion%2Fpat-leahy-varadkar-ends-2017-on-a-high-thanks-to-brexit-talks-1.3320611|archive-date=20 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishcentral.com/opinion/others/british-contempt-for-ireland-shows-over-brexit-but-irish-leader-varadkar-has-his-finest-hour|title=Finest hour for Taoiseach Varadkar over Brexit border issue|date=9 December 2017|website=Irishcentral.com|accessdate=20 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402181111/https://www.irishcentral.com/opinion/others/british-contempt-for-ireland-shows-over-brexit-but-irish-leader-varadkar-has-his-finest-hour|archive-date=2 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In January 2018, he announced that the [[Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018 (Ireland)|referendum]] to repeal Ireland's [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|8th Amendment]] which prevented any liberalisation of restrictive abortion laws would take place in May. If passed, it would allow the government to introduce new legislation. It was proposed that women would be allowed unrestricted access to abortion up until 12 weeks, with exceptions if the mother's life is in danger up until six months. Varadkar said he would campaign for liberalising the laws, saying his mind was changed by difficult cases during his tenure as [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Leo Varadkar reveals abortion referendum will be held in May |last1=Murray |first1=Shona |last2=Doyle |first2=Kevin |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/leo-varadkar-reveals-abortion-referendum-will-be-held-in-may-36543756.html |work=Irish Independent |date=29 January 2018 |accessdate=30 January 2018 |quote="As minister for health I became convinced that abortion had no place in the constitution" said Mr Varadkar.

On 14 January 2020, Varadkar called for a dissolution of the [[32nd Dáil]], which was granted by President [[Michael D. Higgins]], and scheduled [[2020 Irish general election|the next election]] for 8 February.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://president.ie/en/diary/details/president-signs-warrant-for-the-dissolution-of-the-32nd-dail |title=President signs warrant for the dissolution of the 32nd Dáil |date=14 January 2020 |access-date=22 January 2020 |website=[[President of Ireland]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114232538/https://president.ie/en/diary/details/president-signs-warrant-for-the-dissolution-of-the-32nd-dail |archive-date=14 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> In that election, Fine Gael lost 12 seats in the election, falling to third place behind [[Fianna Fáil]] and [[Sinn Féin]].

During this period, the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland|COVID-19 pandemic]] arrived in Ireland. While in [[Washington, D.C.]] ahead of [[Saint Patrick's Day]], Varadkar announced measures intended to stop COVID-19 spreading, including the closure of all schools, universities and childcare facilities from the following day, as well as the closure of all cultural institutions and the cancellation of "all indoor mass gatherings of more than 100 people and outdoor mass gatherings of more than 500 people".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://merrionstreet.ie/en/News-Room/News/Statement_by_An_Taoiseach_Leo_Varadkar_On_measures_to_tackle_Covid-19_Washington_12_March_2020.html |title=Statement by An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar On measures to tackle Covid-19 Washington, 12 March 2020 |date=12 March 2020 |publisher=MerrionStreet.ie |accessdate=22 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404021202/https://merrionstreet.ie/en/News-Room/News/Statement_by_An_Taoiseach_Leo_Varadkar_On_measures_to_tackle_Covid-19_Washington_12_March_2020.html |archive-date=4 April 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> After returning home early, Varadkar addressed the nation on Saint Patrick's night during ''A Ministerial Broadcast by An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, TD'', introducing television viewers to the concept of "[[Cocooning (behaviour)|cocooning]]", i.e. "At a certain point… we will advise the elderly and people who have a long-term illness to stay at home for several weeks".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-white-house-st-patricks-day-5036232-Mar2020/ |title=Taoiseach cuts St Patrick's Day trip short to deal with evolving coronavirus situation and will not travel to New York |publisher=Thejournal.ie |date=9 March 2020 |accessdate=22 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200322012557/https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-white-house-st-patricks-day-5036232-Mar2020/ |archive-date=22 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=O'Connell |first=Hugh |url=https://www.independent.ie/world-news/coronavirus/short-us-trip-for-varadkar-as-washington-mayor-declares-state-of-emergency-over-coronavirus-spread-39038043.html |title=Short US trip for Varadkar as Washington mayor declares state of emergency over coronavirus spread |work=Irish Independent |date=11 March 2020 |accessdate=22 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200322012553/https://www.independent.ie/world-news/coronavirus/short-us-trip-for-varadkar-as-washington-mayor-declares-state-of-emergency-over-coronavirus-spread-39038043.html |archive-date=22 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://merrionstreet.ie/en/News-Room/Speeches/Address_by_An_Taoiseach_Leo_Varadkar_17th_March.html |title=Address by An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar 17th March |date=17 March 2020 |publisher=MerrionStreet.ie |accessdate=22 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404014811/https://merrionstreet.ie/en/News-Room/Speeches/Address_by_An_Taoiseach_Leo_Varadkar_17th_March.html |archive-date=4 April 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The speech was the most watched television event in Irish history, surpassing the previous record held by ''[[The Late Late Toy Show]]'' by an additional total of about 25% and was widely distributed globally.<ref>{{cite news |last=Finn |first=Melanie |url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/television/tv-news/leos-speech-sets-new-tv-record-as-16-million-tune-in-39057364.html |title=Leo's speech sets new TV record as 1.6 million tune in |work=Irish Independent |date=19 March 2020 |accessdate=22 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200322012552/https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/television/tv-news/leos-speech-sets-new-tv-record-as-16-million-tune-in-39057364.html |archive-date=22 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=O'Connell |first=Hugh |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/behind-the-lines-the-who-how-and-why-that-created-leo-varadkars-historic-speech-39057126.html |title=Behind the lines: The who, how and why that created Leo Varadkar's historic speech |work=Irish Independent |date=19 March 2020 |accessdate=22 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404061206/https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/behind-the-lines-the-who-how-and-why-that-created-leo-varadkars-historic-speech-39057126.html |archive-date=4 April 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was also plagiarised by [[Peter Bellew]], the chief operating officer at British low-cost airline group [[EasyJet]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Rob |last=Davies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/21/easyjet-sorry-as-staff-motivation-video-copies-leo-varadkar |title=EasyJet sorry as staff motivation video copies Leo Varadkar |work=The Guardian |date=21 March 2020 |accessdate=22 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200428155842/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/21/easyjet-sorry-as-staff-motivation-video-copies-leo-varadkar |archive-date=28 April 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Three-party coalition ==
===Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (2020–present)===
On 26 June 2020, it was announced that [[Fine Gael]], [[Fianna Fáil]], and the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] had agreed to form a coalition government, marking the first time the two main Irish parties had formed a government together. As part of the agreement, Fianna Fáil leader [[Micheál Martin]] will hold the office of Taoiseach until December 2022, while Varadkar will take the position of [[Tánaiste]]. The pair will then swap roles after roughly 2½ years into the term, with Varadkar retaking the position of Taoiseach for the remainder of the coalition's term. Martin was elected Taoiseach by the Dáil on 27 June, with Varadkar appointed Tánaiste and [[Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment]].<ref name="Lehane"/>

On 31 October 2020, ''[[Village (magazine)|Village magazine]]'' published an article alleging that Varadkar had leaked confidential documents, including a draft contract between the [[Health Service Executive]] and [[general practitioner]]s that was agreed but still subject to acceptance by GPs at the time, and unavailable to members of the Oireachtas. The article included screenshots of [[WhatsApp]] messages, including one with a photo of the cover of the leaked document, and alleged the handwriting visible was Varadkar's.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://villagemagazineireland2020.medium.com/leo-varadkar-lawbreaker-t%C3%A1naiste-leaked-confidential-document-to-friend-efdd1f14cfcb|title=Leo Varadkar, lawbreaker: Tánaiste leaked confidential document to friend|work=Village|date=31 October 2020|access-date=31 October 2020}}</ref> While ''Village'' claimed the leaks might be unlawful, Varadkar denied this was the case and described the article as "inaccurate and grossly defamatory".

In response to the claims by ''Village'', the Green Party called for Varadkar to give a detailed account to the Dáil in response to the accusations. The request for a Dáil investigation was seconded by Sinn Féin's health spokesperson, stating "The facts for me here are clear - Leo, as the leader of Fine Gael and Taoiseach at the time, passed on a document to a friend about sensitive negotiations involving hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money",<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rte.ie/news/2020/1101/1175252-leo-varadkar/ |title= Tánaiste accused of 'hiding behind lame excuses' by Sinn Féin |website= www.rte.ie| publisher= RTE |date= 1 November 2020}}</ref> while Varadkar's Fine Gael colleague [[Paschal Donohoe]] also expressed a desire for an investigation to be held.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-40074140.html |title= Varadkar controversy: Donohoe says not 'common practice' to share confidential documents |website= www.irishexaminer.com| publisher= Irish Examiner |date= 1 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.thejournal.ie/fianna-fail-fine-gael-leo-varadkar-norma-foley-imo-5251560-Nov2020/|title= Fianna Fáil minister says Varadkar's actions not 'appropriate' and calls for 'very frank' Dáil statement |website= www.thejournal.ie| publisher= The Journal |date= 1 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.thejournal.ie/leo-varadkar-green-party-gp-contract-dail-5251060-Oct2020/|title= Varadkar under pressure to take questions in Dáil about sharing of draft GP contract |website= www.thejournal.ie| publisher= The Journal |date= 31 October 2020}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Varadkar is the first Irish government leader of Indian origin and has visited [[India]] on a number of occasions. He completed his medical internship at [[King Edward Memorial Hospital and Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College|KEM Hospital]] in his father's childhood city of [[Mumbai]].

During an interview on [[RTÉ Radio]] on 18 January 2015 (his 36th birthday), Varadkar spoke publicly for the first time about being gay: "it's not something that defines me. I'm not a half-Indian politician, or a doctor politician or a gay politician for that matter. It's just part of who I am, it doesn't define me, it is part of my character I suppose".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/leo-varadkar-i-am-a-gay-man-minister-says-1.2070189|title=Leo Varadkar: 'I am a gay man', Minister says|work=The Irish Times|date=18 January 2015|accessdate=18 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118172918/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/leo-varadkar-i-am-a-gay-man-minister-says-1.2070189|archive-date=18 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Varadkar was a prominent advocate of the [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|same-sex marriage referendum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/leo-varadkar-i-wanted-to-be-an-equal-citizen-and-today-i-am-1.2223688|title=Leo Varadkar: 'I wanted to be an equal citizen . . . and today I am'|work=The Irish Times|access-date=16 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925113608/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/leo-varadkar-i-wanted-to-be-an-equal-citizen-and-today-i-am-1.2223688|archive-date=25 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/referendum/10-factors-behind-the-yes-sides-victory-31247192.html|title=10 factors behind the 'Yes' side's victory|first=Nial|last=O'Connor|work=Irish Independent|date=23 May 2015|access-date=23 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621144846/https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/referendum/10-factors-behind-the-yes-sides-victory-31247192.html|archive-date=21 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> His partner, Matthew Barrett, is a doctor at [[Mater Misericordiae University Hospital]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/meet-the-dashing-doctor-boyfriend-supporting-leo-varadkar-in-his-fine-gael-leadership-bid-35469585.html | accessdate = 29 May 2017 | date = 21 February 2017 | work = The Independent | title = Meet the dashing doctor boyfriend supporting Leo Varadkar in his Fine Gael leadership bid | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190331010435/https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/meet-the-dashing-doctor-boyfriend-supporting-leo-varadkar-in-his-fine-gael-leadership-bid-35469585.html | archive-date = 31 March 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | work = The Irish Times | url = https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/fine-gael-leadership-race-leo-varadkar-1.3086625 | accessdate = 29 May 2017 | title = Fine Gael leadership race: Leo Varadkar | date = 17 May 2017 | first = Sarah | last = Barton | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171108010252/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/fine-gael-leadership-race-leo-varadkar-1.3086625 | archive-date = 8 November 2017 | url-status = live }}</ref>
