The '''University of Virginia School of Law''' ('''Virginia Law''' or '''UVA Law''') was founded in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] in 1819 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] as part of his "academical village," the [[University of Virginia]], where law was one of the original disciplines taught. UVA Law is the [[Law school in the United States#Oldest active law schools|fourth-oldest active law school]] in the United States and the second-oldest continuously operating law school. The law school offers the [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]], [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]], and [[Doctor of Juridical Science|S.J.D.]] degrees in law and hosts visiting scholars, visiting researchers and a number of legal research centers.

Virginia Law is considered one of the top ten ranked law schools in the United States. Notable alumni include [[U.S. Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court Justices]] [[James Clark McReynolds]] and [[Stanley Forman Reed]], as well as numerous members of [[U.S. Congress]] and judges on federal courts throughout the United States. UVA Law has 19,984 alumni in all 50 states, more than 60 foreign countries and several U.S. protectorates.<ref name="law.virginia.edu">{{cite web|url=https://content.law.virginia.edu/news/201607/majority-alumni-give-uva-law-11th-consecutive-year|title=Majority of Alumni Give to UVA Law for 11th Consecutive Year|date=19 October 2016|website=virginia.edu|accessdate=1 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130044011/https://content.law.virginia.edu/news/201607/majority-alumni-give-uva-law-11th-consecutive-year|archivedate=30 November 2016}}</ref>

==Campus==
[[File:University of Virginia School of Law, Spies Garden.jpg|thumb|alt=Spies Garden|Spies Garden]]UVA Law receives no funding from the state; instead, the school depends upon the generosity of private donors (bolstered by its over 50% alumni giving rate), its substantial endowment ([[United States dollar|US $]] 555 [[1000000 (number)|million]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/about/factsstats.htm |title=Facts & Statistics |accessdate=2016-11-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130090946/http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/about/factsstats.htm |archivedate=2016-11-30 }}</ref>), the 5th largest among all law schools, and student tuition payments. In 1995–1997, UVA Law used entirely donated funds to renovate and expand its buildings on the University's North Grounds to include the former facilities of the [[Darden Graduate School of Business Administration]], which built a new campus several hundred yards away.

The Arthur J. Morris Law Library holds more than 820,000 volumes, including substantial collections of federal, state, and international documents, manuscripts, archives, and online research databases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/about/factsstats.htm|title=Overview|date=19 April 2017|website=virginia.edu|accessdate=1 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602093137/http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/about/factsstats.htm|archivedate=2 June 2017}}</ref>

The ''[[Virginia Law Weekly]]'', UVA Law's student-run weekly newspaper, has been published since 1948. The paper has been cited in several court cases, including in the dissenting opinion of [[Justice Powell]] in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''Patterson v. New York''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=432&invol=197 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010725050815/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=432&invol=197 |archivedate=2001-07-25 }}</ref> In addition to its news content, the VLW also contains student-submitted content, which often includes humorous and creative pieces.

Each spring, over one hundred students write, direct and perform in ''The Libel Show,'' a comedy and musical theater production that was first organized in 1904.  Its performers roast Law School professors, student stereotypes and life in Charlottesville throughout each of its three nightly showings.  Professors write and sing their response to the students' jokes at the penultimate performance.

The school hosts an annual softball tournament to raise money for ReadyKids, an organization that provides care and counseling for at-risk families in Central Virginia, and the Public Interest Law Association, which provides public service internships for law students.  51 different law schools send teams to compete in men's and co-rec brackets.  In 2017, $25,000 was raised.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/uva/uva-law-softball-tournament-raises-k-for-charity/article_d16afb9e-1f03-11e7-93e7-bf2c954a567c.html|title=UVa Law softball tournament raises $25K for charity|last=reports|first=The Daily Progress staff|work=The Daily Progress|access-date=2017-04-28|language=en}}</ref>
