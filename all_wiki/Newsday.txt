==History==
Founded by [[Alicia Patterson]] and her husband, [[Harry Guggenheim]], the publication was first produced on September 3, 1940 from [[Hempstead, NY|Hempstead]].<ref>Arlen, A., Arlen, M.J. ''The Huntress: The Adventures, Escapades, and Triumphs of Alicia Patterson: Aviatrix, Sportswoman, Journalist, Publisher'' (Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2016) {{ISBN|9781101871133}}</ref> For many years until a major redesign in the 1970s, ''Newsday'' copied the ''Daily News'' format of short stories and numerous pictures. (Ironically, Patterson was fired as a writer at her father's ''Daily News'' in her early 20s, after getting the basic facts of a divorce wrong in a published report.) After Patterson's death in 1963, Guggenheim became publisher and editor.

In 1967, Guggenheim turned over the publisher position to [[Bill Moyers]] and continued as president and editor-in-chief. But Guggenheim was disappointed by the liberal drift of the newspaper under Moyers, criticizing what he called the "left-wing" coverage of Vietnam War protests.<ref name="time42770">{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909136,00.html|title=The Press: How Much Independence?

After the competing ''[[Long Island Press]]'' (not to be confused with the alternative weekly of the same name) ceased publication in 1977, ''Newsday'' launched a separate [[Queens, New York City|Queens]] edition, followed by a New York City edition dubbed ''New York Newsday''. In June 2000, Times Mirror merged with the [[Tribune Company]], partnering ''Newsday'' with the New York City television station [[WPIX]] (Channel 11), also owned by Tribune.

With the Times Mirror-Tribune merger, the newspaper founded by [[Alicia Patterson]] was now owned by the company that was founded by her great-grandfather, [[Joseph Medill]] — which owns the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and, until 1991, also owned her father's ''Daily News''. (Tribune sold the ''Daily News'' to British newspaper magnate [[Robert Maxwell]]. After Maxwell's death in 1992, his publishing empire collapsed and [[Mortimer Zuckerman]] purchased the ''Daily News''.) [[Chicago, Illinois]], real estate magnate [[Samuel Zell]] purchased Tribune in 2007.<ref name=nyt />

==Editorial style==
Despite having a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format, ''Newsday'' is not known for being sensationalistic, as are other local daily tabloids, such as the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' and the ''[[New York Post]]''.<ref>Stevens, John D., ''Sensationalism and the New York Press'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1991) {{ISBN|0-231-07396-8}}</ref><ref>Hamill, Pete, ''News Is a Verb: Journalism at the End of the Twentieth Century'' (New York: Ballantine Books, 1998) {{ISBN|0-345-42528-6}}</ref>  This causes Newsday to sometimes be referred to as "the respectable tabloid".<ref>Keeler, Robert F. (1990). Newsday: a candid history of the respectable tabloid. Morrow. pp. 460–61. {{ISBN|1-55710-053-5}}.</ref>

In 2004, the alternative weekly newspaper ''[[Long Island Press]]'' (which is not related to the defunct daily of the same name) wrote that ''Newsday'' has used its clout to influence local politics in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] Counties.<ref>''[[Long Island Press]]'', "Game Over: How the Paper's Monopoly Control Has Warped its Coverage and Hurt Long Island", by Christopher Twarowski, December 30, 2004: "Numerous politicians in both counties, county workers, directors of community groups and other sources claim that 'Newsday' uses its position as Long Island's only daily paper to strong-arm county officials, nonprofit directors, local leaders and rival publications and even to influence pieces of legislation — often through fear, intimidation and other anti-competitive practices — to further its political or commercial agenda".</ref>

[[Bill Moyers]] briefly served as publisher.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/M/htmlM/moyesrbill/moyersbill.htm|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications: Moyer biography}}</ref> During the tenure of publisher [[Robert M. Johnson]] in the 1980s, Newsday made a major push into New York City. The paper's roster of columnists and critics has included [[Cathy Young]], [[Jimmy Breslin]], [[Barbara Garson]], [[Normand Poirier]], [[Murray Kempton]], [[Gail Collins (journalist)|Gail Collins]], [[Pete Hamill]], [[Sydney Schanberg]], [[Robert Reno]] (died 2012), [[Jim Dwyer (journalist)|Jim Dwyer]], sportswriter [[Mike Lupica]], music critic [[Tim Page (music critic)|Tim Page]], and television critic [[Marvin Kitman]]. The paper featured both [[advice column]]ists [[Ann Landers]] and [[Dear Abby]] for several years.  From 1985 to 2005, Michael Mandelbaum wrote a regular foreign affairs analysis column for ''Newsday''. Noted writer and biographer [[Robert Caro]] was an investigative reporter. Its features section has included, among others, television [[reporter]]s [[Verne Gay]] and [[Diane Werts]], TV/film feature writer [[Frank Lovece]], and film critic [[Rafer Guzman]]. Newsday carries the syndicated columnist [[Froma Harrop]]. [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Walt Handelsman]]'s editorial political cartoons animation are a nationally syndicated feature of Newsday. In the 1980s, a new design director, Robert Eisner, guided the transition into digital design and color printing. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

''Newsday'' created and sponsored a "Long Island at the Crossroads" advisory board in 1978, to recommend regional goals, supervise local government, and liaison with state and Federal officials.<ref>

It lasted approximately a decade.

On March 21, 2011, ''Newsday'' redesigned its front page, scrapping the [[nameplate (publishing)|nameplate]] and font used since the 1960s in favor of a sans-serif wordmark.<ref>[http://www.newsday.com/long-island/meet-the-new-newsday-1.2773390 "Meet the new Newsday"] ''Newsday'' (March 21, 2011)</ref>

==Circulation==
In 2008, ''Newsday'' was ranked 10th in terms of newspaper circulation in the United States.<ref name=nyt />

A circulation scandal in 2004 revealed that the paper's daily and Sunday circulation had been inflated by 16.9% and 14.5%, respectively, in the auditing period September 30, 2002 to September 30, 2003.<ref name=abc2>{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessabc.com/press/press111604.htm|title=Audit Bureau of Circulation, "ABC Releases ''Newsday'' Audit", November 16, 2004}}</ref> The Audit Bureau of Circulation adjusted average weekday circulation to 481,816 from 579,599; average Saturday circulation to 392,649 from 416,830; and average Sunday circulation to 574,081 from 671,820, and instituted twice-yearly audits.<ref name=abc2 />
 
On October 28, 2009, ''Newsday'' changed its web site to a [[Pay wall|paid-subscriber only model]]. Newsday.com would open its front page, classified ads, movie listings, and school closings to all site visitors, but access beyond this content would require a weekly fee – US$5 as of 2010. This fee would be waived for subscribers of the print edition of the paper, as well as for subscribers to parent-company Cablevision's Internet service.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20091022/FREE/910229988|title=Newsday to begin charging for online articles |last=Flamm|first=Matthew|date=October 22, 2009|publisher=Crain's New York|accessdate=2009-10-31}}</ref> Through its first three months only 35 non-Optimum, non-''Newsday'' subscribers signed up for the paid web site.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.observer.com/2010/01/after-three-months-only-35-subscriptions-for-inewsdayis-web-site|title=After Three Months, Only 35 Subscriptions for Newsday's Web Site|last=Koblin|first=John|date=January 26, 2010|publisher=The New York Observer|accessdate=2012-04-26}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
* In the 1985 comedy/thriller ''[[Compromising Positions]]'', the lead character, played by [[Susan Sarandon]], is a former ''Newsday'' journalist who is trying reestablish her career by selling a freelance story to the publication.
* On the 1996–2005 [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'', the fictional character [[Ray Barone]] (played by [[Ray Romano]]) is employed by ''Newsday'' as a sportswriter.
* The lead female character in the ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' films works at ''Newsday''.
* The episode "[[The Homer They Fall]]" in season eight of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' quotes ''Newsday'' calling [[boxing]] "the cruelest sport".
* ''[[Naked Came the Stranger]]'' is a 1969 novel written as a literary hoax poking fun at contemporary American culture. Although credited to "Penelope Ashe", it was in fact written by a group of twenty-four journalists led by ''Newsday'' columnist Mike McGrady. McGrady's intention was to write a deliberately terrible book with a lot of sex, to illustrate the point that popular American literary culture had become mindlessly vulgar. The book fulfilled the authors' expectations and became a bestseller in 1969; they revealed the hoax later that year, further spurring the book's popularity.
*Former editor Howard Schneider appears in the documentary ''[[Three Identical Strangers]]'' to discuss ''Newsday''<nowiki/>'s coverage of three young men who discovered they were separated as infants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/three-identical-strangers-movie-1.19306038|title=Film chronicles LI triplets separated at birth|website=Newsday|language=en|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref>
