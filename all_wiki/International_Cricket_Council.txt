The '''International Cricket Council''' ('''ICC''') is the world [[Sports governing body|governing body]] of [[cricket]]. It was founded as the ''Imperial Cricket Conference'' in 1909 by representatives from Australia, England and South Africa. It was renamed as the ''International Cricket Conference'' in 1965, and took up its current name in 1989. It organises world championship events such as [[Cricket World Cup]], [[Women's Cricket World Cup]], [[ICC T20 World Cup]], [[ICC Women's T20 World Cup]], [[ICC Champions Trophy]] and [[Under-19 Cricket World Cup]].

The ICC has 104 member nations currently: 12 [[List of International Cricket Council members#Full Members|Full Members]] that play [[Test cricket|Test matches]], and 92 [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate Members|Associate Members]].<ref name="members">{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/members|title=ICC Members|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ICC|accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref> The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, most notably the [[Cricket World Cup]] and [[ICC T20 World Cup]]. It also appoints the [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]] and [[referee]]s that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, [[One Day International]] and [[Twenty20 International]]s. It promulgates the [[ICC Code of Conduct]], which sets professional standards of discipline for international cricket,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/rules/code-of-conduct-for-players-and-officials.pdf |title=International Cricket Council – ICC Events, ICC Cricket Rankings, Live Cricket Scores |publisher=Icc-cricket.com |accessdate=8 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712131901/http://www.icc-cricket.com/icc/rules/code-of-conduct-for-players-and-officials.pdf |archivedate=12 July 2007  }}</ref> and also co-ordinates action against corruption and [[match-fixing]] through its [[ICC Anti Corruption and Security Unit|Anti-Corruption and Security Unit]] (ACSU).

The ICC does not control bilateral fixtures between member countries (which include all [[Test cricket|Test matches]]), and neither does it govern domestic cricket within member countries. It does not make or alter the [[Laws of cricket|laws of the game]], which have remained under the governance of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] since 1788.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/laws/|title=Laws|website=www.lords.org|language=en|access-date=12 July 2018}}</ref>

The [[Chairman of the International Cricket Council|Chairman]] heads the board of directors and on 26 June 2014, [[Narayanaswami Srinivasan]], the former president of [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI]], was announced as the first chairman of the council.<ref>{{cite web|title=Srinivasan elected as the new Chairman of ICC from July 2014 onwards|url=http://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/srinivasan-elected-as-the-new-chairman-of-icc-from-july-2014-onwards-1392007635-1|website=Jagran Prakashan| date= 10 February 2014|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>  The role of ICC president has become a largely honorary position since the establishment of the chairman role and other changes were made to the ICC constitution in 2014.

==History==

=== 1909–1963 – Imperial Cricket Conference ===

On 30 November 1907, [[Abe Bailey]], the President of South African Cricket Association, wrote a letter to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]]'s (MCC, England) secretary, F.E. Lacey. Bailey suggested the formation of an 'Imperial Cricket Board'. In the letter, he suggested that the board would be responsible for formulation of rules and regulations which will govern the international matches between the three members: Australia, England and South Africa. Bailey, wanted to host a Triangular Test series between the participant countries in South Africa. Australia rejected the offer. However, Bailey did not lose hope. He saw an opportunity of getting the three members together during the Australia's tour of England in 1909. After continued lobbying and efforts, Bailey was successful.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/the-icc/history-of-icc/1909-1963|title=International Cricket Council|website=www.icc-cricket.com|language=en|access-date=10 July 2018}}</ref>

On 15 June 1909, representatives from [[English cricket team|England]], [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] and [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] met at [[Lord's]] and founded the ''Imperial Cricket Conference''. A month later, a second meeting between the three members was held. The rules were agreed amongst the nations, and the first ever Tri-Test series was decided to be held in England in 1912.<ref name=":0"/>

In 1926, [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies]], [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] and [[Indian cricket team|India]] were elected as Full Members, doubling the number of Test-playing nations to six. After the formation of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, it was given [[Test status]] in 1952, becoming the seventh Test-playing nation. In May 1961 South Africa left the Commonwealth and therefore lost membership.<ref name=":0" />

=== 1964–1988 – International Cricket Conference ===

In 1964, the ICC agreed upon including the non-Test playing countries. The following year, the ICC changed its name to the International Cricket Conference. Under the new type of membership, the Associate. [[US]], [[Ceylon]] and [[Fiji]] were admitted.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/the-icc/history-of-icc/1964-1988|title=International Cricket Council|website=www.icc-cricket.com|language=en|access-date=12 July 2018}}</ref>

In 1968, [[Denmark]], [[Bermuda]], [[Netherlands]], and [[East Africa]] were admitted as Associate. South Africa had still not applied to rejoin the ICC.

In 1969, the basic rules of ICC were amended.

In 1971 meeting, the idea of organizing a World Cup was introduced. In 1973 meeting, it was decided that a World Cup will be played in 1975 in England. The six Test playing nations and [[East Africa]] and [[Sri Lanka]] were invited to take part.<ref name=":1" />

New members were added regularly during this period:

In 1974,  [[Israel]] and [[Singapore]] were admitted as Associate.

In 1976, [[West Africa]] was admitted as Associate.

In 1977, [[Bangladesh]] was admitted as Associate.

In 1978, [[Papua-New Guinea]] was admitted as Associate. [[South Africa]] applied to rejoin, however their application was rejected.

In 1981, [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] was promoted to being a Full Member. They played their first Test in 1982.

In 1984, the third type of membership; Affiliate category of membership was added to the ICC. [[Italy]] was the first member, followed by [[Switzerland]] in 1985. In 1987, [[Bahamas]] and [[France]] were admitted, followed by [[Nepal]] in 1988.

=== 1989–present – International Cricket Council ===
In the July meeting of 1989, the ICC renamed itself to the International Cricket Council and the trend of the MCC President automatically becoming the Chairman of ICC was terminated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/the-icc/history-of-icc/1989-present|title=International Cricket Council|website=www.icc-cricket.com|language=en|access-date=23 July 2018}}</ref>

In 1990, [[UAE]] joined as an associate.

In 1991, for the first time in ICC history the meeting was held away from [[England]] – in [[Melbourne]]. [[South Africa]] was re-elected as a Full Member of the ICC in July, after the end of [[apartheid]].

In 1992, [[Zimbabwe Cricket|Zimbabwe]] was admitted as the ninth Full Member of the International Cricket Council (Full Member). [[Namibia]] joined as Associate member. [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Brunei]] and [[Spain]] joined as Affiliates.

In 1993, the ''Chief Executive of ICC'' was created with [[David Richards (cricket administrator)|David Richards]] of the Australian Cricket Board the first person appointed to the position. In July, [[Sir Clyde Walcott]], from Barbados, was elected as the first non-British Chairman. The emergence of new technology saw the introduction of a [[third umpire]] who was equipped with video playback facilities.

By 1995, TV replays were made available for run outs and stumpings in Test matches with the third umpire required to signal out or not out with red and green lights respectively. The following year, the cameras were used to determine if the ball had crossed the boundary, and in 1997 decisions on the cleanness of catches could be referred to the third umpire. This year also saw the introduction of the [[Duckworth-Lewis method]] of adjusting targets in rain-affected ODI matches.

In 2000, [[Bangladesh Cricket Board|Bangladesh]] were admitted as the tenth Full Member of the International Cricket Council.

In 2005, ICC moved its new headquarters in [[Dubai]].

In 2017, [[Afghanistan Cricket Board|Afghanistan]] and [[Cricket Ireland|Ireland]] were admitted as the eleventh and twelfth Full Members of the International Cricket Council after a unanimous vote at the ICC Full Council meeting at [[The Oval]].

In 2018, All Women's T20 matches were elevated as to [[Women's Twenty20 International]] status.

'''Associate Members''' – The 92 governing bodies in countries where cricket is firmly established and organised, but have not been granted Full Membership yet.

==Location==
[[Image:ICC Dubai 1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The ICC's offices in [[Dubai]]]]
From its formation, the ICC had [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] as its home, and from 1993 had its offices in the "Clock Tower" building at the nursery end of the ground. The independent ICC was funded initially by commercial exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One Day International cricket. As not all Member countries had [[Double taxation|double-tax agreements]] with the United Kingdom, it was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC Development (International) Pvt. Ltd – known as IDI, outside the UK. This was established in January 1994 and was based in Monaco.

For the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest affair. But with the negotiation of a bundle of rights to all ICC events from 2001–2008, revenues available to International cricket and the ICC member countries rose substantially. This led to a growth in the number of commercial staff employed by IDI in Monaco. It also had the disadvantage that the council's cricket administrators, who remained at Lord's, were separated from their commercial colleagues in Monaco. The Council decided to seek ways of bringing all of their staff together in one office while protecting their commercial income from tax.

The option of staying at Lord's was investigated and a request was made, through [[Sport England]], to the British Government to allow the ICC to have all its personnel (including those working on commercial matters) in London – but be given special exemption from paying UK [[corporation tax]] on its commercial income. The British Government was unwilling to create a precedent and would not agree to this request. As a consequence, the ICC examined other locations and eventually settled on the emirate of [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. ICC is registered in [[British Virgin Islands]]. In August 2005, the ICC moved its offices to [[Dubai]], and subsequently closed its offices at Lord's and Monaco. The move to Dubai was made after an 11–1 vote by the ICC's Executive Board in favour.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/4326601.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cricket chiefs move base to Dubai | date=7 March 2005}}</ref>

While the principal driver of the ICC's move to [[Dubai]] was the wish to bring its main employees together in one tax efficient location, a secondary reason was the wish to move offices closer to the increasingly important new centres of cricketing power in South Asia. Lord's had been a logical venue when the ICC had been administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) (a situation that lasted until 1993). But the growing power of India and Pakistan in world cricket had made the continued control of international cricket by a British private members club (the MCC) anachronistic and unsustainable. A direct consequence of the changes and reforms instituted in 1993 was eventually to be the move away from Lord's to a more neutral venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GD23Df05.html|title= Cricket's home moves closer to the money|work=[[Asia Times Online]]| date=23 April 2005|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>

==Income generation==
[[File:ICC logo 2010.jpg|thumb|Variant ICC Logo with old motto]]
The ICC generates income from the tournaments it organises, primarily the [[Cricket World Cup]], and it distributes the majority of that income to its members. Sponsorship and television rights of the World Cup brought in over US$1.6&nbsp;billion between 2007 and 2015, by far the ICC's main source of income.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/current/story/271994.html |title=ICC rights go to ESPN-Star|publisher=[[ESPN]] | work=[[Cricinfo]]|date= 9 December 2006|accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/276853.html |title=ICC set to cash in on sponsorship rights |publisher=[[ESPN]] | work=[[Cricinfo]] |date= 18 January 2007|accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref> In the nine-month accounting period to 31 December 2007 the ICC had operating income of $12.66&nbsp;million, mainly from member subscriptions and sponsorship. In contrast, event income was [[US$]]285.87&nbsp;million, including $239&nbsp;million from the 2007 World Cup. There was also investment income of $6.695&nbsp;million in the period.{{Update inline|reason=There have been 3 World Cups since this date|date=July 2019}}

The ICC has no income streams from the bilateral international cricket matches ([[Test cricket|Test matches]], [[One Day International]] and [[Twenty20|Twenty20 Internationals]]), that account for the great majority of the international playing schedule, as they are owned and run by its members. It has sought to create other new events to augment its World Cup revenues. These include the [[ICC Champions Trophy]] and the [[ICC Super Series]] played in Australia in 2005. However these events have not been as successful as the ICC hoped. The Super Series was widely seen as a failure and is not expected to be repeated, and India called for the Champions Trophy to be scrapped in 2006.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/biggest-player-in-the-game-flexes-muscle/2006/01/06/1136387626870.html | location=Melbourne | work=[[The Age]] | title=Biggest player in the game flexes muscle | date=7 January 2006}}</ref> The [[2004 ICC Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy 2004]] event was referred to in ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden 2005]]'' by the editor as a "turkey of a tournament" and a "fiasco"; although the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy|2006 edition]] was seen as a greater success due to a new format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html |title=ICC President thanks India for "outstanding" ICC Champions Trophy | author=Murgatroyd, Brian / ICC|publisher=ESPN | work=Cricinfo |date= 6 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html |title=When the cricket did all the talking |publisher=ESPN | work=Cricinfo |date= 7 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>

The [[ICC World Twenty20]], first played [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|in 2007]], was a success. The ICC's current plan is to have an international tournament every year, with a Twenty20 World Cup played in even number years, the World Cup continuing to be held the year before the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], and the ICC Champions Trophy in the remaining year of the cycle. This cycle will begin [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|in 2010]], one year after the [[2009 ICC World Twenty20|2009 edition]].

== Rules and regulation ==
The International Cricket Council oversees playing conditions, bowling reviews, and other ICC regulations. The ICC does not have copyright to the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'': only the MCC may change the Laws, though this is usually done in consultation with the game's global governing body. The ICC maintains a set of playing conditions for international cricket which make slight amendments to the Laws. They also have a "[[ICC Code of Conduct|Code of Conduct]]" to which teams and players in international matches are required to adhere. Where breaches of this code occur the ICC can apply sanctions, usually fines. In 2008, the ICC imposed 19 penalties on players.

==Umpires and referees==
The ICC appoints international [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]] and [[Match referee]]s who officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. The ICC operates 3 panels of umpires: namely the [[Elite Panel of ICC Umpires|Elite Panel]], the [[International Panel of Umpires and Referees|International Panel]], and the [[ICC Associates and Affiliates umpire panel|Associates and Affiliates Panel]].

As of April 2012, the Elite Panel includes twelve umpires. In theory, two umpires from the Elite Panel officiate at every Test match, while one Elite Panel umpire stands in ODI matches together with an umpire from the International Panel. In practice, members of the International Panel stand in occasional Test matches, as this is viewed as a good opportunity to see whether they can cope at the Test level, and whether they should be elevated to the Elite Panel. The Elite Panel are full-time employees of the ICC, although do still, very occasionally umpire [[first-class cricket]] in their country of residence. The average, annual, officiating schedule for Elite Umpires is 8–10 Test matches and 10–15 ODIs, a potential on-field workload of 75 days plus travel and preparation time per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Match officials|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003001326/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|archivedate=3 October 2013}}</ref>

The International Panel is made up of officials nominated from each of the ten Test-playing cricket boards. The Panel Members officiate in ODI matches in their home country, and assist the Elite Panel at peak times in the cricket calendar when they can be appointed to overseas ODI and Test matches. International Panel members also undertake overseas umpiring assignments such as the ICC [[U/19 Cricket World Cup|Under 19 Cricket World Cup]] to improve their knowledge and understanding of overseas conditions, and help them prepare for possible promotion onto the Elite Panel. Some of these umpires also officiate in the Cricket World Cup. Each of the Test cricket boards nominates a "third umpire" who can be called upon to review certain on-field decisions through instant television replays. All third umpires are first-class umpires in their own county, and the role is seen as a step onto the International Panel, and then the Elite Panel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044124/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>

The inaugural ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel was formed in June 2006.
It superseded the ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel, created in 2005, and serves as the pinnacle for umpires from non-Test playing Members, with selection achieved through each of the five ICC Development Program Regional Umpires Panels.
Members of the Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel are eligible for appointments to ODIs involving ICC Associate Members, ICC Intercontinental Cup matches and other Associate and Affiliate tournaments. High-performing umpires may also be considered for other ICC events, including the ICC U/19 Cricket World Cup, and could also be invited to be involved in the ICC Champions Trophy and ICC Cricket World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/89/match-officials/icc-associate-and-affiliate-international-umpires-panel|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602070629/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/89/match-officials/icc-associate-and-affiliate-international-umpires-panel|archivedate=2 June 2016}}</ref>

There is also an [[Elite Panel of ICC Referees]] who act as the independent representative of the ICC at all Test and ODI matches. As of January 2009, it has 6 members, all highly experienced former international cricketers. The Referees do not have the power to report players or officials (which has to be done by the umpires), but they are responsible for conducting hearings under the ICC Code of Conduct and imposing penalties as required at matches, ranging from an official reprimand to a lifetime ban from cricket. Decisions can be appealed, but the original decision is upheld in most cases.

The Council failed to achieve consensus among the cricket playing nations – as of June 2012 – on the universal application of Umpire's Decision Review System, due to opposition by BCCI. It will continue to be applied subject to mutual agreement of the playing countries.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-27/top-stories/32440276_1_drs-ball-tracking-icc-executive-board| title= No decision yet on universal application of DRS

The current sponsor is [[MRF (company)|MRF Tyres]] who signed a 4-year deal with the ICC that will last until 2020.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.icc-cricket.com/news/2016/media-releases/91558/icc-announces-mrf-tyres-as-global-partner | title = ICC announces MRF Tyres as Global Partner | publisher = International Cricket Council | accessdate = 27 January 2016 | date = 20 January 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160523132037/http://www.icc-cricket.com/news/2016/media-releases/91558/icc-announces-mrf-tyres-as-global-partner | archive-date = 23 May 2016 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

==Anti-corruption and security==
The ICC has also had to deal with drugs and [[Betting controversies in cricket|bribery scandals]] involving top cricketers. Following the corruption scandals by cricketers connected with the legal and illegal [[bookmaking]] markets, the ICC set up an Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) in 2000 under the retired [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner]] of the [[London Metropolitan Police]], [[Paul Condon, Baron Condon|Lord Condon]]. Among the corruption on which they have reported was that of former [[South African national cricket captains|South African captain]] [[Hansie Cronje]] who had accepted substantial sums of money from an Indian bookmaker for under-performing or ensuring that certain matches had a pre-determined result. Similarly, the former [[Indian national cricket captains|Indian captain]] [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] and [[Ajay Jadeja]] were investigated, found guilty of match-fixing, and banned from playing cricket (for life and for five years, respectively).  The ACSU continues to monitor and investigate any reports of corruption in cricket and protocols have been introduced, which for example prohibit the use of [[mobile telephone]]s in [[Changeroom|dressing room]]s.

Prior to the 2007 [[Cricket World Cup]] ICC chief executive [[Malcolm Speed]] warned against any corruption and said that the ICC would be vigilant and intolerant against it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20070213/sports/sports3.html |work=The Jamaica Star |title=Speed warns against corruption during World Cup |date=13 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201121545/http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20070213/sports/sports3.html |archivedate=1 February 2009  }}</ref>

Following a [[Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal|scandal that occurred]] during the 2010 Pakistan tour of England, 3 Pakistani players, [[Mohammad Amir]], [[Mohammad Asif (cricketer)|Mohammad Asif]] and [[Salman Butt]] were found to be guilty of spot-fixing, and were banned for 5 years, 7 years and 10 years respectively. On 3 November 2011, jail terms were handed down of 30 months for Butt, one year for Asif, six months for Amir and two years eight months for Majeed, the sports agent that facilitated the bribes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pakistan cricketers and agent jailed for betting scam|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15573463|accessdate=3 November 2011|newspaper=BBC News |date=3 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/03/pakistan-spot-fixing-jail-terms|title=Pakistan spot-fixing players and agent sentenced to lengthy jail terms|date=3 November 2011|work=The Guardian |location=UK|accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/pakistan/8863611/Pakistan-spot-fixing-scandal-convictions-of-Salman-Butt-Mohammad-Asif-and-Mohammad-Amir-just-one-step-on-a-long-road.html|title=Pakistan spot-fixing scandal: convictions of Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir just one step on a long road |date=3 November 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|accessdate=3 November 2011|last1=Kelso |first1=Paul }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/cricketers-jailed-for-matchfixing-6256508.html|title=Cricketers jailed for match-fixing |date=3 November 2011|work=The Independent |location=UK|accessdate=3 November 2011}}</ref>

==Criticism==
In 2015, Sam Collins and [[Jarrod Kimber]] made the documentary ''[[Death of a Gentleman]]'' on the internal organisation of the ICC, saying that the richer member countries were running the organisation to the detriment of the other members.<ref>{{cite news|last=Miller |first=Andrew |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/975353.html|title=Cricket documentary ''Death of a Gentleman'' scoops prestigious Sports Journalists Association award|date=22 February 2016|work=[[ESPN Cricinfo]]|access-date=21 September 2020}}</ref>
