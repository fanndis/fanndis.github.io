Harvard Law School's founding is traditionally linked to the funding of Harvard's first professorship in law, paid for from a bequest from the estate of [[Isaac Royall Jr.]], a colonial American landowner and a slaveholder.

==History ==
===Bequest by Isaac Royall, founding, and relationship with slavery===
Harvard Law School's founding is traced to the establishment of a "law department" at Harvard in 1817.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=https://hls.harvard.edu/content/uploads/2016/03/Shield-Committee-Report.pdf |title=Recommendation to the President and Fellows of Harvard College on the Shield Approved for the Law School |access-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref> Dating the founding to the year of the creation of the law department makes Harvard Law the oldest continuously-operating law school in the nation.

The founding of the law department came two years after the establishment of Harvard's first endowed professorship in law, funded by a bequest from the estate of wealthy slaveowner [[Isaac Royall, Jr.]], in 1817.<ref name="auto1"/> Royall left roughly 1,000 acres of land in Massachusetts to Harvard when he died in exile in Nova Scotia, where he fled as a British loyalist during the [[American Revolution]], in 1781, "to be appropriated towards the endowing a Professor of Laws ... or a Professor of Physick and Anatomy, whichever the said overseers and Corporation [of the college] shall judge to be best."<ref name="ReferenceA">Id.</ref> The value of the land, when fully liquidated in 1809, was $2,938; the [[Harvard Corporation]] allocated $400 from the income generated by those funds to create the Royall Professorship of Law in 1815.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The Royalls were so involved in the slave trade, that "the labor of slaves underwrote the teaching of law in Cambridge."<ref>{{cite web

===Growth and the Langdell curriculum===
By 1827, the school, with one faculty member, was struggling. [[Nathan Dane]], a prominent alumnus of the college, then endowed the Dane Professorship of Law, insisting that it be given to then Supreme Court Justice [[Joseph Story]]. For a while, the school was called "Dane Law School."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1930/1/23/law-school-has-fine-portrait-collection/ |title=LAW SCHOOL HAS FINE PORTRAIT COLLECTION &#124; News &#124; The Harvard Crimson |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=January 23, 1930 |access-date=March 10, 2015}}.  The school is called ''Dane Law School'' in an 1854 letter written by Rev. C.C. Jones to his son, Robert Manson Myers, ed., ''The Children of Pride: A True Story of Georgia and the Civil War'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1972), p. 42.
</ref>  In 1829, John H. Ashmun, son of [[Eli Porter Ashmun]] and brother of [[George Ashmun]], accepted a professorship and closed his [[Northampton Law School]], with many of his students following him to Harvard.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/antiquitieshist00clargoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/antiquitieshist00clargoog/page/n285 277] |quote=john ashmun northampton harvard law school. |title=Antiquities, Historicals and Graduates of Northampton – Solomon Clark – Internet Archive |publisher=Steam Press of Gazette Print. Company |access-date=March 10, 2015|last1=Clark |first1=Solomon |year=1882 }}</ref> Story's belief in the need for an elite law school based on merit and dedicated to public service helped build the school's reputation at the time, although the contours of these beliefs have not been consistent throughout its history. Enrollment remained low through the 19th century as university legal education was considered to be of little added benefit to apprenticeships in legal practice.  After first trying lowered admissions standards, in 1848 HLS eliminated admissions requirements entirely.<ref name=120HarvLR1089>{{cite journal|title=Book Note: Exploring the Organization and Actions of Legal Professions: Honor Seeking and Echoes of Political Revolution|journal=[[Harvard Law Review]]|date=2007|volume=120|page=1089|url=https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/booknote.pdf|access-date=October 25, 2017}}</ref>  In 1869, HLS also eliminated examination requirements.<ref name=120HarvLR1089/>

In the 1870s, under Dean [[Christopher Columbus Langdell]], HLS introduced what has become the standard first-year [[curriculum]] for American law schools – including classes in [[contracts]], [[property]], [[torts]], [[criminal law]], and [[civil procedure]]. At Harvard, Langdell also developed the [[casebook method|case method]] of teaching law, now the dominant [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] model at U.S. law schools.  Langdell's notion that law could be studied as a "science" gave university legal education a reason for being distinct from vocational preparation. Critics at first defended the old lecture method because it was faster and cheaper and made fewer demands on faculty and students. Advocates said the case method had a sounder theoretical basis in scientific research and the inductive method. Langdell's graduates became leading professors at other law schools where they introduced the case method. The method was facilitated by casebooks. From its founding in 1900, the [[Association of American Law Schools]] promoted the case method in law schools that sought [[accreditation]].<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 20462057|title = The Proliferation of Case Method Teaching in American Law Schools: Mr. Langdell's Emblematic "Abomination," 1890-1915|journal = History of Education Quarterly|volume = 46|issue = 2|pages = 192–247|last1 = Kimball|first1 = Bruce A.|year = 2006|doi = 10.1111/j.1748-5959.2006.tb00066.x}}</ref><ref>Bruce A.

===20th century: institutional criticism===
During the 20th century Harvard Law School was known for its competitiveness. For example, [[Bob Berring]] called it "a samurai ring where you can test your swordsmanship against the swordsmanship of the strongest intellectual warriors from around the nation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.top-law-schools.com/berring-interview.html |title=Interview with Former Dean Robert Berring of U.C. Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law |publisher=Top-law-schools.com |access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref> When Langdell developed the original law school curriculum, Harvard President [[Charles William Eliot|Charles Eliot]] told him to make it "hard and long."<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://paulcarrington.com/Harvard%20Law%20School%20Oral%20History.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218062635/http://paulcarrington.com/Harvard%20Law%20School%20Oral%20History.htm |date=February 18, 2012 }}</ref><ref name="autogenerated3">[http://paulcarrington.com/Learning%20Law%20in%20New%20Haven.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218062629/http://paulcarrington.com/Learning%20Law%20in%20New%20Haven.htm |date=February 18, 2012 }}</ref> An urban legend holds that incoming students are told to "Look to your left, look to your right, because one of you won't be here by the end of the year."<ref>{{Citation |first=Richard D. |last=Kahlenberg |title=Broken Contract: A Memoir of Harvard Law School |year=1992 |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |isbn=978-0-8090-3165-8 }}</ref> [[Scott Turow]]'s memoir ''[[One L]]'' and [[John Jay Osborn, Jr.|John Jay Osborn]]'s novel ''[[The Paper Chase (novel)|The Paper Chase]]'' describe such an environment.

In addition, Eleanor Kerlow's book ''Poisoned Ivy: How Egos, Ideology, and Power Politics Almost Ruined Harvard Law School'' criticized the school for a 1980s political dispute between newer and older faculty members over accusations of insensitivity to minority and feminist issues. Divisiveness over such issues as [[political correctness]] lent the school the title "Beirut on the Charles."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legaled.com/revolution.htm|title=www|website=www.legaled.com|access-date=December 17, 2017}}</ref>

In ''Broken Contract: A Memoir of Harvard Law School,'' Richard Kahlenberg criticized the school for driving students away from public interest and toward work in high-paying law firms. Kahlenberg's criticisms are supported by Granfield and Koenig's study, which found that "students [are directed] toward service in the most prestigious law firms, both because they learn that such positions are their destiny and because the recruitment network that results from collective eminence makes these jobs extremely easy to obtain."<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The school has also been criticized for its large first year class sizes (at one point there were 140 students per classroom; in 2001 there were 80), a cold and aloof administration,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4D71131F935A25757C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Harvard Law Tries to Increase Appeal | first=Jonathan D. | last=Glater | date=April 16, 2001 | access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref> and an inaccessible faculty. The latter stereotype is a central plot element of ''The Paper Chase'' and appears in ''[[Legally Blonde]]''.

In response to the above criticisms, HLS eventually implemented the once-criticized<ref name="autogenerated3" /> but now dominant approach pioneered by Dean [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|Robert Hutchins]] at [[Yale Law School]], of shifting the competitiveness to the admissions process while making law school itself a more cooperative experience. Robert Granfield and Thomas Koenig's 1992 study of Harvard Law students that appeared in ''The Sociological Quarterly'' found that students "learn to cooperate with rather than compete against classmates," and that contrary to "less eminent" law schools, students "learn that professional success is available for all who attend, and that therefore, only neurotic 'gunners' try to outdo peers."<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Citation |first=Robert |last=Granfield |first2=Thomas |last2=Koenig |year=2005 |title=Learning Collective Eminence: Harvard Law School and the Social Production of Elite Lawyers |journal=Sociological Quarterly |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=503–20 |doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1992.tb00140.x }}</ref>

Under Kagan, the second half of the 2000s saw significant academic changes since the implementation of the Langdell curriculum. In 2006, the faculty voted unanimously to approve a new first-year curriculum, placing greater emphasis on problem-solving, administrative law, and international law. The new curriculum was implemented in stages over the next several years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/2008/winter/feature_1.php |title=Issues Archive &#124; Harvard Law Today |publisher=Law.harvard.edu |access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/07/education/07harvard.html | work=The New York Times | title=Harvard Law Decides to Steep Students in 21st-Century Issues | first=Jonathan D. | last=Glater | date=October 7, 2006 | access-date=May 4, 2010}}</ref> with the last new course, a first year practice-oriented problem solving workshop, being instituted in January 2010. In late 2008, the faculty decided that the school should move to an Honors/Pass/Low Pass/Fail (H/P/LP/F) grading system, much like those in place at Yale and Stanford Law Schools. The system applied to half the courses taken by students in the Class of 2010 and fully started with the Class of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mystal |first=Elie |url=http://abovethelaw.com/2008/10/hls-grade-reform-splitting-the-baby-was-the-only-call/ |title=HLS Grade Reform: Splitting the Baby Was The Only Call |publisher=Above the Law |access-date=March 10, 2015}}</ref>

In 2009, Kagan was appointed [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general of the United States]] by President [[Barack Obama]] and resigned the deanship. On June 11, 2009, Harvard University president, [[Drew Gilpin Faust]] named [[Martha Minow]] as the new dean. She assumed the position on July 1, 2009.

==Shield retirement==
In 2016, the governing body of the university, the [[Harvard Corporation]], voted to retire the law school's 80 year old arms. The arms, depicting three garbs (the [[heraldry|heraldic]] term for wheat sheaves), was based in part upon the [[coat of arms]] of [[Isaac Royall Jr.]], a university benefactor who had endowed the first professorship in the law school. The shield had become a source of contention among a group of law school students, who objected to the Royall family's history as slave-owners.<ref>[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/03/14/harvard-law-school-ditch-controversial-shield-with-elements-from-slave-owning-family/UIYgbyviFdwwGKjexZgWqN/story.html Harvard Law School to ditch controversial shield] Steve Annear.

==In popular culture==

===Books===
''[[The Paper Chase (novel)|The Paper Chase]]'' is a novel set amid a student's first ("One L") year at the school. It was written by [[John Jay Osborn, Jr.]], who studied at the school. The book was later turned into a film and a television series (see below).

[[Scott Turow]] wrote a memoir of his experience as a first-year law student at Harvard, ''[[One L]]''.

===Film and television===
Several movies and television shows take place at least in part at the school. Most of them have scenes filmed on location at or around Harvard University. They include:
* ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'' (1970)
* ''[[The Paper Chase (film)|The Paper Chase]]'' (1973)
* ''[[The Paper Chase (TV series)|The Paper Chase]]'' (1978–1979, 1983–1986 television series)
* ''[[Soul Man (film)|Soul Man]]'' (1986)
* ''[[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]]'' (1993)
* ''[[A Civil Action (film)|A Civil Action]]'' (1998)
* ''[[How High]]'' (2001)
* ''[[Legally Blonde]]'' (2001)
* ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (2002)
* ''[[Love Story in Harvard]]'' (2004 Korean TV series)
* ''[[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits (TV Series)]]'' (2011–2019)
* ''[[On the Basis of Sex]]'' (2018)
Many popular movies and television shows also feature characters introduced as Harvard Law School graduates. The central plot point of the TV series ''[[Suits (U.S. TV series)|Suits]]'' is that one of the main characters did not attend Harvard but fakes his graduate status in order to practice law.
