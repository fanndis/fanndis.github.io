The '''premiership of Tony Blair''' began on 2 May 1997 and ended upon his resignation on 27 June 2007. Whilst serving as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[Tony Blair]] concurrently served as the [[First Lord of the Treasury]], the [[Minister for the Civil Service]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] (until [[Gordon Brown]] was declared [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leader on 24 June 2007) and the Member of Parliament for [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]]. He remains a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]], having first been appointed in July 1994 when he became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Blair is the Labour Party's longest-serving Prime Minister, the only Labour Prime Minister to have led the party to victory since 1974, and—having led the party to three consecutive general election victories—also the only Labour Prime Minister to serve two full consecutive terms. Blair is both credited with and criticised for moving the Labour Party closer to the [[Centrism|centre]] of British politics, using the term "[[New Labour]]" to distinguish his pro-[[free market|market]] policies from the more [[Democratic socialism|socialist]] policies which the party had espoused in the past.

In domestic government policy, Blair significantly increased [[Public finance|public spending]] on healthcare and education while also introducing controversial market-based reforms in these areas. In addition, Blair's tenure saw the introduction of a [[minimum wage]], tuition fees for higher education, [[Constitutional amendment|constitutional reform]] such as [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution in Scotland and Wales]] and progress in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]]. The UK economy performed well and the real incomes of Britons grew 18% during 1997–2006. Blair kept to [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] commitments not to increase income tax in the first term although rates of employee's [[National Insurance]] (a [[payroll tax|payroll levy]]) were increased. He also presided over a significant expansion of the welfare state during his time in office, which led to a significant reduction in relative poverty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/bns/bn73.pdf |title=Poverty and inequality in the UK: 2007 |accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref>

Blair ardently supported [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|United States foreign policy]], notably by participating in the invasions of [[#War in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] in 2001 and [[#War in Iraq|Iraq]] in 2003.

On 7 September 2006, Blair publicly stated he would step down as party leader by the time of the [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] conference in September 2007. On 10 May 2007, he announced his intention to resign as UK Prime Minister on 27 June 2007.

==First term (1997–2001)==

===Independence for the Bank of England===
Immediately after taking office, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] gave the [[Bank of England]] the power to set the UK base [[Interest|rate of interest]] autonomously, as agreed in 1992 in the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. This decision was popular with the British financial establishment in London, which the Labour Party had been courting since the early-1990s. Together with the Government's decision to remain within projected Conservative [[budget|spending limit]]s for its first two years in office, it helped to reassure sceptics of the Labour Party's fiscal "prudence".  Associated changes moved regulation of banks away from the Bank of England to the Financial Services Authority- and these changes were unwound in 2013 following perceived failures by the FSA in the banking crisis.

===Euro===
{{See also|United Kingdom and the euro}}
The Blair ministry decided against joining the [[Eurozone]], and adopting the [[euro]] as the currency to replace the [[pound sterling]]. This decision was generally supported by the British public, and by all political parties in the UK, as well as the media.

On 24 June 1998, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' had famously put the front-page headline "Is THIS the most dangerous man in Britain?" beside a photograph of Blair, when it was still uncertain whether he would lead Britain into the Euro, or keep the [[Pound sterling|sterling]] currency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ThhguC97EdA/SYl5pT_Ut4I/AAAAAAAAAcc/jup95SP_iTM/s1600-h/BLAIR-DANGEROUS-MAN.jpg |title=BLAIR-DANGEROUS-MAN.jpg (image) |publisher=1.bp.blogspot.com |accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref>

===Domestic politics===
In the early years of his first term, Blair relied on political advice from a close circle of his staff, among whom was his [[press secretary]] and official spokesman [[Alastair Campbell]]. Campbell was permitted to give orders to civil servants, who had previously taken instructions only from ministers. Unlike some of his predecessors, Campbell was a political appointee and had not come up through the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]]. Despite his overtly political role, he was paid from [[Public funding|public funds]] as a civil servant. Also in Blair's team were a number of strong female aides, who acted as gatekeepers and go-betweens, including [[Anji Hunter]], [[Kate Garvey]], [[Ruth Turner (political advisor)|Ruth Turner]] and [[Sally Morgan, Baroness Morgan of Huyton|Sally Morgan]].<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/may/12/women.labour |title=Behind closed doors |author=Decca Aitkenhead |journal=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 May 2005}}</ref>

[[File:TonyBlairArmagh1998.jpg|thumb|Blair in Armagh, Northern Ireland, September 1998]]
A significant achievement of Blair's first term was the signing, on 10 April 1998, of the [[Belfast Agreement]], more commonly referred to as the "Good Friday Agreement". In the Good Friday Agreement, most Northern Irish political parties, together with the UK and Irish Governments, agreed upon an "exclusively peaceful and democratic" framework for the governance of Northern Ireland and a new set of political institutions for the province. In November 1998, Blair became the first UK Prime Minister to address [[Dáil Éireann]].
[[Image:Parliament debating chamber 2.jpg|thumb|left|The Scottish Parliament Building in Holyrood]]

Blair's first term saw an extensive programme of changes to the constitution. The [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] was introduced in 1998; a [[Scottish Parliament]] and a [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh Assembly]] were established following referenda held with a majority voting in favour; most hereditary [[Peerage|peers]] were removed from the [[House of Lords]] in [[House of Lords Act 1999|1999]]; the [[Greater London Authority]] and the position of [[Mayor of London]] were established in 2000; and the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] was passed later in the same year, with its provisions coming into effect over the following decade. This last Act disappointed campaigners {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}, whose hopes had been raised by a 1998 [[White Paper]] which had promised more robust legislation.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} Blair later described the FoIA as one of his "biggest regrets",<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-end-of-foi-right-to-know-in-peril-as-government-targets-freedom-of-information-10397935.html|title = The end of FoI?

Significant change took place to legislation relating to rights of [[homosexuality|lesbian, gay, bisexual]] and [[transgender]] people during Blair's period in office. During his first term, the [[age of consent]] for homosexuals was equalised at sixteen years of age (see [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]]) and the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces was lifted. Subsequently, in 2005, a [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|Civil Partnership]] Act came into effect, allowing gay couples to form legally recognised partnerships with the same rights as a traditional heterosexual marriage. At the end of September 2006, more than 30,000 Britons had entered into Civil Partnerships as a result of this law.<ref>{{cite web | title = Civil Partnerships: Over 18,000 formed by December 2006| url = http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=1685|publisher = [[Office for National Statistics]]| date = 28 June 2007| accessdate = 30 June 2007}}</ref> Adoption by same-sex couples was legalised, and discrimination in the workplace ([[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003]]), and in relation to the provision of goods and services ([[Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations]]) were both made illegal. Transgender people were given the right to change their [[birth certificate]] to reflect their new gender as a result of the [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]].

Tony Blair's touch was less sure with regard to the [[Millennium Dome]] project. The incoming government greatly expanded the size of the project and consequently increased expectations of what would be delivered. Just before its opening, Blair claimed the Dome would be "a triumph of confidence over cynicism, boldness over blandness, excellence over mediocrity".<ref>{{cite news | title = Countdown of controversy| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/1009660.stm|work = BBC News| date = 29 May 2002| accessdate = 18 November 2006}}</ref> In the words of BBC correspondent [[Robert Orchard]], "the Dome was to be highlighted as a glittering New Labour achievement in the next election manifesto".<ref>{{cite news | title = Dome woes haunt Blair | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1172367.stm  | work = BBC News | date = 15 February 2001 | accessdate = 18 November 2006}}</ref>

===Social policies===
During his first term as Prime Minister, Blair raised taxes; introduced a [[National Minimum Wage]] and some new employment rights; introduced significant constitutional reforms; promoted new rights for gay people in the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004]]; and signed treaties integrating the UK more closely with the EU. He introduced substantial market-based reforms in the education and health sectors; introduced student [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]]; sought to reduce certain categories of welfare payments, and introduced tough anti-terrorism and [[Identity Cards Act 2006|identity card legislation]]. Under Blair's government, the amount of new legislation increased<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sweetandmaxwell.thomson.com/about-us/press-releases/010607.pdf |title=Tony Blair's legacy: 20% jump in amount of legislation introduced per year|date=1 June 2007 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref> which attracted criticism.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/blairs-frenzied-law-making–a-new-offence-for-every-day-spent-in-office-412072.html Blair's 'frenzied law making' : a new offence for every day spent in office 16 August 2006].

According to one study, in terms of promoting social equality, the first Blair Government "turned out to be the most redistributive in decades; it ran [[Harold Wilson]]'s 1960s' government close." From 1997-2005, for instance, all the benefits targeted on children through Tax Credits, Child Benefit and Income Support had gone up by 72% in real terms. Improvements were also made in financial support to pensioners, and by 2004, the poorest third of pensioners were £1,750 a year better off than under the system as it used to be. As a means of reducing energy costs and therefore the incidence of [[fuel poverty]], a new programme of grants for cavity wall and loft insulation and for draught proofing was launched, with some 670,000 homes taking up the scheme. Various adjustments were also made in social welfare benefits. Families were allowed to earn a little more before Housing Benefit was cut, and the benefit was raised for families where the main earner worked part-time, while 2,000,000 pensioners were offered automatic help with their council tax bills, worth £400 each, although many did not take advantage of this benefit. According to one study, the Blair ministry's record on benefits, taken in the round, was "unprecedented," with 3.7% real terms growth each year from 2002-2005.<ref name="ReferenceA">Better of Worse? Has Labour Delivered? By Polly Toynbee and David Walker</ref>

Under the years of the Blair ministry, expenditure on social services was increased, while various anti-poverty measures were introduced. From 2001-2005, public spending increased by an average of 4.8% in real terms, while spending on transport went up by 8.5% per annum, health by 8.2% per annum, and education by 5.4% per annum. Between 1997-2005, child poverty was more than halved in absolute terms as a result of measures such as the extension of maternity pay, increases in child benefit, and by the growth in the numbers of people in employment. During that same period, the number of pensioners living in poverty fell by over 75% in absolute terms as a result of initiatives such as the introduction of Winter Fuel Payments, the reduction of VAT on fuel, and the introduction of a Minimum Income Guarantee. To reduce poverty traps for those making the transition from welfare to work, a minimum wage was established, together with a Working Tax Credit and a Child Tax Credit. Together with various tax credit schemes to supplement low earnings, the Blair Government's policies significantly increased the earnings of the lowest income decile.<ref name="ReferenceJ">Ten Years of New Labour edited by Matt Beech and Simon Lee</ref> In addition, under the Working Time Regulations of 1998, British workers gained a statutory entitlement to paid holidays.<ref>{{cite book|last=al.]|first=Nancy Falchikov ; with contributions by Margo Blythman ... [et|title=Learning together : peer tutoring in higher education|year=2001|publisher=RoutledgeFalmer|location=London|isbn=0415182603|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JlfESjsknSIC&pg=PA166|edition=Transferred to digital printing.}}</ref>

Between 1997-2003, spending on early years education and childcare rose in real terms from £2.0 billion to £3.6 billion. During Blair's first term in office, 100 "Early Excellence" centres opened, together with new nurseries, while 500 Sure Start projects began. Although the number of children fell, the amount of state support to families with children increased, with money paid only to them (child contingent support) going up by 52% in real terms from 1999–2005. The Blair ministry also extended to three-year-olds the right to a free nursery place for half a day Monday to Friday. Tax credits assisted some 300,000 families (at January 2004) with childcare costs, while the 2004 budget exempted the first £50 of weekly payments to nannies and childminders from tax and National Insurance, restricted to couples earning not more than £43,000 per annum. The [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]] extended a legal right to walk to about 3,200 square miles of open countryside, mainly in the North of England.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

During its first year in office, the Blair Government made the controversial decision of cutting Lone Parent Benefit, which led to abstentions amongst many Labour MPs. In March 1998, however, Brown responded in his Budget statement by increasing child benefit by £2.50 a week above the rate of inflation, the largest ever increase in the benefit. Public expenditure on education, health, and social security rose more rapidly under the Blair government than it did under previous Labour governments, the latter due to initiatives such as the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit and increases in pensions and child benefits. During the Blair Government's time in office, incomes for the bottom 10% of earners increased as a result of transfers through the social security system.<ref name="ReferenceJ"/>

New rights for workers were introduced such as extended parental rights, a significant raising of the maximum compensation figure for unfair dismissal, a restoration of the qualifying period for protection against unfair dismissal to twelve months, and the right to be accompanied by a trade union official during a disciplinary or grievance hearing, whether or not a trade union is recognised. In addition, an Employee Relation Act was passed which introduced for the first time ever, the legal right of employees to trade union representation. In 2003, the Working Families Tax Credit was split into two benefits: a Working Tax Credit which was payable to all those in work, and a Child Tax Credit which was payable to all families with children, whether in work or not.<ref name="ReferenceJ"/> During Blair's time in office, over 2,000,000 people had been lifted out of poverty.<ref name="ReferenceJ"/>

A proportional voting system was introduced for the election of Britain's MEPs, while legislation changing executive structures in local government was passed. Regional Development Agencies were set up in the 8 English regions outside London, and changes were made to the regulation of political parties and referendums, with the introduction of a new Electoral Commission and stricter spending rules. In addition, voting experiments resulted in an opening up of postal voting and reform of electoral registration, while the right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords was abolished after 700 years. In addition, the [[Water Industries Act 1999]] ended the right of water companies to disconnect supplies "as a sanction against non-payment."<ref>Transforming Britain: Labour’s Second Term edited by Adrian Harvey</ref>

The [[Employment Act 2002]] extended rights to paternity, maternity, and adoption leave and pay, while the [[Police Reform Act 2002]] established community support officers and reorganised national intelligence gathering. The [[Adoption and Children Act 2002]] enabled unmarried couples to apply to adopt while speeding up adoption procedures, while the [[Private Hire Vehicles (Carriage of Guide Dogs) Act 2002]] banned charges for guide dogs in minicabs. The [[International Development Act 2002]] required spending to be used to reduce poverty and improve the welfare of the poor. The [[Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Act 2002]] equalised the age at which men and women become entitled to travel concessions. Under the [[Homelessness Act 2002]], councils had to adopt homelessness strategies and do more for those homeless through no fault of their own, and the [[Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002]] made it easier to convert long-term residential leasehold into freehold through "commonhold" tenures. The [[British Overseas Territories Act 2002]] extended full British citizenship to 200,000 inhabitants of 14 British Overseas Territories, while the [[Office of Communications Act 2002]] set up a new regulatory body known as the Office of Communications (Ofcom). The [[Enterprise Act 2002]] included measures to safeguard consumers, while also reforming bankruptcy and establishing a stronger Office of Fair Trading.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Immigration===
Non-European immigration rose significantly during the period from 1997, not least because of the [[First Blair ministry|government]]'s abolition of the primary purpose rule in June 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/news/06/0605/straw.shtml|title=BBC Politics 97}}</ref> This change made it easier for UK residents to bring foreign spouses into the country.
The former government advisor Andrew Neather in the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' stated that the deliberate policy of ministers from late-2000 until early-2008 was to open up the UK to mass migration.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23760073-dont-listen-to-the-whingers---london-needs-immigrants.do |title=Don't listen to the whingers – London needs immigrants |first=Andrew |last=Neather |work=Evening Standard |location=London |date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=26 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202101114/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23760073-dont-listen-to-the-whingers---london-needs-immigrants.do |archive-date=2 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/6418456/Labour-wanted-mass-immigration-to-make-UK-more-multicultural-says-former-adviser.html |title=Labour wanted mass immigration to make UK more multicultural, says former adviser |first=Tom |last=Whitehead |work=Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=28 October 2009}}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
In 1999, Blair planned and presided over the declaration of the [[Kosovo War]]. While in opposition, the Labour Party had criticised the Conservatives for their perceived weakness during the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]n war, and Blair was among those urging a strong line by [[NATO]] against [[Slobodan Milošević]]. Blair was criticised both by those on the left who opposed the war <ref>{{Cite book|last=Nikolaev|first=Alexander G.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dejFAAAAQBAJ&q=Blair+was+criticised+both+by+those+on+the+left+who+opposed+the+kosovo+war&pg=PA92|title=Leading to the 2003 Iraq War: The Global Media Debate|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2006|isbn=978-1-349-53280-3|location=New York|pages=92}}</ref> in principle and by some others who believed that the Serbs were fighting a legitimate war of [[Self-defense|self-defence]]. One month into the war, on 22 April 1999, Blair made a speech in [[Chicago]] setting out his "Doctrine of the International Community".<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/international/jan-june99/blair_doctrine4-23.html| title = The Blair Doctrine| accessdate = 18 November 2006| date = 22 April 1999| work = Online Focus| publisher = MacNeil/Lehrer Productions}}</ref> This later became known by the media as the "[[Blair doctrine]]", and played a part in Blair's decision to order the [[British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War]] in May 2000.

Another significant change in 1997 was the creation of the [[Department for International Development]], shifting global development policy away from the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] to an independent ministry with a Cabinet-level minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgdev.org/files/4371_file_WP_70.pdf |title=Lessons from the UK Experience |accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref>

Also in 1999, Blair was awarded the [[Charlemagne Prize]] by the German city of [[Aachen]] for his contributions to the European ideal and to peace in Europe.

==Second term (2001–2005)==
[[File:Bush Blair at Chequers.jpg|thumb|Blair welcoming [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] to [[Chequers]] on 19 July 2001]]
In the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] campaign, Blair emphasised the theme of improving [[public service]]s, notably the [[National Health Service]] and the State [[Education|education system]]. The Conservatives concentrated on opposing British membership of [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|the Euro]], which did little to win over [[floating voter]]s. The Labour Party retained its large parliamentary majority, and Blair became the first Labour Prime Minister to win a full second term. However, the election was notable for a large fall in [[voter turnout]].

===War in Afghanistan===
{{Main|War in Afghanistan (2001–present)}}
Following the [[11 September 2001]] attacks on New York City and Washington DC, Blair was very quick to align the UK with the United States, engaging in a round of [[shuttle diplomacy]] to help form and maintain an international coalition prior to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 war against Afghanistan]]. He maintains his diplomatic activity to this day, showing a willingness to visit countries that other world leaders might consider too dangerous to visit. In 2003, he became the first Briton since [[Winston Churchill]] to be awarded a [[Congressional Gold Medal]] by the [[United States Congress]] for being "a staunch and steadfast ally of the United States of America",<ref>{{cite web

In 2003, Blair was also awarded an [[Ellis Island Medal of Honor]] for his support of the United States after 9/11—the first non-American to receive the honour.<ref>{{cite news| title = US to award Blair for leadership|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2954567.stm| work = BBC News| date =16 April 2003 |accessdate =18 November 2006}}</ref>

===War in Iraq===
{{Main|2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War}}
Blair gave strong support to US President [[George W. Bush]]'s invasion of Iraq in 2003. He soon became the face of international support for the war, often clashing with French President [[Jacques Chirac]], who became the face of international opposition. Widely regarded as a more persuasive speaker than Bush, Blair gave many speeches arguing for the overthrow of [[Saddam Hussein]] in the days leading up to the invasion.

Blair's case for war was based on Iraq's alleged possession of [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] and consequent violation of [[United Nations resolution|UN resolutions]]. He was wary of making direct appeals for [[regime change]], since [[international law]] does not recognise this as a ground for war. A [[Downing Street memo|memorandum from a July 2002 meeting]] that was leaked in April 2005 showed that Blair believed that the British public would support regime change in the right political context; the document, however, stated that legal grounds for such action were weak. On 24 September 2002, the UK Government published a [[September Dossier|dossier]] based on the intelligence agencies' assessments of [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq's weapons of mass destruction]]. Among the items in the dossier was a recently received intelligence report that "the Iraqi military are able to deploy chemical or [[Biological warfare|biological weapons]] within 45 minutes of an order to do so". A further briefing paper on Iraq's alleged WMDs was issued to journalists in February 2003. This document was discovered to have taken a large part of its text without attribution from a PhD thesis available on the internet. Where the thesis hypothesised about possible WMDs, the [[Downing Street]] version presented the ideas as fact. The document subsequently became known as the "[[Dodgy Dossier]]".<ref>{{cite news |title=Downing St apologises for dodgy dossier |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/domestic_politics/downing+st+apologises+for+dodgy+dossier/257243 |publisher=Channel 4 |date=8 June 2003 |accessdate=30 June 2007}}</ref>

46,000 British troops, one-third of the total strength of the [[British Army]] (land forces), were deployed to assist with the invasion of Iraq. When after the war, no Weapons of Mass Destruction were found in Iraq, the two dossiers, together with Blair's other pre-war statements, became an issue of considerable controversy. Many Labour Party members, including a number who had supported the war, were among the critics. Successive independent inquiries (including those by the Foreign Affairs [[Select Committee (United Kingdom)|Select Committee]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the senior judge [[Hutton Inquiry|Lord Hutton]], and the former senior civil servant [[Butler Review|Lord Butler of Brockwell]]) have found that Blair honestly stated what he believed to be true at the time, though Lord Butler's report did imply{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} that the Government's presentation of the intelligence evidence had been subject to some degree of exaggeration. These findings have not prevented frequent accusations that Blair was deliberately deceitful, and, during the [[2005 United Kingdom general election#Campaign|2005 election campaign]], Conservative leader Michael Howard made [[political capital]] out of the issue.

Then Secretary General of the United Nations, [[Kofi Annan]], stated in September 2004 that the invasion was "illegal", but did not state the legal basis for this assertion. Prior to the war, the UK Attorney General [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]], who acts as the Government's legal advisor, had advised Blair that the war was legal.

[[British Armed Forces]] were active in southern Iraq to stabilise the country in the run-up to the [[Politics of Iraq|Iraqi elections]] of January 2005. In October 2004, the UK government agreed to a request from US forces to send a battalion of the [[Black Watch]] regiment to the American sector to free up [[United States Armed Forces|US troops]] for an assault on [[Fallujah]]. The subsequent deployment of the Black Watch was criticised by some in Britain on the grounds that its alleged ultimate purpose was to assist George Bush's re-election{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 US presidential election]]. As of September 2006, 7,500 British forces remain in Southern Iraq, around the city of [[Basra]]. After the presidential election, Blair tried to use his relationship with President Bush to persuade the US to devote efforts to resolving the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].

In an interview with [[David Frost]] on [[Al Jazeera]] in November 2006, Blair appeared to agree with Frost's assessment that the war had been "pretty much of a disaster", although a Downing Street spokesperson denied that this was an accurate reflection of Blair's view.<ref>{{cite news |title=Blair accepts 'disaster' in Iraq |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6160466.stm |work=BBC News |date=18 November 2006 |accessdate=27 November 2006}}</ref>

===Domestic politics===
After fighting the 2001 general election on the theme of improving public services, Blair's government raised taxes in 2002 (described by the Conservatives as "[[stealth tax]]es") to increase spending on education and health. Blair insisted the increased funding would have to be matched by [[quasi-market|internal reforms]]. The government introduced the [[NHS foundation trust|Foundation Hospital]]s scheme to allow NHS hospitals financial autonomy, although the eventual shape of the proposals, after an internal Labour Party struggle with [[Gordon Brown]], allowed for less freedom than Blair had wished.  But with the supply of healthcare services increasing less quickly than demand, benefits from the NHS have not yet increased to the same degree, and the NHS had an £800,000,000 deficit for the 2005/6 financial year.

The [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace process]] in Northern Ireland hit a series of problems. In October 2002, the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] established under the Good Friday Agreement was suspended. Attempts to persuade the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] to decommission its weapons were unsuccessful, and, in the second set of elections to the Assembly in November 2003, the staunchly unionist [[Democratic Unionist Party]] replaced the more moderate [[Ulster Unionist Party]] as Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, making a return to devolved government more difficult. At the same time, [[Sinn Féin]] replaced the more moderate [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]] as the province's largest nationalist party.

In its first term, the government had introduced an annual fixed [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fee]] of around £1,000 for higher education students (rejecting requests from universities to be allowed to vary the fee), with reductions and exemptions for poorer students. At the same time, the remaining student maintenance grant was replaced with a low-interest loan, which was to be repaid once the student was earning over a certain threshold. In 2003, Blair introduced legislation permitting universities to charge variable fees of up to £3,000 per year. At the same time, the repayment of [[student loan]]s was delayed until the graduate's income was much higher, and grants were reintroduced for some students from poorer backgrounds. It was claimed the increase in university fees violated a promise in Labour's 2001 general election manifesto, though this claim is arguably unsustainable if the relevant promise is interpreted strictly and literally. At its [[second reading]] in the House of Commons in January 2004, the [[Higher Education Act 2004|Higher Education Bill]] which contained the changes was passed with a majority of only five votes, due to a large-scale backbench Labour rebellion. A defeat was averted by a last-minute change of intention by a small number of Gordon Brown's backbench allies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.

[[Image:bliar.jpg|thumb|right|Effigy of Tony Blair from a 2003 [[anti-war]] demonstration against the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]]]]
On 1 August 2003, Blair became the longest continuously-serving Labour Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, surpassing [[Clement Attlee]]'s six-year term from 1945–51.

The [[Hutton Inquiry]] into the death of [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|Dr. David Kelly]] reported on 2 August, ruled that he had committed suicide, and despite widespread expectations that the report would criticise Blair and his government, Hutton cleared the Government of deliberately inserting false intelligence into the [[September Dossier]], while criticising the [[BBC]] editorial process which had allowed unfounded allegations to be broadcast. Evidence to the inquiry raised further questions over the use of intelligence in the run-up to the war, and the report did not satisfy opponents of Blair and of the war. After a similar decision by President Bush, Blair set up another inquiry—the [[Butler Review]]—into the accuracy and presentation of the intelligence relating to Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction. Opponents of the war, especially the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], refused to participate in this inquiry, since it did not meet their demands for a full [[public inquiry]] into whether the war was justified {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}.

The political fallout from the Iraq War continued to dog Blair's premiership after the Butler Review. On 25 August 2004, [[Plaid Cymru]] MP [[Adam Price]] announced he would attempt to impeach Blair,<ref>{{cite news | title = Blair impeachment campaign starts| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3600438.stm | work = BBC News| date = 27 August 2004|accessdate = 18 November 2006}}</ref> hoping to invoke a [[Parliamentary procedure]] that has lain dormant for 150 years but has never been abolished. However, of 640 MPs in the House of Commons only 23 backed the Commons motion—officially known as an [[Early day motion]]—in support of considering "whether there exist sufficient grounds to impeach" Blair (a 24th MP signed the motion but later withdrew his name). The Early Day Motion has now expired.

{{Main|Impeach Blair campaign}}
In April 2004, Blair announced that a [[United Kingdom European Constitution referendum|referendum]] would be held on the ratification of the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|EU Constitution]]. This represented a significant development in British politics: only one nationwide referendum had previously been held (in 1975, on [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|whether the UK should remain in the EEC]]), though a referendum had been promised if the Government decided to join the Euro, and referendums had been held on devolved structures of government in [[Scottish Government|Scotland]], Wales and Northern Ireland. It was a dramatic change of policy for Blair, who had previously dismissed calls for a referendum unless the constitution fundamentally altered the UK's relationship with the EU. [[Michael Howard]] seized upon this "EU-turn", reminding Blair of his declaration to the 2003 Labour Party conference that "I can only go one way. I haven't got a reverse gear". The referendum was expected to be held in early 2006; however, after the French and Dutch rejections of the constitution, the Blair government announced it was suspending plans for a referendum for the foreseeable future.

During his second term, Blair was increasingly the target for protests. His speech to the 2004 Labour Party conference, for example, was interrupted both by a protester against the Iraq War and by a group that opposed the government's decision to allow the House of Commons to ban [[fox hunting]].

On 15 September 2004, Blair delivered a speech on the environment and the 'urgent issue' of [[climate change]]. In unusually direct language he concluded that "If what the science tells us about climate change is correct, then unabated it will result in catastrophic consequences for our world ... The science, almost certainly, is correct." The action he proposed to take appeared to be based on business and investment rather than legislative or tax-based attempts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions: "it is possible to combine reducing emissions with economic growth ... investment in science and technology and in the businesses associated with it".<ref>{{cite news | title = Full text: Blair's climate change speech | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/green/story/0,9061,1305030,00.html | work = The Guardian | publisher = Guardian Newspapers Ltd. | date = 15 September 2004 | accessdate = 18 November 2006 | location=London}}</ref>

===Health problems===
On 19 October 2003, it emerged Blair had received treatment for an [[Cardiac arrhythmia|irregular heartbeat]]. Having felt ill the previous day, he went to hospital and was diagnosed with [[supraventricular tachycardia]]. This was treated by [[cardioversion]] and he returned home that night. He was reported to have taken the following day (20 October) more gently than usual and returned to a full schedule on 21 October. Downing Street aides later suggested the palpitations had been brought on by drinking lots of strong coffee at an EU summit and then working-out vigorously in the gym. However, former minister [[Lewis Moonie, Baron Moonie|Lewis Moonie]], a doctor, said the treatment was more serious than [[10 Downing Street|Number 10]] had admitted: "Anaesthetising somebody and giving their heart electric shocks is not something you just do in the routine run of medical practice."

In September 2004, in off-the-cuff remarks during an interview with [[ITV News]], [[Melvyn Bragg|Lord Bragg]] said Blair was "under colossal strain" over "considerations of his family" and that Blair had thought "things over very carefully." This led to speculation Blair would resign. Although details of a family problem were known by the press, no paper reported them because according to one journalist, to have done so would have breached "the bounds of privacy and [[media responsibility]]."<ref>{{cite news | first = Peter  | last = Fray | title = Keeping Tony Blair's secret all in the family | url = http://theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/17/1095394005096.html  | work = The Agree | publisher = The Age Company Ltd. | date = 18 September 2004 | accessdate = 18 November 2006 | location=Melbourne}}</ref>

Blair underwent a [[catheter ablation]] to correct his irregular heartbeat on 1 October 2004, after announcing the procedure on the previous day, in a series of interviews in which he also declared he would seek a third term as Prime Minister, but not a fourth.<ref>{{cite news| title = Blair heart treatment 'successful'| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3705684.stm| work = BBC News| date = 1 October 2004|accessdate = 18 November 2006}}</ref> The planned procedure was carried out at London's [[Hammersmith Hospital]].

==Third term (2005–2007)==
The Labour Party won the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] held on Thursday 5 May and a third consecutive term in office, for the first time ever. However, Labour won fewer votes in England than the Conservatives. The next day, Blair was invited to form a government by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]. The reduction in the Labour Party's majority (from 167 to 66 seats) and the low share of the popular vote (35%) led to some Labour MPs calling for Blair to leave office sooner rather than later; among them was [[Frank Dobson]], who had served in Blair's cabinet during his first term. However, dissenting voices quickly vanished as Blair took on European leaders over the future direction of the [[European Union]] in June 2005. This election also marks the most recent victory by the Labour Party.

===G8 and EU presidencies===
The rejection by [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]] of the treaty to establish a constitution for the European Union presented Blair with an opportunity to postpone a UK referendum and Foreign Secretary [[Jack Straw]] announced that the Parliamentary Bill to enact a referendum was suspended indefinitely. It had previously been agreed that ratification would continue unless the treaty had been rejected by at least five of the 25 [[Member state of the European Union|European Union member state]]s who must all ratify it. In an address to the [[European Parliament]], Blair stated: "I believe in Europe as a political project. I believe in Europe with a strong and caring social dimension."<ref>{{cite news | first =David | last = Rennie

Jacques Chirac held several meetings with Schröder <ref>{{Cite news|date=2005-06-04|title=Chirac and Schroeder discuss EU|language=en-GB|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4609053.stm|access-date=2020-06-30}}</ref> and the pair pressed for the UK to give up the [[UK rebate|rebate]] won by [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1984. After verbal conflict over several weeks, Blair, along with the leaders of all 25 EU member states, descended on [[Brussels]] for the EU Summit of 18 June 2005 to attempt to finalise the EU budget for 2007–13. Blair refused to renegotiate the rebate unless the proposals included a compensating overhaul of EU spending, particularly on the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] which composes 44% of the EU budget. The CAP stayed as it was agreed upon in 2002 and no decision about the budget was reached under the [[Luxembourg]] presidency.

Now it fell to Blair to broker a deal on the EU budget during the UK's [[Presidency of the European Union]] during the latter half of 2005. Early international opinion, particularly in the French press, suggested that Blair held a strong opening position partly on account of the concurrence of British presidencies of the EU and [[G8]]. However, early in the UK's six-month term; the [[7 July 2005]] London bombings distracted political attention from the EU despite some ambitious early statements about Blair's agenda.<ref>{{cite news| title = Blair urges debate on EU's future| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4639683.stm | work = BBC News | date = 1 July 2005|accessdate = 18 November 2006}}</ref> Domestically, Blair faced further distractions from European affairs including a resurgent [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under its newly elected leader [[David Cameron]], and assessments of the British presidency's achievements under Blair have been<ref>{{cite news | first = Paul | last= Reynolds| title = UK's EU reign marked by compromise| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4540166.stm | work = BBC News | date = 19 December 2005 | accessdate = 18 November 2006}}</ref> lukewarm in spite of some diplomatic success including a last-minute budget deal.

===London to host the 2012 Summer Olympics===
{{Further|Bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics}}
On 6 July 2005, during the 117th [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) session in Singapore, the IOC announced that the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the Games of the XXX Olympiad, were awarded to London over Paris by only four votes. The competition between Paris and London to host the Games had become increasingly heated particularly after French President [[Jacques Chirac]] commented three days before the vote that "one cannot trust people [ie: the British] whose cuisine are so bad."<ref>{{cite news | title = Chirac jokes about British food| url = http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4649007.stm  | work = BBC News | date = 4 July 2005|accessdate = 18 November 2006}}</ref> The surprise win by London over the perceived frontrunner Paris was said to have been decided by the presence of Blair at the IOC session. Irish IOC member Patrick Hickey said, "This is down to Tony Blair. If he hadn't come here I'd say that six to eight votes would have been lost and London would not be sitting here today winners".<ref>{{cite news | first = Mihir  | last = Bose  | title = London takes gold | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/2362091/London-takes-gold.html  | work = The Daily Telegraph | date = 17 June 2005 | accessdate = 18 November 2006}}</ref>

===2005 London bombings===
{{Main|7 July 2005 London bombings}}
[[Image:G8 bombings response.jpg|thumb|right|Blair, flanked by G8 leaders, reads a statement on their behalf condemning the attacks in London.]]
On Thursday 7 July 2005, [[7 July 2005 London bombings|a series of four bomb explosions]] struck London's public transport system during the morning rush-hour. All four incidents were suicide bombings. Fifty-six people were killed and 700 people were injured. The incident was the deadliest single [[Terrorism|act of terrorism]] in the United Kingdom since the 1988 bombing of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] over [[Lockerbie, Scotland]] which killed 270 people and replaced the 1998 [[Omagh bombing]] (29 dead) as the second-most deadly [[List of terrorist incidents in Great Britain|terrorist attack on British soil]]. It was also the deadliest bombing in London since [[World War II]].

Blair made [[Wikisource:Comments on the 2005 London transport explosions|a statement]] about the day's bombings, saying that he believed it was "reasonably clear" that it was an act of terror, and that he hoped the people of Britain could demonstrate that their will to overcome the events is greater than the terrorists' wish to cause destruction. He also said that his determination to "defend" the British way of life outweighed "extremist determination" to destroy it {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}. On 13 July 2005, he told that international co-operation would be needed to "pull up this evil ideology by its roots".<ref name=guardian-05-07-14>{{cite news |first=Linda |last=Heard |title=Criticism of Israel Is not 'anti-Semitism' |date=14 July 2005 |accessdate=18 November 2006 |publisher=[[Arab News]] |url=http://www.arabnews.com/?page=7&section=0&article=75857&d=5&m=9&y=2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203034952/http://www.arabnews.com/?page=7 |archive-date=3 December 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>

On 21 July 2005, [[21 July 2005 London bombings|a second series of explosions]] were reported in London, two weeks and some hours after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]]. Four controlled explosions, of devices considerably less advanced than those of the previous attacks, were carried out at [[Shepherd's Bush Market tube station|Shepherd's Bush]], [[Warren Street tube station|Warren Street]] and [[Oval tube station|Oval]] underground stations, and on a bus in [[Shoreditch]]. Even though the attacks on 21 July were less severe than those two weeks earlier, Blair was reported to have said that the bombings in London today were intended "to scare people and to frighten them, to make them anxious and worried". He went on to say how the "police have done their very best, and the [[MI5|security services]] too, in the situation, and I think we have just got to react calmly and continue with our business as much as possible normal".

Concerns about terror attacks led to 10 Downing Street requesting media organisations not to identify the location of Blair's 2005 summer holiday. After Blair attended a public function it was acknowledged that the holiday was in [[Barbados]], as a guest of the singer [[Cliff Richard]] with whom Blair had stayed with before. During a renewed stay there in August 2006, Blair refused to endorse calls for a ceasefire in [[Lebanon]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2006-09-03|title=Blair: The clock is ticking for a 'deluded' and 'self-indulgent' PM|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/blair-the-clock-is-ticking-for-a-deluded-and-self-indulgent-pm-clinging-on-to-power-6231848.html|access-date=2020-06-30|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref>

A ''Guardian''/ICM poll conducted after the first wave of attacks found that 64% of the British population believed that Blair's decision to wage war in Iraq had led indirectly to the terrorist attacks on London.<ref>{{cite news | title = The Iraq connection | url = https://www.theguardian.com/attackonlondon/comment/story/0,,1531902,00.html | work = The Guardian
 | publisher = Guardian Newspapers Ltd. | date = 20 June 2005 | accessdate = 18 November 2006 | location=London}}</ref> The public did however indicate approval of Blair's handling of the attacks, with his [[approval rating]] moving into positive territory for the first time in five years.<ref>{{cite news | first = Anthony | last = King| title = Britons will never give in to terrorists

[[Terrorism Act 2005|Proposed laws]] to cope with the threat of terrorism proved extremely controversial; an amendment to require that glorifying terrorism be deliberate to be an offence was rejected in the House of Commons by just three votes (a result initially announced as a one-vote margin, due to a miscount). The proposal to allow terrorist suspects to be held for questioning for up to 90 days was defeated on 9 November by a margin of 31<ref>{{cite news | title = Blair defeated over terror laws | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4422086.stm | work = BBC News | date = 9 November 2005|accessdate = 18 November 2006}}</ref> with 49 Labour MPs voting against the government. Instead, MPs supported an amendment to allow questioning for 28 days proposed by veteran backbencher [[David Winnick]]. This was Blair's first defeat on the floor of the House of Commons since he became Prime Minister in 1997, and most commentators saw this as seriously undermining his authority.<ref>{{cite news | title = Q&A: Blair's terror bill defeat | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4421726.stm | work = BBC News | date = 9 November 2005 | accessdate = 18 November 2006}}</ref>

===Education reforms, 2006===
The introduction of further reforms to the education system, which restricted the involvement of [[Local education authority|local education authorities]] in opening new schools, proved controversial. Labour backbenchers opposed to the proposals produced a rival manifesto, and the Bill to introduce the changes was delayed while the government negotiated with them. The Conservative Party declared its support for the reforms, making passage certain but increasing the likelihood that Labour MPs would vote against them. On 15 March 2006, the Education and Inspections Bill passed its second reading, with 52 Labour MPs voting against; had the Conservative Party also voted against it would have been defeated.<ref>Diane Reay, "Tony Blair, the promotion of the ‘active’educational citizen, and middle‐class hegemony."

===Local elections on 4 May 2006 and cabinet reshuffle===
{{Main|2006 United Kingdom local elections|2006 British cabinet reshuffle}}
The local elections in England on 4 May 2006 dealt a blow to Blair, with the loss of 317 seats and 18 councils. This result was thought to be partly continued fallout from public dissatisfaction over the decision to invade Iraq, and partly due to a scandal concerning the Home Office's mishandling of the deportation of foreign criminals. At the same time, an affair of Deputy Prime Minister [[John Prescott]] with his diary secretary had been made public. Further, some [[Primary care]] and Hospital Trust sustained significant deficits and had to release staff, which called into question the position of Health Secretary [[Patricia Hewitt]]. On 5 May, Blair reshuffled his Cabinet. Most significantly, Home Secretary [[Charles Clarke]] and Foreign Secretary [[Jack Straw]] were relieved of their duties and many other positions were reassigned.

===Darfur===
Blair urged EU member states on 20 October 2006 to send a strong message to the Sudanese government that it must allow a UN force into [[Darfur]], arguing that it is a critical time for [[Darfur]] and therefore a chance for the EU to strengthen the pressure on the Sudanese government.<ref>{{cite news | title = Genocide survivors urges EU sanctions over Darfur | url = http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L20607027.htm |agency = [[Reuters]] | date = 20 October 2006 | accessdate = 18 November 2006}}</ref>

===Debate over Muslim women wearing veils===
A debate over Muslim women wearing veils developed after Leader of the House of Commons Jack Straw said he asked women in his constituency to remove them when they visited him. Blair believed that this was a "mark of separation" and made some "outside the community feel uncomfortable". He also backed [[Kirklees]] Council, which suspended a classroom assistant [[Aishah Azmi]] for refusing to remove her full-face veil at school.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ian |last=Morgan |title=Immigration staff can ask Muslim women to remove veils |url=http://www.24dash.com/news/57/12221/index.htm |publisher=24dash.com |date=26 October 2006 |accessdate=21 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234444/http://www.24dash.com/news/57/12221/index.htm |archive-date=26 September 2007 }}</ref>

===Cash for Honours===

Blair was interviewed in connection with the "Cash for Honours" investigation by the police in December 2006, the first time that a serving Prime Minister has been questioned by police regarding a criminal investigation.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6179911.stm Blair questioned in honours probe], BBC, 14 December 2006</ref> He was interviewed for a second time on 26 January 2007 after the arrest of Downing Street official [[Ruth Turner (political advisor)|Ruth Turner]].

===Resignation as Labour Party leader and Prime Minister===
{{Main| 2007 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|l1=Labour Party leadership election, 2007}}
After the 2004 Labour Party conference, on 30 September 2004, Blair announced in a BBC interview<ref>{{cite video | people = Marr, Andrew (interviewer) |year =2004 | title = BBC Interview | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/news_web/video/40131000/bb/40131028_bb_16x9.ram | medium = Television| location = London | publisher = BBC News}}</ref> that he would serve a "full third term" but would not contest a fourth general election. No [[term limit]]s existed in British politics at that time, and such an announcement was historically unprecedented. Blair said he would give "ample time" for his successor to establish himself before the next general election, likely to be held in 2009 or 2010.

Following the 2005 general election, in which Labour was re-elected but with a significantly reduced majority; there was constant speculation over the date of Blair's departure from office. At Westminster, he was expected to retire after the proposed UK referendum on a European Union Constitution, but the constitution being thwarted at referendum in other countries negated any need for one in the UK (such a major issue as a union-wide constitution would require unanimity amongst the EU's member states). The 7/7 terror attacks also reduced the likelihood of an early departure. Speculation as to the likely timing of Blair's departure increased in May 2006, following Labour's poor results at the English local elections.

It was reported on 30 July 2006 that Blair had agreed to a £4,000,000 deal, in exchange his personal diaries, with a publishing firm owned by [[Rupert Murdoch]].<ref>{{cite news | first = Francis | last = Elliott | title = Tony & Cherie's American Dream | url = http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article1204504.ece | work = The Independent | date = 30 June 2006 | accessdate = 21 November 2006 | location = London | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060805200347/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article1204504.ece | archive-date = 5 August 2006 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

On 5 September 2006, a letter signed by 17 Labour MPs called for [[Tony Blair]] to resign. On the same day, 49 other Labour MPs signed a statement supporting Blair's departure timetable.<ref>{{cite news | title = Minister joins Blair exit demands | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5314632.stm | work = BBC News | date = 5 September 2006|accessdate = 18 November 2006}}</ref> The next day ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' reported that Blair would step down as Leader of the Labour Party on 31 May 2007, and as Prime Minister when a new leader is elected. That same day, seven of the MPs who signed the letter resigned as Parliamentary Private Secretaries (unpaid and unofficial posts assisting Government ministers).

On 7 September 2006, Blair announced that the 2006 Labour Party conference would be his last as leader (in other words, he planned to resign by September 2007). He did not announce a specific timetable for either his departure or the election of a new leader, but he did state that he would "set a precise date" at some point in the future. On 26 September 2006, he restated this at Labour's annual conference "this is my last conference as leader".<ref>{{cite news | title = In full: Tony Blair's speech | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5382590.stm | work = BBC News | date = 26 October 2006 | accessdate = 18 November 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Patrick | last = Wintour | title = Going, going, not quite gone | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labourconference2006/story/0,,1881797,00.html | work = The Guardian | publisher = Guardian Newspapers Ltd.  | date = 27 September 2006 | accessdate = 20 November 2006 | location=London}}</ref>

His successor was widely expected to be [[Gordon Brown]], the-then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], who launched his leadership bid on 11 May 2007. The only other politician to formally declare himself a contender for the Labour leadership following Blair's departure was the [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] Labour MP [[John McDonnell]], who launched his campaign on 14 July 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.john4leader.org.uk |title=John McDonnell MP.

On 2 May 2007, on the tenth anniversary of the 1997 general election, [[Tony Blair]] announced that he would be stepping down as Prime Minister in a matter of weeks. He further encouraged [[Gordon Brown]] as his successor as Leader of the Labour Party. On 3 May, it was further clarified by [[Downing Street]] that the exact date of resignation would be announced on 10 May. The following election of a new leader of the Labour Party was expected to take 48 days.

On 10 May 2007, Blair held a Cabinet meeting where he told his ministers about his resignation plans and later making a speech at the Trimdon Labour Club in his [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]] constituency before announcing at a press conference that he would step down as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 and that he would be asking the NEC to begin seeking a successor as Labour leader immediately. His deputy, [[John Prescott]], announced that he was also stepping down as Deputy Prime Minister later in the day at his local meeting in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]]. Blair began a world tour with a visit to [[Paris]] on 11 May 2007 to visit newly-elected French president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. His last two major events were the [[33rd G8 summit]] in [[Heiligendamm]] and the [[European Council]] summit from 21–22 June 2007.<ref>{{cite news | title = Blair makes his exit where it all began | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/the_blair_years/article1771045.ece | work = The Times | date = 10 May 2007 | location=London | first1=Philippe | last1=Naughton | first2=Sam | last2=Coates | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref>

[[Gordon Brown]] was duly elected Labour leader as the only successfully nominated candidate with 313 nominations compared to [[John McDonnell]]'s 29 at close of nominations on 17 May 2007, the result being declared formally and coming into effect on 24 June 2007 with [[Tony Blair]] resigning as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 and [[Gordon Brown]] being asked to form a government by The Queen later that day.<ref>{{cite news| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6457597.stm | title =Labour leader election timetable | date =9 May 2007 | work =BBC News }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.org.uk/leadership/nominations_close_-_1230_thursday_17_may |title=Labour leadership, close of nominations |date=17 May 2007 |work=[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] website |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921050327/http://www.labour.org.uk/leadership/nominations_close_-_1230_thursday_17_may |archive-date=21 September 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>

== "Presidential" Premiership ==

=== Presidential Nature ===
[[Tony Blair]]'s premiership has been termed as ‘[[Powers of the prime minister of the United Kingdom#Presidentialisation thesis|presidential]]’ by various political commentators and authors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The British Presidency: Tony Blair and the Politics of Public Leadership|last=Foley|first=Michael|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2000|location=Manchester}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Presidentialization of Politics|url=https://archive.org/details/presidentializat00pogu|url-access=limited|last1=Poguntke|first1=Thomas|last2=Webb|first2=Paul|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|location=Oxford|pages=[https://archive.org/details/presidentializat00pogu/page/n42 26]–62}}</ref> In 1997, [[Dan Balz]] of [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post'']] narrated his take on Blair's leadership:

"[[Tony Blair]] has adopted many persons as Britain’s leader: political reformer, griever in chief, general host of Friday night town meetings, relentless enforcer of a disciplined message. Both as a candidate and as Prime Minister, Blair has embraced a presidential style of leadership geared for the age of television and the era of declining faith of political parties".<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=The British Presidency: Tony Blair and the Politics of Public Leadership|last=Foley|first=Michael|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2000|location=Manchester|pages=6}}</ref>

[[Tony Blair]]'s presidential style of leadership was also the subject of study of [[Michael Foley (academic)|Michael Foley's]] book ''The British Presidency: [[Tony Blair]] and the Politics of Public Leadership''. Foley uses Blair's premiership as a case study to further the ‘presidentialisation thesis’, which is a model used to study the growing [[Powers of the prime minister of the United Kingdom|power of the British Prime Minister]] at the behest of the Cabinet, and the Parliament. According to Foley, centralisation of power under Blair, and his broader conduct in office points to the cementing of presidential tendencies in British politics.<ref name=":1" /> He writes:

“The British Prime Minister has evolved, and is evolving away from what a Prime Minister used to do and used to be… Blair’s premiership represents another part of the clinching proof that British politics has accommodated and adjusted to a distinctive presidential dimension”.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The British Presidency: Tony Blair and the Politics of Public Leadership|last=Foley|first=Michael|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2000|location=Manchester|pages=353}}</ref>

Thomas Poguntke and Paul Webb also studied the presidentialisation of the British government, and have mentioned the various aspects of Blair's premiership, that as whole, point to his presidential nature. These included:

*        [[Tony Blair]]'s heavy reliance on the [[10 Downing Street|Prime Minister's Office]] for decision making rather than the Cabinet.<ref name=":0" />
*        His step of strengthening the executive office at [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Whitehall]].<ref name=":0" />
*        Extensive changes were made to the Prime Minister's Office, which also included the appointment of a Chief of Staff.<ref name=":0" />
*        The size of the Prime Minister Office increased from 110 to 150 by the end of Blair's first term as premier. Special advisors assisting Blair increased from 8 (during [[John Major|John Major's]] term) to 25.<ref name=":0" />

Collectively, Blair's premiership has been informally referred to by many academics and political opponents as a "sofa government", as Blair was reliant on his advisors and close colleagues for decision making, rather than the Cabinet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1479929/Mandarins-attack-Blair-for-informal-sofa-government.html|title=Mandarins attack Blair for informal 'sofa' government|last=Helm|first=Toby|date=December 2004|website=The Telegraph|access-date=6 December 2018}}</ref> This depiction of Blair has been endorsed by various of Blair's own party member and ministers, including, [[Graham Allen (politician)|Graham Allen]], [[Mo Mowlam]] and [[Clare Short|Claire Short]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Last Prime Minister: Being Honest About the UK Presidency|last=Allen|first=Graham|publisher=Imprint Academic|year=2001|location=Exeter}}</ref> The [[Butler Review]] of 2004 also criticised Blair's style of sofa government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/blairs-sofa-cabinet-the-verdict-6983054.html|title=Blair's Sofa Cabinet-The Verdict|last=Beattie|first=Jason|date=2004|website=The Evening Standard|access-date=6 December 2018}}</ref>

=== Blair Defended ===
Various authors and writers have criticised the application of the presidentialisation thesis on the premiership of [[Tony Blair]] and have instead defended Blair. They have termed the use of presidential analogies for Blair as an unfair comparison between two systems that are fundamentally different. According to Richard Heffernan, for example, British Prime Ministers, including Blair, have dispensed their duties in a [[Parliamentary sovereignty|parliamentary model]] of governance, which is essentially very different from presidential models, which are largely based on the principle of [[separation of powers]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Heffernan|first=Richard|date=2013|title=There's No Need for the '-ization': The Prime Minister is Merely Prime Ministerial|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=66|issue=3|pages=636–645|doi=10.1093/pa/gss058}}</ref> In this context, Blair had four [[List of Government defeats in the House of Commons (1945–present)|defeats in the Parliament]], including an amendment that would have allowed the conditional detention of terrorism suspects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/nov/09/uksecurity.terrorism|title=Blair Defeated on Terror Bill|date=2005|website=The Guardian|access-date=6 December 2018}}</ref>

Political commentators have also pointed to the constant tussle between the Chancellor [[Gordon Brown]] and [[Tony Blair]] as evidence that the Prime Minister was not all too powerful.<ref name=":2" /> This, according to them, demonstrates that the Cabinet was still an effective arena for political dialogue.<ref name=":2" />

==Chancellorship of Gordon Brown (1997–2007)==
[[Image:Gordon Brown IMF.jpg|thumb|Gordon Brown speaking at the annual [[World Bank]]/[[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] meeting in 2002]]
[[Gordon Brown]] served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] of the [[United Kingdom]] from the Labour Party's 1997 general election victory on 2 May 1997 to 27 June 2007, when elevated as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. It was the second-longest continuous period of office of any Chancellor, surpassed only by [[Nicholas Vansittart, 1st Baron Bexley|Nicholas Vansittart]] two centuries before. Brown's time as Chancellor was marked by major reform of Britain's monetary and fiscal policy architecture, by a wide extension of the powers of the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] to cover much domestic policy, and by largely benign economic conditions.

===Records===
Brown's ten years and two months as Chancellor of the Exchequer set several records. He was the longest-serving Labour Party Chancellor of the Exchequer ever, beating [[Denis Healey]], who was Chancellor for 5 years and 2 months from 5 March 1974 to 4 May 1979. On 15 June 2004, he became the longest continuous serving Chancellor since the [[Reform Act 1832]], passing the figure of 7 years and 43 days set by [[David Lloyd George]] (1908–1915). However, [[William Ewart Gladstone]] was Chancellor for a total of 12 years and 4 months in the period from 1852 to 1882 (although not continuously). Brown stated his chancellorship had seen the longest period of sustained economic growth in [[History of the United Kingdom|UK history]],<ref>[http://www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/CP/Our_Society_Today/News_Articles_2005/economy.aspx?ComponentId=8723&SourcePageId=11412 "Budgeting for stable economic growth"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528071333/http://www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/CP/Our_Society_Today/News_Articles_2005/economy.aspx?ComponentId=8723&SourcePageId=11412 |date=28 May 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/publicfinances/story/0,,1439789,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=His record – 304 years and counting | first=Julian | last=Glover | date=17 March 2005 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> although part of this growth period started under the preceding [[Second Major ministry|Conservative government]] in 1993, and the details in Brown's growth figures have been challenged,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://money.independent.co.uk/personal_finance/tax/article6625.ece | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Sleight of hand fails to hide gaping holes in public purse | first=Philip | last=Thornton | date=17 March 2005 | accessdate=28 April 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012152121/http://money.independent.co.uk/personal_finance/tax/article6625.ece | archive-date=12 October 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/issues/4423887.stm | work=BBC News | title=Election fact check: Economic growth | date=8 April 2005 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> as have his more general claims to have created the conditions for prosperity and declining poverty levels.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Major acts as Chancellor===

====Bank of England====
On taking office as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], Brown gave the [[Bank of England]] operational independence in [[monetary policy]], and thus responsibility for setting [[interest rate]]s. At the same time, he stripped the Bank of England of its regulatory powers, giving them to the newly created [[Financial Services Authority]], whose board is appointed by the Treasury.

====Taxation and spending====
Brown adhered to Labour's 1997 election manifesto pledge not to increase the basic or higher rates of [[income tax]]. He reduced the starting rate from 20% (pre-1997) to 10% in 1999, before abolishing the starting rate in 2007; a decision that led to an immense backbench revolt, and reduced the basic rate from 23% (pre-1997) to 22% (2000) and then 20% (2007).<ref name=AdamBrowne>Figures from [https://www.ifs.org.uk/bns/bn09.pdf A survey of the UK tax system] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319151153/https://www.ifs.org.uk/bns/bn09.pdf |date=19 March 2016 }} Adam, S. and J. Browne, [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], [[Briefing note]] No. 9, March 2006</ref>

Brown increased the tax thresholds in line with inflation, rather than earnings, which rise more quickly during periods of economic growth. This results in [[fiscal drag]] in which more taxpayers are drawn into the upper rates (e.g. in 2000–01 there were 2,880,000 higher-rate taxpayers, whereas in 2005–06 there were 3,160,000).<ref name=AdamBrowne/>

In 1997, Brown also introduced taxation of pension funds. Documents subsequently released under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] showed that civil servants warned at the time that the move, which generated £5,000,000,000 in tax revenue, could lead to the closure of many occupational schemes, which subsequently came to pass. In 2008, a biographer of Brown, [[Tom Bower]], claimed that Brown had originally sought a larger sum from pension funds, but backed down in the face of opposition.<ref>[http://metro.co.uk/2009/10/26/browns-tax-raid-on-pensions-258676 Brown's tax raid on pensions The Metro 26 Oct 2009]</ref>

In contrast, [[Corporate tax|corporation tax]] fell under Brown, from a main rate of 33% (pre-1997) to 30% (1999) and then 28% (2007), and from 24% to 19% for [[small business]]es (although the lower rate was set to rise to 22% by 2010).<ref name=AdamBrowne/>

Under Brown, [[Telecommunications service provider|telecom]] [[radio frequency]] [[auction]]s gathered £22,500,000,000 for the government. By using a system of sealed bids and only selling a restricted number of licences, they extracted high prices from the telecom operators.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dial-a-fortune |url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,178157,00.html |work=[[guardian.co.uk]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=13 April 2000 |accessdate=29 February 2008 }}</ref> [[Germany]] at this time applied a similar auction; some allege that these together caused a severe [[recession]] in the European telecoms development industry (2001 [[Telecoms crash]]) with the loss of 100,000 jobs across Europe, 30,000 of those in the UK.<ref>Spectrum pricings uncertain future, Electronics World, Vol 108. September pp.24–25</ref> But, as [[Paul Klemperer]], one of the designers of the auctions, points out, "[t]he United States held no 3G auctions, yet telecoms companies lost just as much: in fact, they lost more."<ref name=klemperer>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuff.ox.ac.uk/users/klemperer/VirtualBook/19_Chapter8.pdf |pages=209 |title=Were Auctions a Good Idea? |accessdate=26 November 2008 |last=Klemperer |first=Paul |year=2004 |work=Auctions: Theory and Practice |publisher=Princeton University Press}}</ref>

Once the two-year period of following the Conservative's spending plans was over, Brown's 2000 Spending Review outlined a major expansion of [[government spending]], particularly on healthcare and education. In his April 2002 budget, Brown raised [[National Insurance]] to pay for increased health spending. Brown has changed [[tax policy]] in other ways, such as the introduction of [[working tax credit]]s. This is one of several ideas borrowed from the US [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration whereby welfare payments are accounted for as negative taxation. The separate [[Means test|means-testing]] process for [[tax credit]]s has been criticised by some as bureaucratic, and in 2003–04 and 2004–05 problems in the system led to overpayments of £2,200,000,000 and £1,800,000,000 respectively.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5032170.stm More get tax credit overpayments] [[BBC News]], 31 May 2006</ref> However, [[Economics|economic theory]] suggests tax credits can strengthen work incentives for those at the margin between employment and unemployment, and the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies|IFS]] has estimated the reforms brought at least 50,000 [[Single parent|single mothers]] into part-time work.<ref>[http://www.ifs.org.uk/bns/bn52.pdf#search=%22working%20tax%20credit%2016%20hours%22 The impact of tax and benefit changes between April 2000 and April 2003 on parents' labour supply] Blundell, R., M. Brewer and A. Shepherd, [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], Briefing Note No. 52, 2004</ref>

The [[Centre for Policy Studies]] found the poorest fifth of households, which accounted for 6.8% of all taxes in 1996-7, accounted for 6.9% of all taxes paid in 2004-5. Meanwhile, their share of state benefit payouts dropped from 28.1% to 27.1% over the same period.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2340541,00.html Poor lose out in Brown's tax reforms], ''The Times'' 3 September 2006.</ref>

According to the [[OECD]] UK taxation had increased from a 39.3% share of GDP in 1997 to 42.4% in 2006, going to a higher level than Germany.<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/5/51/2483816.xls General Government Outlays as percentage of GDP] [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]</ref> This increase has mainly been attributed to active government policy, and not simply to the growing economy. To have brought this about with only one explicit tax rise has led to accusations of Brown imposing [[stealth tax]]es. A commonly reported example resulted in 1997 from a technical change in the way corporation tax is collected, the indirect effect of which was for the [[dividend]]s on [[Stock|equity]] investments held within pensions to be taxed, thus lowering pension returns and allegedly contributing to the demise of some pension funds.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/10/15/nbrown15.xml Brown's raid on pensions costs Britain £100 billion], ''The Daily Telegraph'' 16 October 2006.</ref> The Treasury contend that this tax change was crucial to long-term economic growth: the existing corporation tax system created biased incentives for corporations to pay out profits as [[dividend]]s to shareholders (including pension funds, who could then reclaim the tax paid) rather than to reinvest them into company growth (which would result in corporation tax being paid). The old system of corporation tax was widely viewed by economists as a constraint on British economic growth.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/evandavis/2007/04/that_pensions_raid.html That pensions raid], [[Evan Davis (journalist)|Evan Davis]] 2 April 2007.</ref>

====Growth development and employment====
Brown pointed to two main accomplishments: growth and employment. An OECD report<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/document/61/0,2340,en_2649_201185_2483901_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Economic Outlook No. 78 Annex Tables — Table of Contents]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703163420/http://www.oecd.org/document/61/0%2C2340%2Cen_2649_201185_2483901_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |date=3 July 2007 }} [[OECD]]</ref> shows UK economic growth averaged 2.7% between 1997-2006, higher than the Eurozone's 2.1%, though lower than in any other [[English language|English-speaking]] country. UK unemployment is 5.5%,<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=12 National Statistics Unemployment rate]</ref> down from 7% in 1997 and lower than the Eurozone's average of 8.1%.

In October 1997, Brown took control of the United Kingdom's membership of the European single currency issue by announcing the Treasury would set five economic tests<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/EMU/Story/0,2763,375315,00.html The five tests] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 29 September 2000</ref> to ascertain whether the economic case had been made.

Brown believes it is appropriate to remove much of the unpayable [[Third World debt]] but does not think all debt should be wiped out.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/369846.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gordon Brown answers your questions | date=15 June 1999 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>

When Labour was re-elected for a third consecutive term at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] (though with a vastly reduced majority following the landslide victories at the previous two elections), many [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] spoke of the Labour election victory as being Brown's achievement rather than Blair's; while Blair was facing criticism as Prime Minister for leading the UK into needless wars in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]], Brown was receiving credit for helping secure a strong economy for Britain.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7593554.stm | work=BBC News | title=Who has been UK's greatest post-war PM? | date=16 September 2008}}</ref>

On 20 April 2006, in a speech to the United Nations Ambassadors, Brown outlined a "[[Green politics|Green]]" view of global development: {{quote|… far from being at odds with each other, our economic objectives and our environmental objectives now increasingly reinforce each other. … Environmental [[sustainability]] is not an option – it is a necessity. For economies to flourish, for [[Poverty|global poverty]] to be banished, for the [[Quality of life|well-being]] of the world's people to be enhanced – not just in this generation but in succeeding generations – we have a compelling and ever more urgent duty of stewardship to take care of the natural environment and resources on which our economic activity and social fabric depends. … A new paradigm that sees economic growth, [[social justice]] and environmental care advancing together can become the [[common sense]] of our age.<ref>[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/newsroom_and_speeches/press/2006/press_31_06.cfm Speech by Gordon Brown, New York, 20 April 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611031434/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/newsroom_and_speeches/press/2006/press_31_06.cfm |date=11 June 2007 }}</ref>}}

===Other statements and events===

====Higher education====
In 2000, Brown started a major political row about higher education (referred to as the [[Laura Spence Affair]]) when he accused the [[University of Oxford]] of [[elitism]] in its admissions procedures.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/759114.stm| title = Oxford 'reject' wins Harvard scholarship| accessdate = 30 March 2007| date = 22 May 2000| work = BBC News| publisher = [[BBC]]}}</ref> He described the University's decision not to offer a place to [[state school]] pupil Laura Spence as "absolutely outrageous" and implied its decision was based on her background rather than her academic potential. This started a major and hotly argued row in the media in which Oxford strongly denied these accusations. With his comments, Brown can arguably be credited with raising [[widening participation]] to higher education up the [[political agenda]]. However, many of his opponents said Brown's comments were ill-founded; including [[Roy Jenkins|Lord Jenkins]] (then [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the University of Oxford) who said "nearly every fact he used was false," and that Brown's speech had been a "little Blitzkrieg in being an act of sudden unprovoked aggression".<ref>{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/792021.stm| title = Peers condemn Oxford attack| accessdate = 30 March 2007| date = 15 June 2000| work = BBC News| publisher = [[BBC]]}}</ref>
