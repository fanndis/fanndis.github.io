'''Northern California''' (colloquially known as '''NorCal'''; {{lang-es|Norte de California}}) is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises the northern portion of the U.S. state of [[California]].

Northern California also contains [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] forests, along with the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], including [[Yosemite Valley]] and part of [[Lake Tahoe]], [[Mount Shasta]] (the second-highest peak in the [[Cascade Range]] after [[Mount Rainier]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]), and most of the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], one of the world's most productive agricultural regions.

The 48-county definition is not used for the '''[[Northern California Megaregion]]''', one of the 11 [[megaregions of the United States]]. The megaregion's area is instead defined from Metropolitan Fresno north to Greater Sacramento, and from the Bay Area east across [[Nevada]] state line to encompass the entire [[Lake Tahoe]]-[[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] area.<ref name="spur.org">{{cite web|first1=Gabriel|last1=Metcalf|first2=Egon |last2=Terplan|url= http://www.spur.org/publications/library/article/mappingthenortherncaliforniamegaregion11012007|title= The northern California megaregion|date=November–December 2007|work=The Urbanist|publisher=[[San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association]]|accessdate= November 21, 2009 }}</ref>

==Description==
[[File:NorCal county map (labeled and colored).png|thumb|Map of northern California counties]]
[[File:Cal3 map.svg|thumb|upright|Map of the three Californias according to the [[Cal 3]] ballot proposal{{legend|#00aae7|Northern California}}{{legend|#00468b|California}}{{legend|#9ac6ea|Southern California}}]]
'''Northern California''' is not a formal geographic designation. California's north-south midway division is around [[37th parallel north|37°N]], which is near the level of San Francisco. Popularly, though, "Northern California" usually refers to the state's northernmost 48 counties. Because of California's large size and diverse geography, the state can be subdivided in other ways as well. For example, the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] is a region that is distinct both culturally and topographically from coastal California, though in northern versus southern California divisions, the [[Sacramento Valley]] and most of the [[San Joaquin Valley]] are usually placed in northern California. Some observers describe three partitions of California, with north and south sections separated by [[Central California]].

The state is often considered as having an additional division north of the urban areas of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] metropolitan areas. Extreme northern residents have felt under-represented in state government and in 1941 attempted to form a new state with southwestern Oregon to be called [[Jefferson (Pacific state)|Jefferson]], or more recently to introduce legislation to [[Partition and secession in California|split California into two or three states]]. The coastal area north of the Bay Area is referred to as the [[North Coast (California)|North Coast]], while the interior region north of Sacramento is referred by locals as the Northstate.<ref name="HCN2018">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hcn.org/issues/50.1/communities-rural-discontent-finds-a-home-in-the-state-of-jefferson |title=A separatist state of mind |last=Wiles |first=Tay |date=January 22, 2018 |website=High Country News |language=en-us |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617023048/https://www.hcn.org/issues/50.1/communities-rural-discontent-finds-a-home-in-the-state-of-jefferson |archive-date=June 17, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=August 23, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==Significance==
Since the events of the [[California Gold Rush]], Northern California has been a leader on the world's economic, scientific, and cultural stages. From the development of gold mining techniques and logging practices in the 19th century that were later adopted around the world, to the development of world-famous and online business models (such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Google]], [[Yahoo!]], and [[eBay]]), northern California has been at the forefront of new ways of doing business. In science, advances range from being [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|the first]] to isolate and name fourteen [[transuranic]] [[chemical element]]s, to breakthroughs in microchip technology. Cultural contributions include the works of [[Ansel Adams]], [[George Lucas]], and [[Clint Eastwood]], as well as [[beatniks]], the [[Summer of Love]], [[California wine|winemaking]], the cradle of the international environmental movement, and the open, casual workplace first popularized in the Silicon Valley [[dot-com boom]] and now widely in use around the world. Other examples of innovation across diverse fields range from [[Genentech]] (development and commercialization of genetic engineering) to [[CrossFit]] as a pioneer in extreme human fitness and training.
It is also home to one of the largest Air Force Bases on the West Coast, and the largest of California, [[Travis Air Force Base]].

==Cities==
Northern California's largest [[metropolitan area]] is the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] which consists of 9 counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties. The cities of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], and their many [[suburbs]]. Although not a part of the Bay Area, in recent years the Bay Area has drawn more commuters from as far as [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] cities such as [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[Turlock, California|Turlock]] and [[Modesto, California|Modesto]]. These cities in the central part of the Central Valley and Sierra Nevada foothills may be viewed as part of a single [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]].<ref name="spur.org"/> The 2010 U.S. Census showed that the Bay Area grew at a faster rate than the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]] while Greater Sacramento had the largest growth rate of any metropolitan area in California.

The state's larger inland cities are considered part of Northern California in cases when the state is divided into two parts. Key cities in the region which are not in major metropolitan areas include [[Eureka, California|Eureka]] on the far [[North Coast (California)|North Coast]], [[Redding, California|Redding]], at the northern end of the Central Valley, [[Chico, California|Chico]], and [[Yuba City]] in the mid-north of the Central Valley, as well as [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and [[Visalia, California|Visalia]] on the southern end. Though smaller in each case, with the notable exception of [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], than the larger cities of the general region, these smaller regional centers are often of historical and economic importance for their respective size, due to their locations, which are primarily rural or otherwise isolated.

==History==
===Prehistory to 1847===
Inhabited for millennia by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], from the [[Shasta (tribe)|Shasta]] tribe in the north, to the [[Miwok]]s in the central coast and Sierra Nevada, to the [[Yokut people|Yokuts]] of the southern Central Valley, northern California was among the most densely populated areas of pre-Columbian North America.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.californiaprehistory.com/tribmap.html | title=California Indian Tribes map | website=CaliforniaPrehistory.com | author=R.F. Heizer | year=1966 | accessdate=February 10, 2007}}</ref>

====European explorers====
The first European to explore the coast was [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]], sailing for the Spanish Crown; in 1542, Cabrillo's expedition sailed perhaps as far north as the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] in today's [[Oregon]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/cabr/juan.html | title=Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo: A Voyage of Discovery  | publisher=U.S. National Park Service | accessdate=February 10, 2007}}</ref> Beginning in 1565, the Spanish [[Manila galleon]]s crossed the Pacific Ocean from [[Mexico]] to the Spanish [[Philippines]], with silver and gemstones from Mexico. The Manila galleons returned across the northern Pacific, and reached North America usually off the coast of northern California, and then continued south with their Asian trade goods to Mexico.

In 1579, northern California was visited by the English explorer [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] who landed north of today's [[San Francisco]] and claimed the area for England. In 1602, the Spaniard [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]] explored California's coast as far north as [[Monterey Bay]], where he went ashore. Other Spanish explorers sailed along the coast of northern California for the next 150 years, but no settlements were established.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

====Spanish era====
The first European inhabitants were Spanish missionaries, who built [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] along the California coast. The mission at [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo|Monterey]] was first established in 1770, and at [[Mission San Francisco de Asís|San Francisco]] in 1776. In all, ten missions stretched along the coast from [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] to Monterey (and still more missions to the southern tip of [[Baja California]]). In 1786, the [[France|French]] signaled their interest in the northern California area by sending a voyage of exploration to Monterey.

The first twenty years of the 19th century continued the colonization of the northern California coast by Spain. By 1820, Spanish influence extended inland approximately 25 to {{convert|50|mi|km|0}} from the missions. Outside of this zone, perhaps 200,000 to 250,000 Native Americans continued to lead traditional lives. The [[Adams-Onís Treaty]], signed in 1819 between Spain and the young United States, set the northern boundary of the Spanish claims at the 42nd parallel, effectively creating today's northern boundary of northern California.

====Russian presence====
In 1812, the Russian state-sponsored [[Russian-American Company]] established [[Fort Ross]], a fur trading outpost on the coast of today's [[Sonoma County]]. Fort Ross was the southernmost Russian settlement, located some {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} north of Spanish colonies in San Francisco. In 1839, the settlement was abandoned due to its inability to meet resource demands, and the increasing Mexican and American presence in the region.<ref>https://www.fortross.org/russian-american-company.htm#The%20Russian%20Advance%20to%20California</ref>

====Mexican era====
After Mexico gained [[Mexican War of Independence|independence]] from Spain in 1821, Mexico continued Spain's missions and settlements in northern California as well as Spain's territorial claims. The Mexican ''[[Californio]]s'' (Spanish-speaking Californians) in these settlements primarily traded cattle hides and [[tallow]] with American and European merchant vessels.

[[File:Trees and sunshine.JPG|thumb|right|[[Sequoia sempervirens|Coast Redwoods]] in [[Muir Woods National Monument]], in [[Marin County]].]]
In 1825, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] established a major trading post [[Fort Vancouver|just north]] of today's [[Portland, Oregon]]. British fur trappers and hunters then used the [[Siskiyou Trail]] to travel throughout northern California.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://museumsiskiyoutrail.org/upper_soda_springs_information/hunters_and_trappers.html | title=Hunters and Trappers at Upper Soda Springs | publisher=Museum of the Siskiyou Trail | author= | date= | accessdate=February 10, 2007}}</ref> The leader of a further French scientific expedition to northern California, [[Eugene Duflot de Mofras]], wrote in 1840 "''...it is evident that California will belong to whatever nation chooses to send there a man-of-war and two hundred men''."<ref name="hhb1840">{{cite book |last=Bancroft |first=Hubert Howe |url=https://archive.org/details/nativeracespaci15bancgoog |year=1886 |title=History of California, 1840–1845, Volume 4 |publisher=A. L. Bancroft|authorlink= Hubert Howe Bancroft |oclc=9475460}}</ref>{{Rp|260}} By the 1830s, a significant number of non-''Californios'' had immigrated to northern California. Chief among these was [[John Sutter]], a European immigrant from [[Switzerland]], who was granted {{convert|48827|acre|km2}} [[Sutter's Fort|centered]] on the area of today's [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=485 | title=Sutter's Fort Historic State Park | publisher=California Department of Parks & Recreation | accessdate=February 10, 2007}}</ref>

====American interest====
American trappers began entering northern California in the 1830s.<ref name="hhb1840" />{{Rp|263–4}} In 1834, American visionary [[Ewing Young]] led a herd of horses and mules over the [[Siskiyou Trail]] from missions in northern California to British and American settlements in [[Oregon]]. Although a small number of American traders and trappers had lived in northern California since the early 1830s, the first organized overland party of American immigrants to arrive in northern California was the [[Bartleson-Bidwell Party]] of 1841 via the new [[California Trail]].<ref name="hhb1840" />{{Rp|263–273}} Also in 1841, an overland exploratory party of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] came down the [[Siskiyou Trail]] from the Pacific Northwest. In 1846, the [[Donner Party]] earned notoriety as they struggled to enter northern California.

====Californian independence and beginning of the United States era====
When the [[Mexican–American War]] was declared on May 13, 1846, it took almost two months (mid-July 1846) for word to get to California. On June 14, 1846, some 30 non-Mexican settlers, mostly Americans, staged a revolt and seized the small Mexican garrison in Sonoma. They raised the "[[Flag of California|Bear Flag]]" of the [[California Republic]] over Sonoma. The "Bear Flag Republic" lasted only 26 days, until the U.S. Army, led by [[John Frémont]], took over on July 9.<ref name=1846-54>{{cite web |url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=1096 |title=American Transition to Early Statehood |publisher=California Department of Parks & Recreation |accessdate=February 10, 2007}}</ref> The California state flag today is based on this original Bear Flag, and continues to contain the words "California Republic."

Commodore [[John Drake Sloat]] ordered his naval forces to occupy [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (present [[San Francisco]]) on July 7 and within days American forces controlled San Francisco, Sonoma, and [[Sutter's Fort]] in Sacramento.<ref name=1846-54/> The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|treaty]] ending the Mexican–American War was signed on February 2, 1848, and Mexico formally ceded [[Alta California]] (including all of present-day northern California) to the United States.

[[File:Moon Lake.jpg|thumb|right|Moon Lake in [[Lassen County, California]]. ]]

===Gold Rush and California statehood===
The [[California Gold Rush]] took place almost exclusively in northern California from 1848–1855. It began on January 24, 1848, when [[gold]] was discovered at [[Sutter's Mill]] in [[Coloma, California|Coloma]].<ref name = santos>"[E]vents from January 1848 through December 1855 [are] generally acknowledged as the 'Gold Rush' .... After 1855, California gold mining changed and is outside the 'rush' era." {{cite web | title = The Gold Rush of California: A Bibliography of Periodical Articles  | publisher = California State University, Stanislaus| year = 2002| url = http://library.csustan.edu/bsantos/goldrush/GoldTOC.htm | accessdate =  January 23, 2008}}</ref> News of the discovery soon spread, resulting in some 300,000&nbsp;people coming to California from the rest of the United States and abroad. [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] grew from a tiny hamlet, home to about 1,000 [[Californios]] into a [[boomtown]] of over 50,000 people in the 12 years between 1848 and 1860<ref>{{Cite book|last=Richards, Rand, 1949-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/23463043|title=Historic San Francisco : a concise history and guide|date=1991|publisher=Heritage House Publishers|isbn=1-879367-00-9|location=San Francisco|oclc=23463043}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Bureau|first=US Census|title=1860 Census: Population of the United States|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1864/dec/1860a.html|access-date=2020-10-10|website=The United States Census Bureau|language=EN-US}}</ref>. New roads, churches, and schools were built, and new towns sprung up, aided in part by the development of new methods of transportation such as [[steamship]]s which came into regular service and [[California and the railroads|railroads]] which now connected the coasts. The Gold Rush also had negative effects: [[California Genocide|American colonists chose to use genocide as a tool]] to remove the [[Indigenous peoples of California|Indigenous people]] so that they could look for gold on their land. [[Ostrea lurida|Native oyster species]] saw their numbers plummet when American colonists began over-harvesting them, leading to a near-extinction of the oysters from the California coast on up into the [[Pacific Northwest]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} and [[gold mining]] caused environmental harm{{Specify}}.

The Gold Rush also increased pressure to make California a [[U.S. state]]. Pro-slavery politicians initially attempted to permanently divide northern and southern California at 36 degrees, 30 minutes, the line of the [[Missouri Compromise]]. But instead, the passing of the [[Compromise of 1850]] enabled California to be admitted to the Union as a [[Slave and free states|free state]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===Population and agricultural expansion (1855–1899)===
[[File:Mount Shasta Farm.jpg|thumb|left|Farm near [[Mount Shasta]]]]
The decades following the Gold Rush brought dramatic expansion to northern California, both in population and economically&nbsp;– particularly in agriculture. The completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, with its terminus in Sacramento (and then later, Oakland), meant that northern California's agricultural produce (and some manufactured goods) could now be shipped economically to the rest of the United States. In return, immigrants from the rest of the United States (and Europe) could comfortably come to northern California. A network of railroads spread throughout northern California, and in 1887, a [[Siskiyou Trail|rail link]] was completed to the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Almost all of these railways came under the control of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], headquartered in San Francisco, and San Francisco continued as a financial and cultural center.

Substantial tensions during this era included nativist sentiments (primarily against Chinese immigrants){{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}, tensions between the increasing power of the Southern Pacific Railroad and small farmers, and the beginnings of the labor union movement.

==Economy==
Northern California's economy is noted for being the de facto world leader in high-tech industry ([[software]], [[semiconductor]]/micro-electronics, [[biotechnology]] and [[medical devices]]/instruments), as well as being known for [[Environmental engineering|clean power]], biomedical, government, and finance. Other significant industries include tourism, shipping, manufacturing, and agriculture. Its economy is diverse, though more concentrated in high technology, and subject to the whims of [[venture capital]] than any other major regional economy in the nation especially within [[Silicon Valley]], and less dependent on oil and residential housing than [[Southern California]].{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} It is home to the state capital, as well as several Western United States regional offices in San Francisco, such as the [[Federal Reserve]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Circuit Court]].

==Climate==
[[File:Northern California Köppen.png|thumb|upright|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] in northern California]]
Northern California has warm or mild to cold climate, in which the Sierra gets snow in the late fall through winter and occasionally into spring. Summers are mild along the coast and generally warm and dry, while winters are cool and usually wet. The high temperatures range from 50s to 30s in the winters while summers temperature range is 90s to 60s or 50s, with highs well into the 100s for the Sacramento region. Snow covers the mountains (generally above 3000 feet) in mid January through February. Fog occurs infrequently or occurs normally in the west and coast, especially in the summer, creating some of the coolest summer conditions in North America.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

The population of the forty-eight counties of northern California has shown a steady increase over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countingcalifornia.cdlib.org/sas-bin/broker?_program=prd.calmatx.sas&study=histpop&file=histcnty%20histcity%20histst&varMtx=histpop_1&dtbl=histpop_1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231155609/http://countingcalifornia.cdlib.org/sas-bin/broker?_program=prd.calmatx.sas&study=histpop&file=histcnty%20histcity%20histst&varMtx=histpop_1&dtbl=histpop_1|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 31, 2003|title=Historical census data by U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=February 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=U.S. Census website|first=U. S. Census|last=Bureau|website=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=February 6, 2019}}</ref> 

The largest percentage increase outside the Gold Rush era (51%) came during the 1940s, as the region was the destination of many post-War veterans and their families, attracted by the greatly expanding industrial base and (often) by their time stationed in northern California during [[World War II]]. The largest absolute increase occurred during the 1980s (over 2.1 million person increase), attracted by job opportunities in part by the expansion taking place in [[Silicon Valley]] and the [[Cold War]] era expansion of the defense industry. The 2010 U.S. Census revealed that northern California grew at a faster rate than Southern California in the 2000s with a rate slightly higher than the state average.

==Parks and other protected areas==
===National Park System===
{{Main|List of areas in the National Park System of the United States|List of National Parks of the United States}}
The U.S. [[National Park System]] controls a large and diverse group of parks in northern California. The best known is [[Yosemite National Park]], which is displayed on the reverse side of the [[:Image:California quarter, reverse side, 2005.jpg|California state quarter]]. Other prominent parks are the [[Kings Canyon National Park|Kings Canyon]]-[[Sequoia National Park]] complex, [[Redwood National Park]], [[Pinnacles National Park]], [[Lassen Volcanic National Park]] and the largest in the contiguous forty-eight states, [[Death Valley National Park]].

===National Monuments and other federally protected areas===
{{Main|List of National Monuments of the United States|United States National Marine Sanctuary|List of National Wildlife Refuges|List of U.S. National Forests}}
