'''The University of New Mexico School of Medicine''' (UNM School of Medicine) is a division of the [[University of New Mexico]] Health Sciences Center (UNM HSC) located in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. The UNM School of Medicine is home to a variety of degree-granting programs, including the only [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] program in the state.

== History ==
The school was established in 1961 by the Regents of the University of New Mexico. The first class was admitted in 1964, and the school graduated its first class in 1968. The school also received full accreditation by the [[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]] that same year. The school uses [[University of New Mexico Hospital|UNM Hospital]] as its primary teaching hospital, along with the VA Medical Center located at [[Kirtland Air Force Base]], along with the other hospitals that make up the [[UNM Hospitals]] system.

In 1994, University administration decided to combine the School of Medicine, along with other programs in Physical and Occupation Therapy, Biochemistry, Medical Laboratory Sciences, and other programs into one entity known as the UNM Health Sciences Center, with the aim of combining the education and research contributions of each of these entities into one. While they may be grouped together on paper, day-to-day operation of each department is somewhat independent of each other.

'''MD program admissions'''

Currently, the MD program enrolls about 106 new students each academic year, with the total enrollment in the MD program comprising about 15% of the School of Medicine student body.<ref>{{cite web |title=HSC Databook |url=https://hsc.unm.edu/_docs/databook/som-student-enrollment.pdf |accessdate=7 October 2020}}</ref> Because the school is supported with state money, primary admissions preference is given to [[New Mexico]] residents. Secondary preference is given to applicants from other Western states that do not have a medical school, such as Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana, as well as applicants from all other states. As is the case with virtually all other medical schools in the United States, admission is very competitive.

'''National recognition'''

The school is widely known for its Rural Medicine, Family Medicine and Primary Care Medicine programs. These programs are consistently ranked among the best nationally, with the Rural Medicine program consistently being ranked in the top five nationally. In 2015, ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' rated UNM 3rd in Rural Medicine, 10th in Family Medicine, and 35th in Primary Care.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-medical-schools/university-of-new-mexico-04068|title=Ratings|website=grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com|access-date=2019-06-25}}</ref>

Additionally, the state-of-the-art Domenici Center for Health Sciences Education at the school has received attention for both the Leonard M. Napolitano Ph.D. Anatomical Education Center (anatomy lab) and the Interprofessional Healthcare Simulation Center ([http://hslic.unm.edu/iHSC/index.html IHSC]). The anatomy lab was named in recognition of Leonard Napolitano, an anatomist and a founding member of the School of Medicine in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hslic.unm.edu/about-hslic/domenici/index.html|title=Domenici Center :: Health Sciences Library & Informatics Center - The University of New Mexico|website=hslic.unm.edu}}</ref> The IHSC is designed to simulate the provider experience using standardized patients and allows students to experience and practice clinical skills while not putting patients at risk. The IHSC is unique in that it houses four different simulations including Acute Care, In-Patient, Out-Patient, and Pharmacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hslic.unm.edu/iHSC/index.html|title=About the Interprofessional Healthcare Simulation Center (IHSC) :: Interprofessional Healthcare Simulation Center - The University of New Mexico|website=hslic.unm.edu}}</ref>
