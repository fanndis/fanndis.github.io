[[Donald Trump]]'s use of [[social media]] has attracted worldwide attention. He frequently uses [[Twitter]] and other [[social media]] platforms to make comments about other politicians, celebrities, private citizens and daily news. From his official declaration of candidacy in June 2015 through the first two-and-a-half years of his presidency, he tweeted over 17,000 times. Since early in his presidency, his tweets have been considered official statements by the [[president of the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/06/politics/trump-tweets-official-statements/index.html|title=Spicer: Tweets are Trump's official statements|author=Elizabeth Landers|date=June 6, 2017|publisher=CNN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720220333/http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/06/politics/trump-tweets-official-statements/index.html|archive-date=July 20, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Background==
{{Further|Social media and political communication in the United States|Social media in the United States presidential election, 2016}}
The emergence of [[social media]] has changed the way in which political communication takes place in the [[Politics of the United States|United States]]. Political institutions such as politicians, [[political parties]], foundations, institutions, and political [[think tank]]s are all using social media platforms, like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], to communicate with and engage voters. Regular individuals, politicians, "[[pundit]]s" and [[thought leader]]s alike are able to voice their opinions, engage with a wide network, and connect with other likeminded individuals.<ref name="Kearney2013">{{cite thesis |last=Kearney|first=Michael|date=2013|title=Political Discussion on Facebook: An Analysis of Interpersonal Goals and Disagreement|publisher= University of Kansas|hdl=1808/12975}}</ref> According to [[Wael Ghonim]], social media can reinforce pre-existing beliefs rather than promote new ones. Social media, while a great source of gathering volunteers and money, serves the main purpose of affirming political beliefs and strengthening a political base.<ref>{{Cite web

Politicians have the ability to raise large amounts of money in relatively short periods of time through social media campaigns. In 2012, President [[Barack Obama]] raised over a billion dollars for his campaign, which broke the fundraising record. Around $690 million was raised through online donations including social media, email, and website donations, and more money was raised from small donors than ever before.<ref name="auto">Scherer, Michael. “Exclusive: Obama’s 2012 Digital Fundraising Outperformed 2008.” Time.

The 2008 US presidential election was the first election in which candidates utilized the Internet and social media networking as a communicative tool incorporated into candidates' campaigns.<ref>Carr, David. “How Obama Tapped Into Social Networks’ Power.” New York Times.

[[File:Twitter activity of Donald Trump.png|thumb|right|Donald Trump's tweet activity from his first tweet in May 2009. His tweet activity pattern has changed from 2013.]]
From his [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|official declaration of candidacy]] in 2015, [[Donald Trump]] benefited from large numbers of supporters active on social media. Some supporters called themselves "Centipedes" online.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/opinion/sunday/reddit-and-the-god-emperor-of-the-internet.html|title=Opinion – Reddit and the God Emperor of the Internet|last=Lagorio-Chafkin|first=Christine|date=19 November 2016|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

By late 2019, President Trump had created a new style of communications to the public that largely bypassed the [[White House Press Secretary]] and relied on his own direct speaking and tweets. According to a report in ''[[Politico]]'':
:He prefers to issue major announcements himself over social media, whether policy moves or staff firings. He killed the daily White House briefing, preferring the messy practice of fielding reporters’ shouted questions from the Oval Office or before his presidential helicopter. As Year Three of his presidency closes out, Trump has built his style of communicating around the pillars of political grievances, conspiracy theories and targeting perceived enemies. Most of all, he prefers to dictate and dominate the news cycle.<ref>See [https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/11/trump-instincts-unimpeachable-presidency-ukraine-069015 Nancy Cook, "Trump’s bluster crashes into a barrage of impeachment facts: The president’s confident, solo style is set to collide with Democratic efforts to publicly expose his actions over Ukraine aid."

Trump's uses the retweet feature on Twitter to forward messages he agrees with, no matter how obscure their authors are. Praising Trump is "important" to secure a retweet from him, wrote ''The Washington Post''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bump |first1=Philip |title=Donald Trump's curious retweeting habits – in 25 retweets |url-access=subscription |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/29/the-25-most-popular-donald-trump-retweets-of-random-people/ |access-date=June 16, 2020 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 29, 2015 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200616145147/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/29/the-25-most-popular-donald-trump-retweets-of-random-people/ |archive-date=June 16, 2020}}</ref> At times, Trump retweets himself,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Crivelli |first1=Vincent |title=President Trump firing off tweets, hitting the links on Black Friday |url=https://cbs12.com/news/local/president-trump-firing-off-tweets-hitting-the-links-on-black-friday |access-date=June 16, 2020 |work=[[CBS12]] |date=November 24, 2018}}</ref> and sometimes he comments: "So true" while retweeting himself.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Chiu |first1=Allyson |title=Freed of briefing duty, wounded Trump airs full collection of grievances on Twitter, retweeting claim of "coup attempts" |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/04/27/trump-twitter-media-coronavirus/ |url-access=subscription |access-date=June 16, 2020 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200427230302/https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/04/27/trump-twitter-media-coronavirus/ |archive-date=April 27, 2020}}</ref>

After winning the election, Trump said in a November 12, 2016 television interview that, as president, his use of social media would be "very restrained, if I use it at all."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-donald-trump-family-melania-ivanka-lesley-stahl/|title=President-elect Trump speaks to a divided country|last=Stahl|first=Lesley|date=13 November 2016|website=CBS News|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> He did reduce his number of tweets during his early time in office, but he gradually increased his use of Twitter. By the first half of 2019, he was tweeting as frequently as he had done during his candidacy, and he doubled this rate during the second half of 2019 and the first half of 2020. His most prolific day was June 5, 2020, when he tweeted 200 times.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Perrett|first=Connor|date=6 June 2020|title=Trump broke his all-time tweeting record amid nationwide protests, sending more tweets in a single day than he did during his impeachment trial|url=https://www.insider.com/trump-breaks-record-most-tweets-in-a-single-day-2020-6|access-date=6 June 2020|website=Insider}}</ref>

In addition to the tweets he puts out, he is also the intended recipient of tweets by others. In 2019, Donald Trump was tagged on Twitter at a rate of 1,000 times per minute, according to ''The New York Times.''<ref name=":2" />

In 2017, the Department of Justice argued in one court case that Trump's tweets were "official statements of the President of the United States."<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|last=Journal|first=A. B.

In 2019, the Secretary of the U.S. Navy said he did not interpret a Trump tweet as a "a formal order to act" after Trump tweeted that the Navy should not take away Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher' status as a Navy Seal.<ref>{{Cite web|last=News|first=A.

In 2020, a court asked that Trump clarify his intention after he tweeted what appeared to be an order calling for the disclosure of documents related to Russian interference in the 2016 election. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows clarified that the tweet in question was not an official directive. Meadows said, "The President indicated to me that his statements on Twitter were not self-executing declassification orders and do not require the declassification or release of any particular documents."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gonzalez|first=Oriana|title=Mark Meadows confirms in court Trump's tweets "declassifying" Russia documents were false|url=https://www.axios.com/mark-meadows-trump-tweets-russia-25ac5379-c19a-4978-bdd7-ab9577fe800e.html|access-date=2020-11-11|website=Axios|language=en}}</ref>

===Timeline===

In 2009, marketing staffer Peter Costanzo suggested to Trump that he could use social media to draw attention to his book, ''[[Think Like a Champion]]'', which was due to be released later that year. He was unable to use the username @DonaldTrump, as it was already being used by a parody account. He and his marketing team decided to use the username '''@realDonaldTrump'''.<ref name="bbc-history"/> Trump joined Twitter in March 2009 and sent out his first tweet on May 4, 2009, advertising his upcoming appearance on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', which was due to air a couple of days later.<ref name="bbc-history"/>

From 2009 to 2011, tweets posted by the @realDonaldTrump account included the phrase "from Donald Trump" to distinguish them from those written by his staff, but by about June 2011, as Trump's use of the platform increased, those identifying labels disappeared.<ref name="bbc-history"/> During the 2016 campaign, some tweets were sent from an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phone, and others from an [[iPhone]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/story/tell-when-someone-else-tweets-from-realdonaldtrump |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |title=How To Tell When Someone Else Tweets From @realDonaldTrump |first=Ashley |last=Feinberg |date=October 6, 2017 |access-date=October 6, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006162932/https://www.wired.com/story/tell-when-someone-else-tweets-from-realdonaldtrump/ |archive-date=October 6, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="cnet-nasty"/> The Android tweets were more likely to be sent outside of business hours and to take a more combative tone. The iPhone tweets were suspected to be written and sent by members of Trump's staff, a suspicion that was largely confirmed using [[sentiment analysis]];<ref name="sciam-sentiment"/> [[machine learning]] and [[natural language processing]] could still frequently distinguish Trump's tweets from others sent in his name, even when staffers attempted to emulate his writing style.<ref name="atlantic-bot"/>

In 2012, following the victory of President Barack Obama in the US presidential election, Trump tweeted a chain of disparaging comments about Obama's win. Trump began that Election Day with a flurry of familiar complaints. He mocked Obama for playing basketball and blamed the Chinese for creating "the concept of global warming". Trump tweeted the next day, "but we'll have to live with it!" and: ''We have to make America great again!''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/donald-trump-rigged-vote-twitter-2012/index.html|title=Sound familiar?

From 2013 onwards, Trump's Twitter activity pattern significantly increased in the volume of his tweets and the rate of politically charged rhetoric, channeling the same bluntness that helped fuel his political rise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/politics/donald-trump-syria-twitter.html|title=Trump's View of Syria: How It Evolved, in 19 Tweets|first=Nicholas|last=Fandos|date=April 7, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4724135/donald-trump-tweets-retweets-didnt-age-well/|title=22 Tweets That Came Back to Haunt President Trump|website=Time}}</ref>

Twitter was an important political communication tool of [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump's presidential election campaign]] in 2016, and has been credited as contributing to his victory.<ref name="fortune-facebook"/> Former White House communications director [[Anthony Scaramucci]] recalled that Trump "felt that there was no separation between his brand and the media, that there was an intersection of value for himself personally between his brand and saturating it in the media".<ref name=Rogers16Apr>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|date=16 April 2019|access-date=17 April 2019 |first1=Katie|last1=Rogers|first2=Maggie|last2=Haberman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/politics/trump-news-mueller.html|title=This Just In!

In 2017, Trump was described as "possibly the first 'social media' and 'reality TV' president" in an article by [[Van Jones]] on [[CNN]]'s website in October 2017. Following Trump's inauguration, he gained control of the official U.S. presidential Twitter account (@POTUS), which had been created by the previous president, [[Barack Obama]]. Trump's first tweets as president were made from his personal account, but he has used both accounts.<ref name="cnet-inaug"/> After Joe Biden won the November 2020 presidential election, Twitter said it planned to hand over the @POTUS account to Biden upon his inauguration on January 20, 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=20 November 2020|title=Twitter Will Transfer POTUS Account to Biden in January|url=https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/twitter-potus-president-biden-trump-1234837310/|access-date=21 November 2020|website=Variety|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=20 November 2020|title=Twitter Will Transfer POTUS Account to Biden in January|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/twitter-transfer-potus-account-biden-061145012.html|access-date=21 November 2020|website=www.yahoo.com|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Live-tweeting ''Fox & Friends''===
Trump is a known viewer of the [[Fox News]] show ''[[Fox & Friends]]'' and has tweeted reactions to what he has seen on the show on numerous occasions. One well-known example is his tweet on January 2, 2018, when he stated that his "Nuclear Button" was "much bigger & more powerful" than [[Kim Jong Un]]'s, following a Fox News segment about Jong Un's "Nuclear Button" minutes before. Trump watches several hours of cable news shows each day, using the "Super [[TiVo]]" he had installed at the White House.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/us/politics/donald-trump-president.html|title=Inside Trump's Hour-by-Hour Battle for Self-Preservation|last1=Haberman|first1=Maggie|date=December 9, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 15, 2018|last2=Thrush|first2=Glenn|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=Baker|first3=Peter}}</ref> News organizations have compiled lists of Trump tweets directly repeating what he was watching. The result is that stories that Fox concentrates on become nationally important stories by virtue of the fact that they appear in presidential tweets, setting up a [[feedback loop]].<ref name="Studied">{{cite news|title=I've Studied the Trump-Fox Feedback Loop for Months.

===Insults===
In January 2016, a review by ''[[The New York Times]]'' found that one in every eight posts by Trump on Twitter "was a personal insult of some kind".<ref name="nyt-insults"/> {{As of|2019|01|df=US}}, Trump had insulted 551 people (including private citizens), places, and things on Twitter, ranging from politicians to journalists and news outlets to entire countries.<ref name="nyt-551"/> In 2015, Trump tweeted against an 18-year-old college student who had challenged him at a [[New Hampshire]] political forum led to a wave of [[online harassment]] against her.<ref name="wapo-private"/> In December 2016, then-president-elect Trump responded to criticism from the president of [[United Steelworkers]] Local 1999 in [[Indiana]] by tweeting that the [[local union]] leader "has done a terrible job representing workers";<ref name="wsj-union"/> the union president received threatening phone calls afterward.<ref name="wapo-union"/> Trump often gives opponents [[List of nicknames used by Donald Trump|nicknames]] such as [[Hillary Clinton|"Crooked Hillary"]]<ref name="Roll Call">{{cite news|last1=Bennett|first1=John T.|title=Top 10 Trump Nicknames and Why They Stick to His Foes|url=https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/power-rankings-top-10-trump-nicknames-stick-foes|website=[[Roll Call]]|date=August 2, 2018|access-date=February 19, 2019}}</ref> and [[Ted Cruz|"Lyin' Ted"]].<ref name="USA Today Estepa">{{cite web|last1=Estepa|first1=Jessica|title=It's not just 'Rocket Man.'

===Sharing of violent, far-right, and extremist content===
Trump has been criticized for his practice of retweeting or copying material from social media accounts posting antisemitic, racist, or false information, such as claims exaggerating the number of crimes committed by black people.<ref name="Diamond CNN">{{cite web|last1=Diamond|first1=Jeremy|title=Donald Trump's 'Star of David' tweet controversy, explained|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/04/politics/donald-trump-star-of-david-tweet-explained/index.html|website=CNN|access-date=September 21, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922003747/http://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/04/politics/donald-trump-star-of-david-tweet-explained/index.html|archive-date=September 22, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Politifact Star">{{cite web|title=Donald Trump's 'Star of David' tweet: a recap|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/05/donald-trumps-star-david-tweet-recap/|website=Politifact|access-date=September 21, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913141352/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jul/05/donald-trumps-star-david-tweet-recap/|archive-date=September 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Pearce LA Times Wrestling">{{cite web|last1=Pearce|first1=Matt|title=Once again, Trump tweets a meme linked to a brazen racist|url=https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-reddit-20170703-story.html|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=September 21, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704192615/http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-reddit-20170703-story.html|archive-date=July 4, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====During campaign====
[[PolitiFact]] singled out as particularly obviously false an image retweeted by Trump that claimed that 81% of white murder victims are killed by black people. Politifact noted that, besides being a five-fold exaggeration, the claim was sourced to the non-existent "Crime Statistics Bureau, San Francisco"; it later highlighted this retweet when awarding its 2015 "Lie of the Year" badge to Trump's entire presidential campaign.<ref name="Politifact Blacks">{{cite web|title=Trump's Pants on Fire tweet that blacks killed 81% of white homicide victims|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/donald-trump/trump-tweet-blacks-white-homicide-victims/|website=Politifact|access-date=September 21, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920112921/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/donald-trump/trump-tweet-blacks-white-homicide-victims/|archive-date=September 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="2015 Lie of the Year">{{cite web|last1=Holan|first1=Angie|last2=Qiu|first2=Linda|title=2015 Lie of the Year: the campaign misstatements of Donald Trump|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/dec/21/2015-lie-year-donald-trump-campaign-misstatements/|website=Politifact|access-date=September 22, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327081358/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/dec/21/2015-lie-year-donald-trump-campaign-misstatements/|archive-date=March 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The fake statistics were first posted by a neo-Nazi Twitter account.<ref name="Pearce LA Times Wrestling"/>

===="White power" video clip====
On June 28, 2020, Trump retweeted a video showing profane arguments between anti-Trump and pro-Trump protestors in [[The Villages, Florida]], a retirement community. In the video, a pro-Trump protestor can twice be heard yelling "[[white power]]" at the anti-Trump protestors. In his tweet, Trump thanked the pro-Trump protestors shown in the video, calling them "great people".<ref name=BBCVideoSupporter>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-53212685 Trump retweets video of supporter shouting 'white power'], BBC News (June 28, 2020).</ref><ref name=Shear>Michael D.

Many White House officials claimed to have tried to reach out to Trump while the tweet was still up asking him to delete it, but that they couldn't reach him because he had put his phone down while playing golf at his Virginia golf club.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Trump's 'white power' retweet set off 'five-alarm fire' in White House|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-s-white-power-retweet-set-five-alarm-fire-white-n1232495|access-date=2020-06-30|publisher=NBC News|language=en}}</ref>

In a succession of tweets on March 4, 2017,<ref name="politifact-timeline" />{{efn|name=wiretapping-tweets}} President Trump stated he had "just found out" that former president Obama had wiretapped the phones in his offices at Trump Tower during the last months of the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].

[[File:COVFEFE Act.pdf|thumb|upright|The COVFEFE Act]]

On May 31, 2017, Trump sent a tweet that read, in its entirety, "Despite the constant negative press covfefe".

====Comments on Sadiq Khan====
[[File:Sadiq Khan.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Mayor of London]] [[Sadiq Khan]]|left]]
After the [[2017 London Bridge attack]], [[Mayor of London]] [[Sadiq Khan]] condemned it and said that "the city remains one of the safest in the world" and there was "no reason to be alarmed" over the increased police presence around the city.<ref name="Khan-FoxNews1" /><ref name="Khan-Telegraph1" /> The latter comment was taken out of context and criticized by Trump in a tweet: "At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is 'no reason to be alarmed!'"<ref name="Trump-KhanTweet1" /><ref name="Shirbon" />

Trump's comments were described as a deliberate misrepresentation of Khan's remarks by Khan's spokesman,<ref name="Khan-SBS" /> as well as by former U.S. vice president [[Al Gore]]. Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] said that "Sadiq Khan is doing a good job and it is wrong to say anything else".<ref name="Shirbon" /> [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] minister [[Penny Mordaunt]] and [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] leader [[Tim Farron]] also backed Khan. Farron said, "Sadiq Khan has shown calm and dignified resolve in the face of these cowardly terrorist attacks. He is more of a statesman than Donald Trump will ever be."<ref name="Khan-Standard" /> [[Lewis Lukens]], the former US ambassador to the UK, and the [[United States Conference of Mayors]] declared their support, with Lukens commending Khan's "strong leadership" in leading London forward after the attack and also praising the "extraordinary response" from the law enforcement community.<ref name="Khan-FoxNews2" /><ref name="Khan-Telegraph2" /> Trump tweeted the following day that the London Mayor was offering a "pathetic excuse" for his statement, and alleging that the mainstream media were "working hard to sell" Khan's explanation.<ref name="Shirbon" /><ref name="Khan-SBS" /><ref name="Trump-KhanTweet2" /><ref name="MackintoshCNN" /> When asked about these comments following a vigil held near [[Tower Bridge]], Khan stated that he was busy dealing with the aftermath of the attack and declared that he has not "got the time to respond to tweets from Donald Trump".<ref name="MackintoshCNN" />

Trump's sons, [[Donald Trump Jr.]] and [[Eric Trump]], defended his comments and claimed that Khan, who worked along with the security services and held a vigil for victims of the attack, was not doing enough to combat terrorism. Trump Jr. stated that Khan should stop attacking his father, despite the fact that Khan did not respond to Trump's comments.<ref>{{cite news|title=Donald Trump's sons Eric and Donald Jr back his barbed attacks on Sadiq Khan|last=Oppenheim|first=Maya|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-eric-donald-jr-saidq-khan-london-mayor-attacks-terrorism-us-president-a7776721.html|access-date=June 14, 2017|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=June 7, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607122620/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-eric-donald-jr-saidq-khan-london-mayor-attacks-terrorism-us-president-a7776721.html|archive-date=June 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

These countries included [[Foreign relations of Saudi Arabia#Qatar|Saudi Arabia]], [[Qatar–United Arab Emirates relations|United Arab Emirates]], [[Bahrain–Qatar relations|Bahrain]], and [[Egypt–Qatar relations|Egypt]], which cited Qatar's alleged [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|support for terrorism]] as the main reason for their actions.<ref>{{cite news |title=Doha's Actions May Destabilize the Region: Saudi Minister |url=http://newsweekme.com/dohas-actions-may-destabilize-region-saudi-minister/ |access-date=July 2, 2017 |work=Newsweek ME |date=June 14, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614174504/http://newsweekme.com/dohas-actions-may-destabilize-region-saudi-minister/ |archive-date=June 14, 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The severing of relations included withdrawing ambassadors, and imposing trade and travel bans.

On June 29, 2017, Trump tweeted about ''[[Morning Joe]]'' hosts [[Mika Brzezinski]] and [[Joe Scarborough]], who earlier in the day had talked about Trump on their show. The tweets referred to the hosts as "low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe", and claimed that Brzezinski tried to join Trump on New Year's Eve but was declined because she was bleeding from a [[facelift]].<ref name="Grynbaum"/>

The comments were quickly met with condemnation from both the left and the right.

====Joe Scarborough conspiracy theory====
In May 2020, Trump called on Scarborough to be investigated for the 2001 death of Lori Klausutis, who had been one of Scarborough's aides when he was serving in Congress. Klausutis was found dead in Scarborough's district office in [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]], having fallen and hit her head on a desk; her autopsy revealed she had had an undiagnosed heart condition, and her death was ruled accidental. Scarborough himself was in Washington at the time of her death. Trump's tweets claimed that he "would always be thinking about whether or not Joe could have done such a horrible thing" while being interviewed by Scarborough and his "wacky future ex-wife" Brzezinski in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Twitter refuses to delete Trump's baseless claims about Joe Scarborough|last1=Feiner|last2=Wilkie|first1=Lauren|first2=Christine|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/26/twitters-world-leaders-policy-gets-a-new-test-with-trump-tweets.html|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=May 26, 2020|access-date=May 26, 2020}}</ref>

On May 21, 2020, Timothy Klausutis, Lori's widower, wrote to Twitter CEO [[Jack Dorsey]] (the letter was subsequently published by ''The New York Times)'', calling upon him to delete Trump's tweets, pointing out that "an ordinary user like me would be banished from the platform for such a tweet" and accusing Trump of having "taken something that does not belong to him – the memory of my dead wife – and perverted it for perceived political gain". A Twitter spokesperson said the tweets did not violate Twitter's terms of service but added that the company aims to "more effectively address things like this going forward" through updated features and policies.<ref name="KlausutisLetter">{{cite web|title=Timothy Klausutis's Full Letter to Jack Dorsey, and Twitter's Response|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/business/letter-to-twitter-ceo.html?searchResultPosition=1|date=26 May 2020|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=26 May 2020}}</ref> Trump's promotion of the conspiracy drew rare rebukes amongst [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] officials such as [[Adam Kinzinger]], [[Liz Cheney]], and [[Mitt Romney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/499387-gop-lawmaker-calls-on-trump-to-stop-promoting-scarborough-conspiracy-theory-it|title=GOP lawmaker calls on Trump to stop promoting Scarborough conspiracy theory: 'It will destroy us'|first=Justine|last=Coleman|date=May 24, 2020|website=TheHill}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/romney-cheney-call-out-trump-repeating-baseless-conspiracy-theory-about-n1215646|title=Two prominent Republicans call out Trump for repeating baseless conspiracy theory about MSNBC host|website=NBC News}}</ref> In addition, some conservative media outlets, including the [[Wall Street Journal]] and the [[Washington Examiner]] also criticized Trump for promoting the debunked conspiracy. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/business/media/trump-joe-scarborough-conservative-media.html|title='Ugly Even for Him': Trump's Usual Allies Recoil at His Smear of MSNBC Host|first1=Michael M.|last1=Grynbaum|first2=Marc|last2=Tracy|first3=Emily|last3=Cochrane|date=May 27, 2020|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

In September 2017, Trump posted tweets about [[North Korea]] that some saw as violating Twitter's rule against making threats of violence. On September 19, he stated that under certain circumstances, "we will have no choice but to totally destroy #NoKo", and on September 23, "Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!" ("Little Rocket Man" was Trump's nickname for North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]].) In response to user concerns, Twitter cited newsworthiness and whether the tweet is of public interest as factors they consider in whether a tweet violates their rules.

In August 2019, Trump tweeted that Omar and Tlaib resolutely "hate Israel & all Jewish people", and that Israel permitting them to visit the country would "show great weakness".

====Retweeting Jeffery Epstein conspiracy theory====

In August 2019, after the [[death of Jeffrey Epstein]], President Trump retweeted a video from a right-wing comedian named Terrence K. Williams accusing [[Clinton family|the Clintons]] of [[Clinton Body Count|murdering Epstein]], despite the lack of evidence. [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Then presidential candidate]] and [[New Jersey]] Senator [[Cory Booker]] slammed Trump for promoting the conspiracy, saying that he is "whipping people into anger" and that it could lead to violent actions.<ref>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-10/trump-retweets-conspiracy-theory-about-jeffrey-epstein-s-death</ref> Former [[Arizona]] Senator [[Jeff Flake]] also criticized the President, tweeting that it's "not fine to promote conspiracy theroies" and that "we expect more from our President."<ref>https://twitter.com/JeffFlake/status/1161515444202856450</ref> Trump defended the retweet, calling Williams "a highly respected conservative pundit." He also said that "he didn't know" whether or not the Clintons were involved, but mentioned that [[Bill Clinton]] had ridden on Epstein's plane  27 times. While Clinton only rode on Epstein's plane four times, these flights had multiple legs, which is where the theory of Clinton riding Epstein's plane 27 times comes from.<ref>https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/video/trump-defends-promoting-epstein-conspiracy-about-clintons/vp-AAFNgUB</ref>

On July 29, Trump sent out a tweet regarding the change, saying that "people living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream that you will no longer be bothered" about low-income housing being built in their communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/29/trump-suburban-voters-will-no-longer-be-bothered-by-low-income-housing.html|title=Trump tells suburban voters they will 'no longer be bothered' by low-income housing|first=Christina|last=Wilkie|date=July 29, 2020|website=CNBC}}</ref>

====Delaying election====
On July 30, 2020, President Trump claimed that universal mail-in ballots for the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]] will lead to widespread fraud. He then suggested that the election should be delayed until people can safely cast ballots in person. Trump's proposal came with widespread backlash from leaders across the political spectrum, including several [[GOP|Republicans]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/30/trump-delay-election-gop-388290|title=Republicans flat-out reject Trump's suggestion to delay election|website=POLITICO}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/30/politics/trump-election-tweet-republican-reaction/index.html|title=Republicans openly challenge Trump's tweet on delaying election|first=Clare Foran and Manu Raju|last=CNN|website=CNN}}</ref> [[South Carolina]] Senator and Trump ally, [[Lindsey Graham]], said that delaying the election "is not a particularly good idea."

In 2018, Judge [[Naomi Reice Buchwald]] ruled that the plaintiffs "were indisputably blocked as a result of [[viewpoint discrimination]]"; that elements of @realDonaldTrump constitute a [[public forum]]; and that viewpoint discrimination in those elements that are public forums violated the [[First Amendment]].<ref>Epps, Garrett.

===Effects on litigation===
Trump's statements in tweets have been cited in court challenges against his actions as president; his Twitter posts on Muslims have been significant in legal challenges to [[Executive Order 13769]] (which Trump has called a "travel ban"), as courts have considered Trump's statements in assessing the motivations and purpose of the order.<ref name="nyt-lawyers"/> In 2017, Trump's tweets were cited by both the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] and the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which upheld rulings blocking Trump's executive order as unconstitutional.

A tweet posted by Trump's reelection campaign on June 5, 2020 (as well as posted to other social media sites) in the wake of the Floyd protests had included a video with several segments of Trump speaking on the tragedy of Floyd's death and other images. Twitter was forced to remove the video after it had received a [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) takedown request for one of the images used in the video though it was unclear to journalists which image this was. Trump called out the action as "illegal" in a following tweet but Jack Dorsey of Twitter reiterated that they had to follow the law of the DMCA in removing the video.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/twitter-trump-copyright-infringement-george-floyd-video-1234625976/ | title=  Twitter Pulls Down Trump Campaign Video About George Floyd's Death Over Copyright-Infringement Claim | first = Todd | last = Spangler| date = June 6, 2020 | access-date = June 6, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>

==== "Manipulated media" ====
On June 18, 2020, Trump tweeted a falsified video with the CNN logo and the chyron caption "Terrified todler [sic] runs from racist baby; racist baby probably a Trump voter." The implication was that news organizations unfairly malign white people and conservatives. CNN had never run that caption. Twitter applied a fact-check advisory with the words "manipulated media."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Trump|first=Donald|date=18 June 2020|title=Terrified todler [sic] runs from racist baby|url=https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1273770669214490626|access-date=18 June 2020|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref>

==== "Abusive behavior" ====
On June 23, 2020, Trump tweeted that protesters "will be met with serious force." Twitter applied a warning that the comment "violated the Twitter Rules about abusive behavior."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Trump|first=Donald J.|date=23 June 2020|title=There will never be an "Autonomous Zone" in Washington, D.C., as long as I'm your President.

==== "Misleading health claims" ====
On August 23, 2020, Trump tweeted that "Mail Drop Boxes...are not Covid sanitized." He claimed that the Democratic Party was "using" mailboxes despite alleged "voter security" and "fraud" problems with [[Postal voting in the United States|postal voting]]; he claimed that voting by mail enables "a person to vote multiple times," and he questioned "who controls" mailboxes. Twitter applied a warning that the comment violated "our Civic Integrity Policy for making misleading health claims that could potentially dissuade people from participation in voting."<ref>{{Cite web|last=CNN|first=Donie O'Sullivan, Naomi Thomas and Ali Zaslav|date=23 August 2020|title=Twitter hits Trump for 'misleading health claims' that could dissuade people from voting|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/23/politics/trump-twitter-health-voting-claims-flagged/index.html|access-date=23 August 2020|website=CNN}}</ref>

==== "Misleading about an election" ====
Twitter applied a warning to over a third of Trump's tweets made between Election Night 2020 (November 3) and his rival Joe Biden's victory speech (November 7), stating: “some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process.” Twitter then said it would no longer use this election-specific flag given that the election had already been decided.<ref>{{Cite web|last=O'Sullivan|first=Donie, Kaya Yurieff, Kelly Bourdet|date=2 November 2020|title=Twitter will stop hiding and restricting false election tweets, including those from Trump|url=https://edition.cnn.com/business/live-news/election-2020-misinformation/h_dbc979d8d2e88cbe46270435bec52fb1|access-date=8 November 2020|website=CNN|language=en}}</ref>

===Brief deactivation===
Trump's personal Twitter account was deactivated for eleven minutes on November 2, 2017. The official @POTUS account remained online during the period that the personal account was taken offline. The Twitter employee who deactivated the account was Bahtiyar Duysak, who deactivated the account on his last day of work, before he returned to his home country of Germany.<ref>

A 2020 study published in ''[[Nature Communications]]'' assessed Trump's tweets in the context of [[agenda-setting]] theory, analyzing the hypothesis that Trump uses  tweets strategically to divert the attention of the media and the public from issues and topics he considers to be potentially threatening or harmful to him.<ref name=Lewandowsky>Stephan Lewandowsky, Michael Jetter & Ullrich K.

Essayist [[Frank Rich]] of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine argues that Trump's tweets are not purely distractions, but rather (1) are frequently news in themselves; (2) indicate a heightened instability within Trump administration; and (3) are not aimed at news consumers, but rather "are intended to rally his base" of supporters.<ref>Frank Rich, [https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/trumps-tweets-are-not-a-distraction.html Trump's Tweets Are Not a Distraction: They Demonstrate a New Level of Instability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130033253/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/trumps-tweets-are-not-a-distraction.html |date=November 30, 2017 }}, ''New York'' (July 3, 2017).</ref>

Trump was charged less per ad than Clinton was, ''Wired'' claimed,<ref>{{cite news|last=García Martínez|first=Antonio|date=23 February 2018|title=How Trump Conquered Facebook Without Russian Ads|work=[[Wired.com]]|url=https://www.wired.com/story/how-trump-conquered-facebookwithout-russian-ads/|access-date=February 28, 2018}}</ref> but Facebook countered that Trump had been charged more.<ref>{{cite news|title=This Spicy Drama About Facebook CPMs Has People Like "Wahh?"

Trump also used the platform to issue an apology for the [[Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape|''Access Hollywood'' tape]].<ref name="wusa-lewd" /> As president, he was criticized for posting a news story about a purported Kuwaiti travel ban similar to [[Executive Order 13769]];<ref name="msn-fake" /> Kuwait's foreign minister confirmed that no such ban existed.<ref name="reuters-kuwait" />

In 2017, Facebook briefed the House and Senate committees in their investigations of [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|Russian interference in the U.S. election]]. At the hearings, Facebook revealed that accounts linked to the Russian government had bought approximately $100,000 of Facebook advertisements during the election campaign.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/technology/facebook-russian-political-ads.html|title=Fake Russian Facebook Accounts Bought $100,000 in Political Ads|last1=Shane|first1=Scott|date=September 6, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 28, 2018|last2=Goel|first2=Vindu|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In response, Trump criticized Facebook in a series of tweets on September 27, 2017.

===Instagram===
Trump initially used his personal account on Instagram ('''@realDonaldTrump''') primarily to share personal pictures, including images of himself with his grandchildren.<ref name="sfc-instagram"/><ref name="wapo-instagram"/> In September 2015&nbsp;– then with approximately 377{{nbsp}}thousand followers&nbsp;– <ref name="sfc-instagram"/> he used the platform to release a political advertisement. This ad, "[[Act of Love (political statement and advertisement)|Act of Love]]", attacked primary opponent [[Jeb Bush]] on the topic of [[Illegal immigration to the United States|immigration]]. Along with Bush's responses, it demonstrated that Instagram could be a political tool rather than merely a personal photo-sharing application.<ref name="sfc-instagram"/> Trump also used the platform to contribute to the controversy regarding the 2016 film ''[[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|Ghostbusters]]'' by posting a video criticizing the all-female cast. In response, director [[Paul Feig]] claimed that "Trump supporters" were responsible for some of the "internet hate" directed at the film.<ref name="upi-ghostbusters"/>

When Trump became president, his personal account had grown to over 5{{nbsp}}million followers.<ref name="wapo-instagram"/> He also assumed control of an official account ('''@whitehouse'''), where he posted pictures from his inauguration.<ref name="wapo-instagram"/> At that time, it was expected that the official account would primarily feature the work of the [[Chief Official White House Photographer]] once one was selected;<ref name="wapo-instagram"/> however, [[Shealah Craighead]] has contributed relatively little, especially in comparison to [[Pete Souza]]'s work during the Obama administration.<ref name="verge-photography"/>

===Reddit===
On July 27, 2016, Trump took part in an [[/r/IAmA#Concept|Ask Me Anything]] (AMA), where he responded to user-submitted questions from [[Reddit]]'s [[/r/The Donald]] community. He offered replies on topics that varied from [[Media bias in the United States|media bias]] and [[Voter impersonation|voter fraud]] to [[NASA]], including a question about [[H-1B visa]]s posed by alt-right<ref name="StandardWhoIs">{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/who-is-milo-yiannopoulos-everything-you-need-to-know-about-donald-trumps-altright-poster-boy-a3404921.html|first=Phoebe|last=Luckhurst|date=November 25, 2016|publisher=the Evening Standard|website=standard.co.uk|title=Who is Milo Yiannopoulos?

===YouTube===
From 2011 until 2013 or 2014, Trump created over 80 installments of a [[video blog|vlog]] on YouTube called "From the Desk of Donald Trump".{{efn|name=desk}} In it, he discussed a variety of topics, ranging from serious issues such as the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Civil War]], [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Obamacare]], and the American job market to less weighty matters, including the ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' [[Oscar party]] and his dislike of [[Mike McGlone]]'s [[GEICO advertising campaigns|Rhetorical Questions advertisements]] for [[GEICO]].<ref name="cracked-desk"/><ref name="dailybeast-desk"/> In several installments, he speculated on a possible presidential candidacy in 2012 that never came to pass,<ref name="cracked-desk"/> but many of the themes featured in the vlog were part of his successful [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|campaign in 2016]].<ref name="dailybeast-desk"/> By June 2017, most of these videos were no longer available on YouTube under Trump's account.<ref name="youtube-desk"/>{{better source|date=October 2017}}

=== Snapchat ===
On June 3, 2020, [[Snapchat]] announced that it would no longer promote Trump's account on its "Discover" page, which curates stories from celebrities and politicians. The President had previously shared a photo from [[Donald Trump visit to St. John's Church|visit to St. John's Church]], in addition to screenshots of several tweets.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Kang|first1=Cecilia|last2=Conger|first2=Kate|date=2020-06-03|title=Snap Says It Will No Longer Promote Trump's Account|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/technology/snapchat-trump.html|access-date=2020-06-03|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

=== Twitch ===
Trump had a [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] account used primarily to broadcast his rallies. On June 29th, 2020, his account was suspended. Twitch claimed this suspension was made because of violations in their rules against hate speech. They pointed out an incident in 2016 where Trump made comments about rapists, drug dealers, and criminals coming to America from Mexico and an incident in his rally in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] in 2020 where he told a fictional story of a "tough hombre" breaking into someone's home as proof of these violations.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Flood|first=Brian|date=2020-06-29|title=Jeff Bezos' Twitch temporarily bans Trump for 'hateful conduct'|url=https://www.foxnews.com/media/jeff-bezos-twitch-temporarily-bans-trump-for-hateful-conduct|access-date=2020-07-06|website=Fox News|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Bursztynsky|first=Jessica|date=2020-06-29|title=Amazon's video site Twitch suspends Trump's channel, citing 'hateful conduct'|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/29/amazons-video-site-twitch-bans-trump-for-hateful-conduct.html|access-date=2020-07-06|website=CNBC|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Snider|first=Mike|title=Trump's Twitch channel suspended, and Reddit bans pro-Trump online group|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/06/29/trump-twitch-channel-pro-trump-reddit-group-cited-hate-speech/3280356001/|access-date=2020-07-06|website=USA Today|language=en-US}}</ref>

==On the Chinese internet==
Historically in Chinese publications Trump was known as Chuānpǔ ({{zh|c=川普}}), based on the pronunciation of his surname, while recent official publications use Tèlǎngpǔ ({{zh|c=特朗普|labels=no}}). Users on the Chinese internet refer to Trump as Chuānpǔ, instead of Tèlǎngpǔ, and/or various parody nicknames. Ji Siqi of the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' wrote that the informal use is because Chuānpǔ "just has two characters so it’s easier to say or type."<ref name=JiSiqiTrumpChinesenicknames>{{cite web|last=Ji|first=Siqi|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/3108839/what-chinese-internet-calls-trump-boss-emperor-king|title=What the Chinese internet calls Trump: Boss, Emperor, king of knowledge, baby, Comrade Building the (Chinese) Nation |newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=2020-11-07|access-date=2020-11-07}}</ref>

Trump's assertion of his understanding of [[COVID-19]] resulted in the nickname Dǒng Wáng ({{zh|c=懂王|p=Dǒng Wáng|l=king of knowledge}}). A perception that Trump is harming the United States to the benefit of China gave him the nickname Chuān Jiànguó ({{zh|s=川建国|t=川建國|labels=no}}) meaning "Trump Building Country" with the country being China. Additionally he is known as Chuān Bǎo ({{zh|first=s|s=川宝|t=川寳|l=Trump the Baby|labels=no}}), which Ji Siqi compared to the insult "[[Orange Baby]]".<ref name=JiSiqiTrumpChinesenicknames/> Another nickname referring to the Chinese perception of Trump being an authoritarian, which Ji Siqi states "contradicts American democracy as perceived by Chinese people", is Chuān Huáng ({{zh|c=川皇|l=Trump the Emperor|labels=no}}), and Dà Tǒnglǐng ({{zh|first=s|s=大统领|t=大統領|l=Great Commander|labels=no}}).<ref name=JiSiqiTrumpChinesenicknames/> The perception of Trump being, in Ji Siqi's words, "an [[:wikt:avaricious|avaricious]] businessman running [the United States as] a company" resulted in the name Chuān Zǒng ({{zh|first=s|s=川总|t=川總|l=Trump the Boss|labels=no}}).<ref name=JiSiqiTrumpChinesenicknames/> The, in Ji Siqi's words, "very frequent flip-flops", resulted in Tè Méipǔ ({{zh|c=特没谱|labels=no}}) with "mei" being "no"; therefore the literal meaning of "Te Meipu" is "very [[:wikt:capricious|capricious]]".<ref name=JiSiqiTrumpChinesenicknames/>

| quote       = With that tweet, Mr. Trump made another extraordinary intervention into the American judicial system. A president who just last week threatened to stop a Justice Department effort to extradite a Chinese tech executive and who spends most days vilifying the special counsel had now stepped into a complicated legal and ethical case that goes to the heart of the fraught politics of the military’s rules of engagement.
