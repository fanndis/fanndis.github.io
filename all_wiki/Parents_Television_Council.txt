The '''Parents Television Council''' ('''PTC''') is a United States-based [[advocacy group]] founded by [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Christian activist [[L. Brent Bozell III]] in 1995. Through publications on its website including staff reviews, research reports, and web-based newsletters, the Council proclaims television programs or other entertainment products to be beneficial or harmful to the development of children and works to encourage broadcasters and content producers adhere to the council's advice.

Council activities include attempts to hold advertisers accountable for the content of the programs they sponsor, encouraging the development of what the council considers to be responsible, [[family-friendly]] entertainment, encouraging broadcasters to stop and/or limit television content the council says to be harmful to children, as well as pressuring [[cable television in the United States|cable operators]] to unbundle cable channels so consumers can pick and pay for only the channels they want to watch.

The council launches several media campaigns a year against the producers and advertisers of television programs they perceive to be [[Indecency|indecent]]. A typical campaign involves press releases declaring a particular program harmful (often with a list of "unacceptable" character behavior or situations), the organized mass mailing of [[form letter]]s and emails to advertising sponsors of unapproved programs, organized mass filing of complaints via the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) website complaint form, and direct threats of long, potentially costly FCC license challenges to local network affiliates planning to broadcast what the council considers harmful network programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Parents-Protests-CBS-1018806.aspx|title=Parents Council Protests CBS' $#*!

In 2004 the FCC revealed the Parents Television Council as the primary source of most content complaints received.<ref name="NYT2010"/> Throughout its existence, the Parents Television Council has been accused of promoting censorship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sexual-intelligence/201208/parents-television-council-really-loves-the-sin|title=Parents Television Council REALLY Loves the Sin|work=Psychology Today}}</ref>

In November 2010, the PTC released a study, ''Habitat for Profanity: Broadcast TV's Sharp Increase in Foul Language'', which claims that there was a sharp rise in the usage of [[profanity]] between 2005 and 2010—during the 8PM to 9PM ET/PT time period commonly referred to them as the [[Family Viewing Hour]], the PTC claimed that there were 111 instances of profanity during this hour in 2010 versus 10 in 2005; during all of prime time, 276 instances in 2010 against 11 in 2005. The study claimed that there was a 69.3% increase in prime time in general between 2005 and 2010, with the Fox network being heavily accused of bringing a 269% increase for the network during that period. The study also claimed instances in which there was profanity, but the offending word was [[Bleep censor|bleeped out]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/459666-PTC_Report_Notes_Sharp_Rise_in_Primetime_Broadcast_Profanity.php|title=PTC Report Notes &quot;Sharp Rise&quot; in Primetime Broadcast Profanity - Broadcasting & Cable|work=broadcastingcable.com}}</ref>

===Seal of Approval===
To recognize excellence in the media, the Parents Television Council awards its Seal of Approval to television shows, movies, home products, and advertisers that provide or sponsor content it deems to be "family-friendly". It is divided into two categories: Entertainment and Advertiser.<ref>{{cite web|title=The PTC Seal of Approval|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/awards/main.asp|publisher=Parents Television Council|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> Popular television shows that have been awarded include ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[American Idol]]'', ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'', ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]'', ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]'', ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'', ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'', ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', ''[[The West Wing]]'', and ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]''.

==Activism==

===World Wrestling Federation campaign and lawsuit===
In 1999, the PTC launched a campaign against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE), complaining that their ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' program contained levels of sexuality and violence unbecoming prime time programming.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/90544|title=WWF Tones Down Its 'Smackdown' Act|last=Gordon|first=Devin|date=1999-12-13|work=Newsweek|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> In the campaign, Bozell said that four children had been killed by peers emulating [[professional wrestling]] moves learned from the program.<ref>{{cite web|title=PTC Calls MCI Worldcom to the Mat - archived on 31 October 2001 |work=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Parents Television Council |url=http://www.parentstv.org/publications/release/pr20000601.html |date=2000-06-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011106164514/http://www.parentstv.org/publications/release/pr20000601.html |archivedate= 6 November 2001 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117800064.html?categoryid=22&cs=1|title=WWF wins round 1 against parents org|last=Dempsey|first=John|date=2001-05-28|work=Variety|accessdate=2009-06-30}}</ref><ref name="WWF wins Round 1">{{cite news|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2001/may01/may28/3_wed/news7wednesday.html|title=News Shorts - WWF wins Round 1 against parents group|date=2001-05-28|work=Media Life Magazine|accessdate=2009-06-16|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025050900/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2001/may01/may28/3_wed/news7wednesday.html|archivedate=2006-10-25}}</ref> With these allegations, Bozell and various PTC members began meeting with representatives of the advertising departments of various companies that advertised on ''SmackDown!'' to persuade them to withdraw sponsorship. The PTC also suggested that between 30 and 40 advertisers had pulled their commercials from WWF programming, an assertion that was not true.<ref name="WWF wins Round 1"/><ref name="judgereject">{{cite press release|title=Judge rejects Parents Television Council motion to Dismiss Lawsuit |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |date=2001-05-24 |url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2001/2001_05_24.jsp |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609225904/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2001/2001_05_24.jsp |archivedate=2009-06-09 }}</ref>

During the conflict the WWF created the [[Right to Censor]] (RTC) stable, a group of wrestlers that parodied the PTC by portraying them as self-righteous moral crusaders.

===Broadcast indecency===
In 2003, the PTC unsuccessfully campaigned for the FCC to take action against the NBC television network in response to the use of the word "[[wikt:fucking|fucking]]" by [[Bono]], lead singer for the rock band [[U2]], during the network's January 2003 telecast of the [[Golden Globe Awards]]. Among an audience of nearly 20 million, the FCC received only 234 complaints, 217 of which came from the PTC.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2006|p=43}}</ref> In October 2003, the FCC decided not to fine NBC because Bono's obscenity was ruled as fleeting and not describing sexual or excretory functions, the FCC's standard for fining a network for indecency.<ref>{{cite news | title = FCC OKs Bono's F-Word Slip | publisher = CBS News |date=2003-10-07 | url =http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/17/entertainment/main573729.shtml| accessdate = 2008-09-24 }}</ref> After the PTC filed an Application for Review to the FCC, in March 2004 the FCC decided that the word was indecent by law but still decided not to fine NBC; however, the ruling was to serve as a warning to networks that there would be a "zero tolerance" policy towards obscene language willfully used during the daytime.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane|2006|pp=44–45}}</ref> However, the PTC's complaints about profanity used by presenter [[Nicole Richie]] in the December 10, 2003 broadcast of the ''Billboard Music Awards'' led the FCC to conclude that the language violated decency law.<ref>{{harvnb|Lipschultz|2008|pp=133–134}}</ref>

The PTC began attracting more attention after it filed around 65,000<ref>{{cite web|title=Broadcast Indecency Campaign|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/fcc/Complaints.asp|publisher=Parents Television Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503021051/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/fcc/Complaints.asp|archivedate=May 3, 2007}}</ref> complaints to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) about the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy]], in which one of performer [[Janet Jackson]]'s nipple shielded breasts, was exposed for 9/16ths of a second.

[[File:Fcc complaints and fines 2001-2004.JPG|thumb|right|500px|PTC campaigns led to a great increase in FCC-issued fines and received complaints compared to those from previous years.]]

After the halftime show, the PTC launched five more FCC complaint drives, starting March 2004 with an episode of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''[[That '70s Show]]'' titled "Happy Jack", which revolved around character [[Eric Forman]] being caught [[masturbating]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/action/70s/content.htm|title=Content from the March 24, 2004 episode of Fox's That '70s Show|publisher=Parents Television Council|date=2004-03-25}}</ref> The beginning of the [[2004–2005 United States network television schedule|2004–2005 television season]] sparked four new campaigns, the first being against NBC's animated series ''[[Father of the Pride]]'', stating that it contained a "barrage of sexual innuendo and profanity"<ref>{{cite web|last=Winter|first=Tim|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/action/fotp/emailH.htm|title=PTC E-Alert (Father of the Pride)|date=n.d.|publisher=Parents Television Council|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> while being promoted "from the creators of ''[[Shrek]]''", which they felt would potentially attract children to watching the series.

The PTC started off 2005 with their campaign against the ''[[Without a Trace]]'' episode "Our Sons and Daughters", leading to CBS being fined for indecency in March 2006; the PTC objected to the depiction of teenagers participating in an [[orgy]] in that episode.

On January 25, 2008, the FCC proposed an estimated $1.4 million fine against ABC for a scene of female nudity in the ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' episode "[[Nude Awakening]]" aired on February 25, 2003.

The series is based on the popular [[Twitter]] [[Shit My Dad Says|account]] created by Justin Halpern, who also served as one of the co-producers on the show.

===Advertising===
In May 2005 [[Carl's Jr.]] introduced its "Spicy BBQ Six Dollar Burger" in a television advertisement featuring celebrity [[Paris Hilton]] in a swimsuit, soaping up a [[Bentley Arnage]] while leaning on it, and then eating the burger. A similar ad with Hilton for [[Hardee's]] hamburger chain was aired in June 2005.
The Parents Television Council and other media watchdog groups criticized the commercial for being shown during programs that were very likely to be watched by children. Melissa Caldwell, PTC research director, said, "This commercial is basically [[Softcore pornography|soft-core porn]]. The way she moves, the way she puts her finger in her mouth—it's very suggestive and very titillating."<ref>{{cite news| last = James  | first = Meg| title = Critics are saying 'That's Too Hot' of sexy Carl's Jr. ad| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2005-05-24| url = https://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/24/business/fi-paris24| accessdate = 2007-08-05 }}</ref> The group mobilized more than one million members to contact the restaurant chain and voice their concern and claimed that "[i]f this television commercial were to go unchallenged it would set a new standard for acceptable television commercial content." Caldwell, then-president Bozell, and then-executive director Winter appeared on various news programs such as ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', ''[[The Early Show]]'', ''[[American Morning]]'', and ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' to discuss this issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/campaigns/TVads/main.asp|title=TV Ads: Advertiser and Network Campaign|publisher=Parents Television Council|year=2005|accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref> [[Andrew Puzder|Andy Puzder]], CEO of Carl's Jr., says the group needs to "get a life ...

PTC accused television commercials for Hardee's "biscuit holes" food product of suggesting double entendres.

===In-flight entertainment===
In September 2007, the PTC launched a campaign to get [[airlines]] in America to reduce the number of "PG-13" and "R"-rated films shown as [[in-flight entertainment]]. Consequently, [[Heath Shuler]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] representative of [[North Carolina]], introduced the Family Friendly Flights Act of 2007 bill to require airlines to set aside "child-safe" viewing areas for families to sit in planes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Eggerton|first=John|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6485560.html|title=PTC Seeks In-Flight-Video Guidelines|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=2007-09-28|accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref>  The bill never became law.

===Ethics controversy===
In October 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that former PTC vice president of development Patrick W. Salazar had accused PTC of mishandling hundreds of thousands of mailings to donors and members. Based on [[Internal Revenue Service]] filings, the [[American Institute of Philanthropy]] rated PTC "C+" on financial efficiency. Salazar also disputed the PTC's official membership figure of 1.3 million and estimated that at most 12,000 people respond to annual fundraisers. Although Salazar stated that he left the PTC in November 2009, the PTC said that it fired Salazar and that Salazar was trying to extort money from the organization.<ref name="NYT2010"/>

===Other===
The PTC also criticized ''[[The Muppets (TV series)|The Muppets]]'' for not meeting "family viewing" guidelines and suggested a boycott, based on the mockumentary format of the series including mentions of plastic surgery, "inside" business language being used in a crude manner, and the Muppets in a bar consuming alcoholic beverages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w2.parentstv.org/Main/News/Detail.aspx?docID=3296|title=New PTC Research Finds ABC's The Muppets Exposes Kids to Adult-Themed Content Every 3 Minutes|last=Oliver|first=Kelley|work=Parents Television Council|date=October 20, 2015|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref>

In 1997, PTC was twice as likely to rate a show with the toughest rating classification, "red light" in the PTC's case, and "TV-14" in the Guidelines.<ref>{{harvnb|Price|1998|p=143}}</ref> Bill Berkowitz quoted PTC president Bozell as stating, based on PTC research, that "the current ratings system and V-chip are failures."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediatransparency.org/story.php?storyID=62|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427133850/http://www.mediatransparency.org/story.php?storyID=62|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-04-27|title=The Parents Television Council|last=Berkowitz|first=Bill|date=2005-05-11|publisher=Media Transparency|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref> In response to a V-Chip advertising campaign in the summer of 2006, Bozell proposed instead that cable companies either apply FCC-style broadcast television standards or offer choice in ordering channels.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/Parents-group-derides-V-Chip-ads/2100-1028_3-6099408.html|title=Parents group derides V-Chip ads|last=Ogg|first=Erica|date=2006-07-27|work=CNET News|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref> [[Television Watch]] considers PTC's reporting on the V-chip inaccurate and ideologically charged.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.televisionwatch.org/newspolls/pressreleases/pr016.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015418/http://www.televisionwatch.org/newspolls/pressreleases/pr016.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-09-27|title=Parents Want Control of TV|publisher=TV Watch|date=2007-03-15|accessdate=2007-04-22}}</ref>

===Cable choice===
{{Further|Family and Consumer Choice Act of 2007}}
The PTC is an avid supporter of "[[Cable television in the United States#A la carte|a la carte]]" [[cable television in the United States|cable television]] services to allow families to choose only the cable television channels that are appropriate for their children, and also impose the same decency standards already in place on broadcast television on cable channels.<ref>{{cite web | last = Winter | first = Tim | title = Cable Choice is the Right Choice | work = ParentsTV.org | publisher = Parents Television Council | url = http://parentstv.org/PTC/cable/documents/TWCableChoice.asp | accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}</ref> Frequently, the Council has criticized programs on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]], [[Comedy Central]], [[E!]], [[FX (TV network)|FX]], [[MTV]],<ref>{{cite web| last = Eggerton| first = John| title = PTC Doesn't Want Its MTV| work = [[Broadcasting & Cable]] |date=2005-02-01 | url = http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/100322-PTC_Doesn_t_Want_Its_MTV.php| accessdate = 2007-07-30 }}</ref> [[Spike (TV network)|Spike]], [[Turner Network Television|TNT]], and [[VH1]] because they claim some of the content aired on those channels is inappropriate for younger viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parentstv.org/PTC/cable/archives.asp|title=Cable Consumer Choice Campaign|publisher=PTC|accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> On the other side of the issue, the PTC has awarded its "Seal of Approval" to cable networks [[Disney Channel]]<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/news/release/2007/0308.asp|title=PTC Awards Disney for Family-Friendly Advertising Practices|publisher=Parents Television Council|date=2007-03-08|accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref> and [[Hallmark Channel]]<ref>{{cite web| title = Review - Naomi's New Morning | work = ParentsTV.org| publisher = Parents Television Council| date = 2007-05-04| url = http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reviews/naomisnewmorning.asp|accessdate=2009-08-24 }}</ref> for their original programs several years ago.

On June 14, 2007, United States Representatives [[Dan Lipinski]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], [[Illinois]]) and [[Jeff Fortenberry]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[Nebraska]]) introduced into legislation the Family and Consumer Choice Act of 2007, which intends to allow families to choose and pay for only the cable television channels that they want to watch.  In September 2007, the PTC launched a new website, ''HowCableShouldBe.com'', to allow cable customers to see how much they are paying for their monthly cable bill currently.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/news/release/2007/0925.asp|title=PTC Shows Consumers How Cable Should Be |publisher= Parents Television Council|date=2007-09-25|accessdate=2007-10-12}}</ref>

In August 2013, the PTC released a statement criticizing MTV for the airing of a performance by [[Miley Cyrus]] during its [[Video Music Awards]] and urged Congress to pass the Television Consumer Freedom Act.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Strecker|first=Erin|title=Parents Television Council isn't happy with Miley Cyrus' VMAs performance|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/08/26/parents-television-council-miley-cyrus-vmas/|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>

==Popular music==
In April 2008, PTC released ''The Rap on Rap'', a study covering hip-hop and R&B music videos rotated on programs ''[[106 & Park]]'' and ''[[Rap City (TV series)|Rap City]]'', both shown on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]], and ''[[Sucker Free]]'' on [[MTV]]. PTC urged advertisers to withdraw sponsorship of those programs, whose videos PTC stated targeted children and teenagers "with adult content ... once every 38 seconds".<ref>{{cite web|last=Moss|first=Linda|last2=Umstead|first2=R.

In May 2011, the PTC took issue with [[Rihanna]]'s music video for her song "[[Man Down (song)|Man Down]]." In the video [[Rihanna]] portrays a woman who resorts to killing the man who had previously raped her. They claimed the video promoted gun crime and murder, while the pop star said she wanted to be a voice to victims. After the video became the most viewed [[YouTube]] video that week, [[Streisand effect|she sarcastically used Twitter to thank the PTC in helping her make the video such a success.]]<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.nme.com/news/rihanna/57235|title=Rihanna thanks US pressure groups for making 'Man Down' a success|magazine=NME|date=June 11, 2011}}</ref>

==Criticism==
The PTC has been frequently criticized for hypocrisy, slanted reporting and only criticizing shows that are aimed at adults. Critics of the PTC have alleged that it supports increased governmental censorship of television by lobbying the FCC for indecency enforcement for certain television shows<ref name="Television Watch"/> and inaccurately reporting on the [[V-Chip]] in order to further their agenda.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015418/http://www.televisionwatch.org/newspolls/pressreleases/pr016.html Parents Want Control of TV].

''[[Family Guy]]'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]], who is frequently criticized by the PTC, said in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''<ref name="BGFM">{{cite journal |last1=Voss |first1=Brandon |year=2008|title=Big Gay Following: Seth MacFarlane |journal= The Advocate}}</ref>

{{quote|Oh, yeah. That's like getting hate mail from [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. They're literally terrible human beings. I've read their newsletter, I've visited their website, and they're just rotten to the core. For an organization that prides itself on Christian values—I mean, I'm an atheist, so what do I know?—they spend their entire day hating people. They can all suck my dick as far as I'm concerned.}}

In January 2005, [[Bahçeşehir University]] associate professor Christian Christiansen questioned the backgrounds of certain PTC Advisory Board members ([[L. Brent Bozell III]] as 'National Finance Chairman for the 1992 "Buchanan for President" campaign' of "neo-fascist [[Pat Buchanan]]"; [[Susan Howard]]'s portrayal of adulterous [[Donna Culver Krebbs]] on TV series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', which series "was soaked in scantily-clad women, emotional cruelty, violence, alcoholism, and marital infidelity"; Coleman Luck as 'writer and producer' ... 'on "''[[Otherworld (TV series)|Otherworld]]''," "''[[The Equalizer]]''," "''[[Gabriel's Fire|[Gabriel's] Fire]]''," "''[[Matrix (TV series)|Matrix]]''," and "''[[The Burning Zone]]''" [which] ... included a fair amount of death and violence'; [[William Bennett]] as 'a very popular guest at a number of Las Vegas casinos ... gambling'; [[Bruce Jarchow]] appearing in 'less family-friendly products ... such as "''[[The Puppet Masters (film)|The Puppet Masters]]''" (R-rated horror), "''[[Mad Dog and Glory]]''" (R-rated comedy) and "''[[Married ... with Children|Married ... With Children]]''" (crude [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom packed with blatant sexual banter)'; [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], who 'starred in the TV pilot "''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''" made by erotic, anti-family values filmmaker [[David Lynch]]' and 'had the lead in the independent film mega-flop, "''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212458/ Radical Jack]''," the synopsis of which highlights the lunacy of Cyrus being on the board of the PTC: "CIA agent Jack Reynolds (Billy Ray Cyrus) has a score to settle. Five years ago, his family was slaughtered after he tried to break up an illegal arms ring. But now he's discovered the location of the gunrunner who killed his family--and he's going undercover and taking on a whole crooked town in order to get his man!"'; and John Carvelli, 'who, in 1987, "took part in a fact-finding mission in [[Nicaragua]] and [[Honduras]] with the National Conservative Foundation during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaraguan civil war]]."'), as not consistent with their stance on morality.<ref name="Christensen" />

In a December 2005 column of his, ''[[Advertising Age]]'' columnist Simon Dumenco claimed that the PTC is "very very afraid of gay TV characters".<ref>{{citation|last=Dumenco|first=Simon|title=Honey, I Shrank the Cable-TV Universe|periodical=Advertising Age|date=2005-12-12|page=26}}</ref> ''Culture Watch'' columnist Christopher Gildemeister defended the PTC as being "not homophobic" but simply opposed to "sexual references or innuendo (of any variety, hetero, homo or other) aired where children might be exposed to them."<ref name="culture watch 12 26"/>
