Centered on 16th and 17th Avenues South (called Music Square East and Music Square West, respectively, within the Music Row area), along with several side streets, Music Row is widely considered the heart of Nashville's [[show business |entertainment industry]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/music-row-nashville/|title=Music Row, Nashville |encyclopedia= [[Tennessee Encyclopedia]] |date=March 1, 2018|accessdate=15 November 2018}}</ref>

In this area, one will find the offices of numerous [[record label]]s, [[publishing|publishing houses]], [[music licensing]] firms, [[recording studio]]s, [[video production]] houses, along with other businesses who serve the music industry, as well as [[radio network]]s, and [[radio station]]s.

Within media, ''[[MusicRow]] Magazine'' has been a music industry resource reporting on the location for over 30 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=David Ross, Founder of Music Row |work= This Week In Music |number=28 |url=http://thisweekin.com/thisweekin-music/david-ross-co-founder-of-music-row/|publisher=Ian Rogers |accessdate=30 August 2012| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308211639/http://thisweekin.com/thisweekin-music/david-ross-co-founder-of-music-row | archivedate=  March 8, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Lacy J. Dalton]] had a hit song in the 1980s about one of the streets, [[16th Avenue (song)|16th Avenue]], while the area served as namesake to [[Dolly Parton]]'s 1973 composition "[[My Tennessee Mountain Home|Down on Music Row]]". 

Sometimes the term "Music Row" is used as a [[metonymy|metonymous]] nickname for the music industry as a whole, just as "[[Madison Avenue]]" often refers to the [[advertising]] industry. In present years, the district has been marked for extensive historical preservation and local as well as national movements to revive its rich and vibrant history. A group dedicated to this mission is the [[Music Industry Coalition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/music/2016/11/21/music-row-preservation-takes-major-step-forward/94226684/|title=Music Row preservation takes major step forward |first=Nate |last=Rau |work=[[The Tennessean]] |date=November 21, 2016|accessdate=15 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://savingplaces.org/places/nashvilles-music-row#.WsY4dWhOnYU|title=Nashville's Music Row |publisher=[[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]|accessdate=15 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.curbed.com/2016/5/2/11565170/nashville-music-row-historic-preservation|title=To Honor Nashville's Music Row, Entire District Submitted for Historic Recognition |first=Patrick |last=Sisson |date=May 2, 2016|publisher=[[Curbed.com]]|accessdate=15 November 2018}}</ref>

Historic sites such as [[RCA]]'s famed [[RCA Studio B|Studio B]] and [[RCA Studio A|Studio A]], where hundreds of notable and famous musicians have recorded, are situated on Music Row. [[Country music]] entertainers [[Roy Acuff]] and [[Chet Atkins]] have also been memorialized with streets named in their honor within the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/weekly_features/12_07_20_RCA_Studio_B.htm|title=RCA Studio B |publisher= [[National Park Service]]|website=[[National Register of Historic Places]]|accessdate=15 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/music/2017/10/21/rca-studio-a-iconic-signs-after-nearly-50-years/787238001/|title=Iconic signs at Nashville's historic Studio A return after nearly 50 years|work=The Tennessean|first=Joey |last= Garrison|date=October 21, 2017|accessdate=15 November 2018}}</ref>

The first [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] was located at the corner of Music Square East and Division Street from April 1967 to December 2000, but the building has since been torn down and the museum moved to a new state-of-the-art building eleven blocks away in [[Downtown Nashville]] in May 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/03/24/country-music-hall-fame-and-museum-celebrates-50-years/98204248/|title=Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum celebrates 50 years |first=Juli |last=Thanki|date=24 March 2017|work=The Tennessean|accessdate=15 November 2018}}</ref>

One area of Music Row, along [[Timothy Demonbreun|Demonbreun]] Street, was once littered with down-market tourist attractions and vanity "museums" of various country music stars. These began to disappear in the late 1990s with the announced move of the Country Music Hall of Fame. The strip sat largely vacant for a few years but has been recently redeveloped with a number of upscale restaurants and bars serving the Downtown and Music Row areas.

At the confluence of Demonbreun Street, Division Street, 16th Avenue South, and Music Square East is the "Music Row [[Roundabout]]," a [[traffic circle|circular intersection]] designed to accommodate a continuous flow of traffic. Flanking the intersection to the west is Owen Bradley Park, a very small park dedicated to notable [[songwriter]], performer, and publisher [[Owen Bradley]]. Within the park is a life-size bronze statue of Bradley behind a piano. Inside the roundabout is a large statue called the "[[Musica (sculpture)|Musica]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/davidson+/2016/02/25/nashville-roundabout-statue-musica-fountains/80850836/|title=Music Row statue Musica to get fountains |first=Jen |last=Todd|date=25 February 2016|work=The Tennessean |accessdate=15 November 2018}}</ref>

At the other end of Music Row, across Wedgewood Avenue sits the [[Belmont University]] campus, and [[Vanderbilt University]] is also adjacent to the area.  Belmont is of particular note because of its [[Mike Curb]] College of Entertainment & Music Business (CEMB), part of [[Belmont University]] and a major program in its commercial music performance division.
