'''Tarrytown''' is a [[administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] in the [[administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of [[Greenburgh, New York|Greenburgh]] in [[Westchester County, New York]], United States. It is located on the eastern bank of the [[Hudson River]], about {{convert|25|mi|km}} north of midtown [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], and is served by a [[Tarrytown station|stop]] on the [[Metro-North]] [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]]. To the north of Tarrytown is the village of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] (formerly "North Tarrytown"), to the south the village of [[Irvington, New York|Irvington]] and to the east unincorporated parts of Greenburgh. The [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017–present)|Tappan Zee Bridge]] crosses the Hudson at Tarrytown, carrying the [[New York State Thruway]] (Interstates [[Interstate 87 (New York)|87]] and [[Interstate 287|287]]) to [[South Nyack, New York|South Nyack]], [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] and points in [[Upstate New York]]. The population was 11,277 at the 2010 census.<ref name="Census 2010">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Tarrytown village, New York|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=November 18, 2011}}</ref>

==History==

The Native American Weckquaesgeek tribe, who were closely related to the [[Wappinger]] Confederacy and further related to the [[Mohicans]], lived in the area prior to European settlement. They fished the [[Hudson River]] for [[shad]], [[oyster]]s and other shellfish. Their principal settlement was at what is now the foot of Church Street near the Hudson River shore, between the current location of Losee Park and the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017-present)|Tappan Zee Bridge]], at a place they called ''Alipconk'', or the "Place of Elms".<ref name="tarrytowngov">{{cite web|url=http://www.tarrytowngov.com/about-tarrytown/pages/a-brief-history-of-tarrytown|website=Village of Tarrytown|title=A Brief History of Tarrytown}}</ref>

The first European settlers of Tarrytown were [[Dutch people|Dutch]] farmers, fur trappers, and fishermen. Records show that the first Dutch residence in Tarrytown was built in 1645; however, the exact location of this residence is not known.  Tarrytown sits within the lands of the former Dutch Colony of [[New Netherland]] which became English territory in 1674 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]]. The name may come from the Dutch ''tarwe'', meaning "wheat".<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Richard|title=A Brief History of Tarrytown|url=http://tarrytowngov.com/about-tarrytown/pages/a-brief-history-of-tarrytown|website=Village of Tarrytown|accessdate=December 27, 2017|year=2005}}</ref>

In 1780, in a famous [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] incident, Major [[John André]] was arrested as a spy in Tarrytown, which exposed the plans of his associate [[Benedict Arnold]]. André, a British army officer, was traveling south through the village on the [[Albany Post Road]] when he was stopped and searched by three local militiamen. When suspicious papers were found in his boot, he was arrested as a spy, later convicted, and hanged. A circumstantial account of André's capture by militiamen [[David Williams (soldier)|David Williams]], [[John Paulding]], and [[Isaac Van Wart]] was written in 1903 by the owner and publisher of the ''[[Tarrytown Argus]]'', [[Marcius D. Raymond]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Raymond, Marcius D.|url=https://archive.org/stream/davidwilliamscap00raym#page/n5/mode/2up |title=David Williams and the capture of Andre: A paper read before the Tarrytown Historical Society|work= Tarrytown Argus |date= 1903 }} Approx. 35 pp.</ref>

The writer [[Washington Irving]] described Tarrytown in "[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]" (1820). Irving began his story, "In the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators of the [[Tappan Zee]], and where they always prudently shortened sail and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed, there lies a small market town or rural port which by some is called Greenburgh, but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town."<ref name="tarrytowngov" /> The [[Underground Railroad]] ran through Tarrytown prior to the end of the [[U.S. Civil War]].

Tarrytown later became a favorite residence for many rich New Yorkers, including [[John D. Rockefeller]], who first moved to Tarrytown in 1893. [[Kykuit]], Rockefeller's elaborate mansion, was completed in 1906.  In 1914, Kykuit became the site of numerous labor protests by radical [[anarchist]]s, which protests were broken up by police in a series of violent clashes.<ref name="AVR">{{cite book|author=Avrich, Paul|title=The modern school movement: Anarchism and education in the United States|publisher=AK Press|isbn=978-1-904859-09-3|date=2005|page=214}}</ref>  Kykuit was the intended target of at least two bombing attacks planned by anarchists associated with the radical journalists [[Alexander Berkman]] and [[Luigi Galleani]].<ref name="AVR"/>

On November 19, 1915, a powerful dynamite bomb was discovered at Cedar Cliff, the Tarrytown estate of [[John D. Archbold]], President of the [[Standard Oil Company]].<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |work= [[The New York Times]] |title= Dynamite Bomb For J.D.

The [[General Motors]] car manufacturing plant [[North Tarrytown Assembly]] was located in North Tarrytown until 1996.  Today's [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] runs through the abandoned property.

[[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] Mayor Philip Zegarelli, in March 2007, met with Tarrytown Mayor Drew Fixell and district superintendent Howard Smith to discuss forming a [[blue-ribbon panel]] that would explore the pros and cons of an intermunicipal agreement. The two villages have shared a school district for 55 years. The villages already shared some services, as well, to lower their expenses, but the greatest reductions, especially in school and property taxes, would come from merging the two villages. However, each village has its own assessment roll. Zegarelli, who led an unsuccessful attempt in the mid-1970s to disaffiliate Sleepy Hollow from the town of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]], continues to advocate for [[secession]] – Sleepy Hollow from Mount Pleasant and Tarrytown from [[Greenburgh, New York|Greenburgh]] – as another way to save money. "If the idea is to save money, why have two levels of government?" he asked. The town of Mount Pleasant blocked Sleepy Hollow's effort to secede, largely because it did not want to lose tax revenue from [[General Motors]], Zegarelli said.<ref>{{Cite news   | url =http://hudsonindy.typepad.com/blog/2007/04/to_merge_or_not.html   | last =Kott   | first =Andrea   | title =To Merge or Not to Merge   | newspaper =[[The Hudson Independent]]   | date =April 30, 2007   | access-date =February 5, 2008   | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090228085913/http://hudsonindy.typepad.com/blog/2007/04/to_merge_or_not.html   | archive-date =February 28, 2009   | url-status =dead   | df =mdy-all   }}</ref>
