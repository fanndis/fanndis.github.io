The '''impeachment of Donald Trump''', the 45th [[president of the United States]], was initiated on December 18, 2019, when the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] approved [[articles of impeachment]] on charges of [[abuse of power]] and [[obstruction of Congress]]. The [[United States Senate|Senate]] acquitted [[Donald Trump|Trump]] of these charges on February 5, 2020.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2020/02/05/801429948/not-guilty-trump-acquitted-on-2-articles-of-impeachment-as-historic-trial-closes 'Not Guilty': Trump Acquitted On 2 Articles Of Impeachment As Historic Trial Closes] by Philip Ewing, [[NPR]], February 5, 2020, 4:33 PM ET</ref>

Trump's impeachment came after [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump|a formal House inquiry]] alleged that he had solicited [[Foreign interference in the 2020 United States elections|foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election]] to help his [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|re-election bid]], and then obstructed the inquiry itself by telling his administration officials to ignore subpoenas for documents and testimony. The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid{{efn|Intended to help Ukraine in its [[War in Donbass|war against Russian-backed separatist forces in Donbass]]<ref name="Zelensky bowed until luck" />}} and an invitation to the White House to [[Ukrainian president]] [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] in order to [[Trump–Ukraine scandal|influence Ukraine]] to announce an investigation into Trump's political opponent [[Joe Biden]] and to promote a [[Conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal#CrowdStrike|discredited conspiracy theory]] that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference in the 2016 presidential election]].

The inquiry stage of Trump's impeachment lasted from September to November 2019 in the wake of an [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump#Withholding of military aid and July 25 phone call|August whistleblower complaint]] alleging Trump's abuse of power. In October, three congressional committees ([[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]], [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform|Oversight]], and [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs]]) deposed witnesses. In November, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] held a number of public hearings in which witnesses testified publicly; on December 3, the committee voted 13–9 along party lines to adopt a final report. A set of impeachment hearings before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] began on December 4; on December 13, it voted 23–17 along party lines to recommend two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The committee released a lengthy report on the impeachment articles on December 16. Two days later, the full House approved both articles in a mostly party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing along with three Democrats. This made Trump the third U.S. president in history to be impeached and marked the first fully partisan impeachment where a U.S. president was impeached without support from the President's own party (though [[independent politician|independent]] representative [[Justin Amash]], who voted in favor of impeachment on both articles, had previously been a Republican until July 2019).

The articles were submitted to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on January 16, 2020, initiating [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|the trial]]. The trial saw no witnesses or documents being subpoenaed, as Republican senators rejected attempts to introduce subpoenas on January 21 while arranging for trial procedures, and then on January 31 after a debate. On February 5, Trump was acquitted on both counts by the Senate as neither count received 67 votes to convict. On Article I, abuse of power, 48 senators voted for conviction, while 52 senators voted for acquittal. On Article II, obstruction of Congress, 47 senators voted for conviction, while 53 senators voted to acquit. Republican [[Mitt Romney]], the only senator to break party lines, became the first U.S. senator to vote to convict a president of his own party in an impeachment trial, as he voted for conviction on abuse of power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/05/no-senator-ever-voted-remove-president-his-party-office-until-mitt-romney/|title=No senator ever voted to remove a president of his own party from office.

Two days after the acquittal, Trump fired witnesses Ambassador [[Gordon Sondland]] and Lt. Col. [[Alexander Vindman]], who had testified in the impeachment inquiry about the President's conduct, and Vindman's twin brother Yevgeny, according to ''The New York Times'',<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Peter|last2=Haberman|first2=Maggie|last3=Hakim|first3=Danny|last4=Schmidt|first4=Michael S.|date=2020-02-07|title=Trump Fires Impeachment Witnesses Gordon Sondland and Alexander Vindman in Post-Acquittal Purge|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/alexander-vindman-gordon-sondland-fired.html|access-date=2020-06-01|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> while the National Security Adviser, [[Robert C.

== Aftermath ==
Two days after he was acquitted by the Senate in the impeachment trial, Trump fired two witnesses who testified in the impeachment inquiry about his conduct.<ref name=vindsond>{{cite news |last1=Baker |first1=Peter |last2=Haberman |first2=Maggie |last3=Hakim |first3=Danny |last4=Schmidt |first4=Michael |title=Trump Fires Impeachment Witnesses Gordon Sondland and Alexander Vindman in Post-Acquittal Purge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/alexander-vindman-gordon-sondland-fired.html |accessdate=February 9, 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 7, 2020 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200208061052/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/alexander-vindman-gordon-sondland-fired.html |archivedate=February 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=vinsub>{{cite news |title=Trump defends firing impeachment witness Alexander Vindman |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51408704 |accessdate=February 9, 2020 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=February 9, 2020}}</ref> On February 7, Gordon Sondland's ambassadorship was terminated, and Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman was escorted from the White House after a dismissal from his job on the National Security Council. At the same time, Vindman's twin brother Yevgeny, likewise an Army Lieutenant Colonel on the National Security Council, was also dismissed.<ref name=vindsond/> Shortly before the firings, Trump said he was "not happy" with Alexander Vindman; after the firings, Trump said he "didn't know" Alexander Vindman but he was "very insubordinate".<ref name=vinsub/> Alexander Vindman's lawyer responded that his client "was asked to leave for telling the truth. His honor, his commitment to right, frightened the powerful." Sondland reacted by stating that he was "grateful to President Trump for the opportunity to serve".<ref name=vindsond/>

In April 2020, Trump fired [[Michael K. Atkinson]], the inspector general of the intelligence community.<ref>|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/trump-inspector-general-intelligence-fired.amp.html. |accessdate=April 3, 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 3, 2020</ref>
When asked about the firing the next day, Trump criticized Atkinson for having done a "terrible job", stating that he "took a fake report and he brought it to Congress", in reference to the whistleblower complaint of the Trump–Ukraine scandal, which was actually largely verified by other testimony and evidence.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Baker |first1=Peter |title=Trump Proceeds With Post-Impeachment Purge Amid Pandemic |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-post-impeachment-purge.html |accessdate=April 24, 2020 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 4, 2020 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200405041817/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-post-impeachment-purge.html |archivedate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Trump further complained that Atkinson "never even came in to see me. How can you [forward the complaint] without seeing the person?"; he also concluded that Atkinson was "not a big Trump fan".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cook |first1=Nancy |title=Sideshow Don: Trump pursues a non-virus agenda |url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/04/trump-non-coronavirus-agenda-165086 |accessdate=April 24, 2020 |work=[[Politico]] |date=April 4, 2020}}</ref> Atkinson responded that he believed Trump had fired him for "having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial Inspector General, and from my commitment to continue to do so".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bowden |first1=John |title=Outgoing inspector general says Trump fired him for carrying out his 'legal obligations' |url=https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/491283-outgoing-inspector-general-suggests-trump-fired-him-for-carrying-out |accessdate=April 24, 2020 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=April 5, 2020}}</ref>
