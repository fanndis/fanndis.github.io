== Early life ==
Elton John was born Reginald Kenneth Dwight on 25 March 1947 in [[Pinner]], [[Middlesex]] (present day [[London Borough of Harrow]]), the eldest child of Stanley Dwight (1925–1991) and only child of Sheila Eileen ([[née]] Harris; 1925–2017),<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435132/Family-detective-Elton-John.html |title=Family Detective: Elton John |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=22 November 2006 |access-date=26 March 2015 |last=Barratt |first=Nick |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sir Elton John 'in shock' after his mother dies aged 92 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42220913 |access-date=12 November 2018 |work=BBC News | date=4 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sir Elton John's father didn't approve of his career path |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11542512 |access-date=12 November 2018 |work=NZ Herald}}</ref> and was raised in a [[council house]] in Pinner by his maternal grandparents.

When John began to consider a career in music seriously, his father, who served as a [[flight lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Air Force]], tried to steer him toward a more conventional career, such as banking.<ref name="Norman"/> John has said that his wild stage costumes and performances were his way of letting go after such a restrictive childhood.<ref name="VisualDoc" /> Both his parents were musically inclined, his father having been a trumpet player with the Bob Millar Band, a semi-professional big band that played at military dances.<ref name="VisualDoc"/> The Dwights were keen record buyers, exposing John to the popular singers and musicians of the day, and he has said he remembers being immediately hooked on rock and roll when his mother brought home records by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] in 1956.<ref name="Norman"/><ref name="Rosenthal"/> Growing up he states, "I heard [[Little Richard]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and that was it. I didn't ever want to be anything else. I'm more of a Little Richard stylist than a Jerry Lee Lewis, I think. Jerry Lee is a very intricate piano player and very skillful, but Little Richard is more of a pounder."<ref>{{cite news |title=Little Richard, Founding Father of Rock Who Broke Musical Barriers, Dead at 87 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/little-richard-dead-48505/ |access-date=9 May 2020 |work=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

John started playing his grandmother's piano as a young boy,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/11/15/668291963/watch-elton-john-get-worse-at-the-piano-in-time-traveling-christmas-ad|title=Tear-Jerker British Ad Re-Creates Elton John's Christmas Past|work=NPR.org|access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref> and within a year his mother heard him picking out [[Winifred Atwell]]'s "The [[Skater's Waltz]]" by ear.<ref name="Norman"/><ref name="Rosenthal"/> After performing at parties and family gatherings, at age 7 he began formal piano lessons. He showed musical aptitude at school, including the ability to compose melodies and gained some notoriety by playing like Jerry Lee Lewis at school functions. At age 11, he won a junior scholarship to the [[Royal Academy of Music]]. According to one of his instructors, John promptly played back, like a "gramophone record", a four-page piece by [[George Frideric Handel]] after hearing it for the first time.<ref name="Rosenthal"/>
[[File:Royal Academy of Music.jpg|thumb|right|Elton John (known then as Reg Dwight) studied at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London for five years.]]
For the next five years, John attended Saturday classes at the Academy in central London, and he has said he enjoyed playing [[Frédéric Chopin]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and singing in the choir during Saturday classes, but that he was not otherwise a diligent classical student.<ref name="Rosenthal"/> "I kind of resented going to the Academy,” he said. "I was one of those children who could just about get away without practising and still pass, scrape through the grades."<ref name="Rosenthal"/> He has said that he would sometimes skip classes and ride around on the [[London Underground]].<ref name="Rosenthal"/> Several instructors have attested that he was a "model student," and during the last few years he took lessons from a private tutor in addition to his classes at the Academy.<ref name="Rosenthal"/> He left the Academy before taking the final exams.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6455921.stm | title= Sixty things for Sir Elton's 60th | work=BBC News | date=23 March 2007 | access-date=20 September 2019}}</ref>

John's mother, though strict with her son, was more vivacious than her husband, and something of a free spirit. With Stanley Dwight uninterested in his son and often absent, John was raised primarily by his mother and maternal grandmother. When his father was home, the Dwights had vehement arguments that greatly distressed John.<ref name="Rosenthal"/> When he was 14, they divorced. His mother then married a local painter, Fred Farebrother, a caring and supportive stepfather whom John affectionately called "Derf" ("Fred" backwards).<ref name="Rosenthal"/> They moved into flat No.&nbsp;3A in an eight-unit apartment building called Frome Court, not far from both previous homes. There John wrote the songs that launched his career as a rock star; he lived there until he had four albums simultaneously in the American Top 40.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shadyoldlady.com/location.php?loc=1617 |title=ELTON JOHN LIVED HERE |publisher=THE SHADY OLD LADY'S GUIDE TO LONDON |date=3 April 2007 |access-date=27 July 2020}}</ref>

In 1962, John and some friends formed a band called [[Bluesology]]. By day, he ran errands for a music publishing company; he divided his nights between solo gigs at a London hotel bar and working with Bluesology. By the mid-1960s, Bluesology was backing touring American [[soul music|soul]] and [[R&B]] musicians like [[the Isley Brothers]], [[Major Lance]] and [[Labelle|Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles]]. In 1966, the band became [[Long John Baldry]]'s supporting band and played 16 times at the [[Marquee Club]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themarqueeclub.net/long-john-baldry |title=The Marquee Club: Long John Baldry – Biography |publisher=themarqueeclub.net |access-date=25 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704172041/http://www.themarqueeclub.net/long-john-baldry |archive-date=4 July 2010 }}</ref>

When the two first met in 1967, they recorded the first Elton John/Bernie Taupin song, "Scarecrow".

=== Debut album to ''Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'' (1969–1973) ===
[[File:Elton John on stage.jpg|thumb|left|Elton John on stage in 1971]]
On the advice of music publisher Steve Brown, John and Taupin began writing more complex songs for John to record for DJM. The first was the single "[[I've Been Loving You]]" (1968), produced by [[Caleb Quaye]], Bluesology's former guitarist. In 1969, with Quaye, drummer Roger Pope, and bassist Tony Murray, John recorded another single, "[[Lady Samantha]]", and an album, ''[[Empty Sky]]''. For their follow-up album, ''[[Elton John (album)|Elton John]]'', John and Taupin enlisted [[Gus Dudgeon]] as producer and [[Paul Buckmaster]] as musical arranger.

So I wrote [Elton] an e-mail and explained what his music meant to us, and that this song was for Layne. We sent him a demo, and he said it was beautiful and he’d love to play on it. In the studio he was really relaxed and gracious, and he's got a great sense of humor. We were just trying to be cool: 'Oh, yeah, no big deal.' But we were excited.

==Musicianship==
[[File:Elton John Bernie Taupin 1971.JPG|thumb|right|Elton John with Bernie Taupin (left) in 1971. They have collaborated on more than thirty albums to date.]]

Elton John has written with [[Bernie Taupin]] since 1967, when he answered an advertisement for talent placed in the popular UK music publication, ''[[New Musical Express]]'', by [[Liberty records]] [[A&R]] man [[Ray Williams (producer)|Ray Williams]].<ref name="bilb"/> The pair have collaborated on more than 30 albums to date.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/index.php/exhibits/bio/C181 |title=Songwriters Hall of Fame – Bernie Taupin Biography |publisher=songwritershalloffame.org |access-date=26 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618183615/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/index.php/exhibits/bio/C181 |archive-date=18 June 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Their method involves Taupin writing the lyrics on his own, and John then putting them to music, with the two never in the same room during the process.

And it's exciting because it's never changed from the first day we wrote songs. I still write the song when he's not there and then I go and play it to him.

==Personal life==

In the late 1960s, John was engaged to be married to his first lover, secretary Linda Woodrow, who is mentioned in the song "[[Someone Saved My Life Tonight]]".<ref name=RS76>{{cite web |first=Cliff |last=Jahr |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/davidbowie/articles/story/8718858/elton_john_its_lonely_at_the_top |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QZv8N38L?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/davidbowie/articles/story/8718858/elton_john_its_lonely_at_the_top |archive-date=24 July 2007 |title=Elton John: It's Lonely at the Top |work=Rolling Stone |date=7 October 1976 |access-date=25 February 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Myers">{{cite book |author=Paul Myers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l118517OoewC&pg=PA133 |title=''It Ain't Easy: Long John Baldry and the Birth of the British Blues'', page 133 |publisher=Greystone Books, 2007 |access-date=2 February 2010 |isbn=978-1-55365-200-7 |date=6 September 2007 }}</ref> Woodrow provided financial assistance to John and Taupin at the time.

In 1970, right after his first US shows in Los Angeles, he lost his virginity to and started his first gay relationship with [[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]], the Tamla Motown label manager for the UK, who later became John's manager. The relationship ended five years later, although Reid remained his manager until 1998.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Storey |first1=Kate |title=Elton John and John Reid's Relationship Imploded After What We See in 'Rocketman' |url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a27573083/john-reid-elton-john-manager-rocketman-facts/ |website=Esquire |date=30 May 2019}}</ref>

John married German recording engineer Renate Blauel on 14 February 1984, in an extravagant wedding ceremony at [[Darling Point, New South Wales]], Australia.

John had come out as [[bisexual]] in a 1976 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'',<ref name=RS76/><ref name=Myers/> and in 1992 he told ''Rolling Stone'' in another interview that he was "quite comfortable about being gay".<ref>Mary Rhiel, David Bruce Suchoff, {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1o8YQZQhqGoC&pg=PA23 |title=''The seductions of biography'' |page=23 |publisher=Routledge |year=1996 |access-date=2 February 2010 |isbn=978-0-415-91090-3}}</ref>

In 2010, some Christian groups in the US criticised John after he described [[Sexuality of Jesus|Jesus]] as a "compassionate, super-intelligent gay man who understood human problems". [[Bill Donohue]], president of the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights]] and opponent of gay marriage, responded: "To call Jesus a homosexual is to label him a sexual deviant. But what else would we expect from a man who previously said, 'From my point of view, I would ban religion completely.'"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/19/elton-john-jesus-gay |title=Sir Elton John claims Jesus was gay |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=19 February 2010 |access-date=8 March 2015 |first=Adam |last=Gabbatt}}</ref> John stated, in his 2019 ''Me: Elton John Official Autobiography'', that he had received many death threats as a result of his statements.

John said, <blockquote>"There is a world of difference between calling someone your 'partner' and calling them your 'husband'.

John became more closely associated with AIDS charities following the deaths of his friends Ryan White in 1990 and Freddie Mercury in 1991, raising large amounts of money and using his public profile to raise awareness of the disease.

This continues to be one of his passions.
