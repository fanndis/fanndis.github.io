=== Life ===
[[File:Programa de acompañantes - Día 2 (46135399541).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Abe with [[Juliana Awada]], [[First Lady of Argentina]], November 2018.]]
Born {{Nihongo|'''Akie Matsuzaki'''|松崎 昭恵|''Matsuzaki Akie''}}, Akie is regarded as a [[socialite]]. She is from a wealthy Japanese family; her father is the former president of [[Morinaga & Company|Morinaga & Co.]], one of Japan's largest [[confectionery]] companies.

She was educated at [[Sacred Heart School in Tokyo]] (or ''Seishin Joshi Gakuin''), a [[Roman Catholic]] private elementary through high school, then graduated from [[Sacred Heart Professional Training College]]. Abe later worked for [[Dentsu|Dentsu Inc.]], the world's largest advertising agency, before marrying Shinzo Abe in 1987. The couple have no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments earlier in their marriage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Japan PM's wife in rare interview|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6044608.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=October 12, 2006|accessdate=May 25, 2019}}</ref>

In the late 1990s, Abe worked as a radio [[disc jockey]] in her husband's hometown of [[Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi|Shimonoseki]]. She was popular in the broadcast area and was known by her jockey name, "Akky".<ref name="Chosunilbo">{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2006/09/05/2006090561018.html|title=Japan's First Lady-to-Be an Avid Korean Wave Fan|publisher=The Chosunlibo World|date=5 September 2006|accessdate=5 October 2018}}</ref>

Following her husband's first stint as prime minister, she opened an organic [[izakaya]] in the [[Kanda, Tokyo|Kanda]] district of Tokyo, but was not active in management due to the urging of her mother-in-law.<ref name="akie" /> She received a master's degree in Social Design Studies from [[Rikkyo University]] in March 2011.{{fact|date=July 2016}}

=== As wife of Prime Minister ===

Akie became popularly known as the "domestic opposition party" due to her outspoken views, which often contradicted her husband's.<ref name="akie">{{cite news|title=Akie Abe not afraid to speak her mind|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/kuchikomi/view/akie-abe-not-afraid-to-speak-her-mind|accessdate=15 January 2014|newspaper=Japan Today|date=4 January 2014}}</ref> Abe is also known as a supporter of [[sexual minorities]] and the [[LGBT community]]. On April 27, 2014, she joined the [[gay pride parade]] in [[Tokyo]] to show her support for broader rights to [[LGBT rights in Japan|Japan's LGBT community]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/japans-first-lady-akie-abe-joins-gay-parade|title=Japan's first lady Akie Abe joins gay parade|publisher=The Straits Times|date=27 April 2014|accessdate=5 October 2018}}</ref> In 2015, she was photographed standing in a field of cannabis plants promoting the revival of the cannabis culture in Japan.<ref>Johann Hari, [https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/japan-place-with-strangest-drug-debate-in-world/ Japan, the place with the strangest drug debate in the world], ''Opendemocracy.net'', 11 May 2018</ref>

While her husband was in office, Abe developed a close relationship with the [[Moritomo Gakuen]] kindergarten in Osaka, which is noted for its conservative and militarist culture, including requiring students to memorize the [[Imperial Rescript on Education]]. Abe was named as honorary principal of [[Mizuho no Kuni]], an elementary school under development by Moritomo Gakuen, but resigned in February 2017 after it was discovered that Moritomo Gakuen had purchased the land for the school from the government for 14% of its appraised value.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/24/shinzo-abe-wife-akie-under-pressure-ties-ultra-nationalist-school-japan|title=Shinzo Abe and wife under pressure over ties to ultra-nationalist school|last=McCurry|first=Justin|date=2017-02-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The Moritomo Gakuen scandal highlighted the complicated role of the prime minister's wife in Japan: although Abe herself was not considered a civil servant, she was supported by a staff of five civil servants seconded from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, thus implying that her role carries public duties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sentaku-en.com/articles/2017/04/the-abes-caught-in-political-quagmire.html|title=The Abes caught in political quagmire|date=2017-04-01|website=Sentaku|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref>

Abe was the first spouse of a Japanese prime minister to actively use [[social media]], and was particularly personally active on [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]], but dramatically reduced her social media activities and changed the style of her posts in the wake of the Moritomo Gakuen scandal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170410/p2a/00m/0na/007000c|title=Akie Abe's social media silence creates questions|date=2017-04-10|work=Mainichi Daily News|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en}}</ref>
