'''''The Hollywood Reporter''''' ('''''THR''''') is an American digital and print magazine, and website, which focuses on the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[film industry|film]], [[television show|television]], and entertainment industries. It was founded in 1930 as a daily [[trade paper]], and in 2010 switched to a weekly [[Wide-format printer|large-format print]] magazine with a revamped website.

Headquartered in [[Los Angeles]], ''THR'' is part of the Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group, and is owned by [[MRC (company)|MRC]] (formerly Valence Media), a holding company co-founded by [[Todd Boehly]] — an executive of its previous owners, [[Guggenheim Partners]] and [[Eldridge Industries]].<ref name="bloomberg-draftkingsfund">{{cite news| title=Dodgers' Boehly Leads $100 Million DraftKings Investment| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-09/dodgers-boehly-said-to-lead-100-million-draftkings-investment| website=[[Bloomberg News]]| first=Scott| last=Soshnick| date=March 9, 2017| access-date=10 March 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309224456/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-09/dodgers-boehly-said-to-lead-100-million-draftkings-investment| archive-date=March 9, 2017| url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
===Early years===
''THR'' was founded in 1930 by [[William R. Wilkerson|William R. "Billy" Wilkerson]] (1890–1962) as Hollywood's first daily entertainment trade newspaper.<ref>{{cite web| title=Billy Wilkerson| url=https://www.onlinenevada.org/articles/billy-wilkerson| access-date=October 8, 2013| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140613042436/http://www.onlinenevada.org/articles/billy-wilkerson| archive-date=June 13, 2014| df=mdy-all}}</ref> The first edition appeared on September 3, 1930 and featured Wilkerson's front-page "Tradeviews" column, which became influential. The newspaper appeared Monday to Saturday for the first 10 years, except for a brief period, then Monday to Friday from 1940. Wilkerson ran the ''THR'' until his death in September 1962, although his final column appeared 18 months prior.<ref name=Littleton17March2005>{{cite news| last1=Littleton| first1=Cynthia| last2=Byrge| first2=Duane |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com:80/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000845237 |title=Paper Tale |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=March 17, 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009101949/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000845237 |archive-date=October 9, 2007 }}</ref> Wilkerson's wife, [[Tichi Wilkerson Kassel]], took over as publisher and editor-in-chief when her husband died.

From the late 1930s, Wilkerson used ''THR'' to push the view that the industry was a communist stronghold. In particular, he opposed the screenplay writers' trade union, the [[Screen Writers Guild]], which he called the "Red Beachhead."<ref name="Baum">{{cite news| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/blacklist-thr-addresses-role-65-391931| title=The Hollywood Reporter, After 65 Years, Addresses Role in Blacklist| last1=Baum| first1=Gary| first2=Daniel| last2=Miller| date=November 19, 2012| work=The Hollywood Reporter| access-date=December 14, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806111448/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/blacklist-thr-addresses-role-65-391931| archive-date=August 6, 2015| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Holley |first=Val |title=Mike Connolly and the Manly Art of Hollywood Gossip |year=2007 |page=105 |isbn=978-0-7864-1552-6 |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, N.C. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tw-41V4RQjEC |access-date=September 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813180628/https://books.google.com/books/about/Mike_Connolly_and_the_Manly_Art_of_Holly.html?id=tw-41V4RQjEC |archive-date=August 13, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1946 the Guild considered creating an American Authors' Authority to hold copyright for writers, instead of ownership passing to the studios. Wilkerson devoted his "Tradeviews" column to the issue on July 29, 1946, headlined "A Vote for [[Joseph Stalin|Joe Stalin]]." He went to [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]] before publishing it, knowing the damage it would cause, but was apparently encouraged by the priest to go ahead with it.<ref name=Baum/><ref>{{cite news |last=Wilkerson |first=William |author-link=William Wilkerson |date=July 29, 1946 |title=A Vote For Joe Stalin |periodical=The Hollywood Reporter |page=1}}</ref>

The column contained the first industry names, including [[Dalton Trumbo]] and [[Howard E. Koch|Howard Koch]], on what became the Hollywood blacklist, known as "Billy's list." Eight of the 11 people Wilkerson named were among the "[[Hollywood Ten]]" who were [[blacklist]]ed after hearings in 1947 by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].<ref name="Baum"/><ref>Roberts, Jerry (2010). ''The Complete History of American Film Criticism'', Santa Monica Press, p.&nbsp;85.</ref> When Wilkerson died, his ''THR'' obituary said that he had "named names, pseudonyms and card numbers and was widely credited with being chiefly responsible for preventing communists from becoming entrenched in Hollywood production."<ref name=Baum/>

In 1997 ''THR'' reporter David Robb wrote a story about the newspaper's involvement, but the editor, Robert J. Dowling, declined to run it. For the blacklist's 65th anniversary in 2012, the ''THR'' published a lengthy investigative piece about Wilkerson's role, by reporters Gary Baum and Daniel Miller.<ref name="Baum"/> The same edition carried an apology from Wilkerson's son W. R. Wilkerson III. He wrote that his father had been motivated by revenge for his thwarted ambition to own a studio.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/blacklist-billy-wilkersons-son-apologizes-391977| title=An Apology: The Son of THR Founder Billy Wilkerson on the Publication's Dark Past| last=Wilkerson III| first=W.

Matthew King, vice president for content and audience, editorial director Howard Burns, and executive editor Peter Pryor left the paper in a wave of layoffs in December 2006; editor Cynthia Littleton, widely respected throughout the industry, reported directly to Kilcullen. ''The Reporter'' absorbed another blow when Littleton left her position for an editorial job at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in March 2007.

===2009–present===
In December 2009, Prometheus Global Media, a newly formed company formed by Pluribus Capital Management and [[Guggenheim Partners]], and chaired by Jimmy Finkelstein, CEO of News Communications, parent of political journal ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', acquired ''THR'' from Nielsen Business Media. It pledged to invest in the brand and grow the company. [[Richard Beckman]], formerly of [[Condé Nast]], was appointed as CEO.

In 2010, Beckman recruited [[Janice Min]], the former editor-in-chief of ''[[Us Weekly]]'', as Editorial Director to "eviscerate" the existing daily trade paper and reinvent it as a glossy, large-format weekly magazine.<ref>{{cite news| last=Barnes| first=Brooks| title=Hollywood Reporter to Become a Weekly Magazine| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/business/media/13hollywood.html?pagewanted=all| work=The New York Times| access-date=October 11, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905144321/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/business/media/13hollywood.html?pagewanted=all| archive-date=September 5, 2017| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.minonline.com/most-intriguing-a-marquee-year-for-richard-beckman-in-2011/| title=Most Intriguing: A Marquee Year for Richard Beckman in 2011?| date=November 22, 2010| newspaper=min Online| access-date=2016-12-09| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116015939/http://www.minonline.com/most-intriguing-a-marquee-year-for-richard-beckman-in-2011/| archive-date=November 16, 2016| df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''The Hollywood Reporter'' relaunched with a weekly print edition and a revamped website that enabled it to break news. Eight months after its initial report, ''[[The New York Times]]'' took note of the many scoops ''THR'' had generated, adding that the new glossy format seemed to be succeeding with its "rarefied demographic", stating, "They managed to change the subject by going weekly... The large photos, lush paper stock and great design are a kind of narcotic here."<ref>{{cite news| last=Carr| first=David| title=An Outsider Making Waves in Hollywood| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/30/business/media/30carr.html?pagewanted=all| work=The New York Times| access-date=October 11, 2013| date=May 29, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006132629/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/30/business/media/30carr.html?pagewanted=all| archive-date=October 6, 2014| url-status=live}}</ref>

By February 2013' the ''Times'' returned to ''THR'', filing a report on a party for [[Academy Award]] nominees the magazine had hosted at the Los Angeles restaurant [[Spago]]. Noting the crowd of top celebrities in attendance, the ''Times'' alluded to the fact that many [[Hollywood]] insiders were now referring to ''THR'' as "the new ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''". Ad sales since Min's hiring were up more than 50%, while traffic to the magazine's website had grown by 800%.<ref>{{cite news| last=Barnes| first=Brooks| title=From Has-Been to Life of the Party| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/fashion/the-hollywood-reporter-dusts-off-its-party-clothes.html| work=The New York Times| access-date=October 11, 2013| date=February 15, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226035434/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/fashion/the-hollywood-reporter-dusts-off-its-party-clothes.html| archive-date=February 26, 2013| url-status=live}}</ref>

In April 2020, Belloni announced he was abruptly stepping down after 14 years at the publication in the wake of recent clashes with the company’s leadership over editorial issues. Allegedly, Asif Satchu and Modi Wiczyk, co-CEOs of parent company Valence Media, have pushed the editorial staffs at its publications to not run stories, to spike unfavorable stories about friends, and to overpromote Valence-owned businesses like Dick Clark Productions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/hollywood-reporter-matthew-belloni-steps-down-editorial-independence/|title=Hollywood Reporter Editorial Director Matthew Belloni Exits Abruptly|date=April 6, 2020}}</ref>

==Editions==
===Print===
The weekly print edition of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' includes profiles, original photography and interviews with entertainment figures; articles about major upcoming releases and product launches; film reviews and [[film festival]] previews; coverage of the latest industry deals, TV ratings, box-office figures and analysis of global entertainment business trends and indicators; photos essays and reports from premieres and other red-carpet events; and the latest on Hollywood fashion and lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Website===
The ''Reporter'' published a primitive "[[satellite]]" [[Digital data|digital]] edition in the late 1980s. It became the first daily entertainment trade paper to start a website in 1995.<ref>{{cite web| last=Clinard| first=Josh| title=Covering the entertainment biz: Hollywood Reporter vs. Variety| url=http://sabew.org/2012/05/covering-the-entertainment-biz-hollywood-reporter-vs-variety/| publisher=[[Society of American Business Editors and Writers]]| access-date=October 11, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718201052/http://sabew.org/2012/05/covering-the-entertainment-biz-hollywood-reporter-vs-variety/| archive-date=July 18, 2013| url-status=dead}}</ref> Initially, the site offered free news briefs with complete coverage firewalled as a premium paid service. In later years, the website became mostly free as it became more reliant on ad sales and less on subscribers. The website had already gone through a redesign by the time competitor ''Variety'' took to the web in 1998. In 2002 the ''Reporter''{{'}}s website won the Jesse H. Neal Award for business journalism. In November 2013, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' launched the style site Pret-a-Reporter.<ref>{{cite news| title=The Hollywood Reporter Launches New Style Website Pret-A-Reporter| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/thr-launches-pret-a-reporter-655564| work=The Hollywood Reporter| date=November 13, 2013| access-date=September 4, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905100028/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/thr-launches-pret-a-reporter-655564| archive-date=September 5, 2017| url-status=live}}</ref>

THR.com, ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s website, re-launched in 2010, offers breaking entertainment news, reviews and blogs; original video content (and film and TV clips) and photo galleries; plus in-depth movie, television, music, awards, style, technology and business coverage. As of August 2013, Comscore measured 12 million unique visitors per month to the site.<ref>{{cite web| title=Comscore subscriber data| url=http://www.comscore.com| publisher=[[Comscore]]| access-date=October 11, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601070749/http://www.comscore.com/| archive-date=June 1, 2008| url-status=live}}</ref>

==Editors and reporters==

''THR'''s editors have included [[Janice Min]] (2010–2017), Elizabeth Guider (2007–2010), Cynthia Littleton (2005–2007), Howard Burns (2001–2006), Anita Busch (1999–2001), and Alex Ben Block (1990–1999).

Alex Ben Block was hired as editor for special issues in 1990, and was promoted to editor of the daily edition in 1992.<ref name=block>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-01-07-fi-1728-story.html|title=Alex Ben Block, a veteran entertainment industry...|date=January 7, 1992|website=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> After Block left, former ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' film editor, Anita Busch, became editor between 1999 and 2001. Busch was credited with making the paper competitive with ''Variety''.

In March 2006, Cynthia Littleton, former broadcast television editor and deputy editor, was named editor, but left the role a year later for an editorial job at ''Variety''.<ref name=depart /> In July 2007 ''THR'' named Elizabeth Guider as its new editor. An 18-year veteran of ''Variety'', where she served as Executive Editor, Guider assumed responsibility for the editorial vision and strategic direction of ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s daily and weekly editions, digital content offerings and executive conferences. Guider left ''The Hollywood Reporter'' in early 2010.<ref name=H411>{{cite news| title=The Hollywood Reporter Sheds Editor, Heads to Tabloid Land| url=https://www.showbiz411.com/2010/10/11/the-hollywood-reporter-sheds-editor-heads-to-tabloid-land| first=Roger| last=Friedman| date=October 11, 2010| work=[[Hollywood 411]]| access-date=September 4, 2017| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905094750/http://www.showbiz411.com/2010/10/11/the-hollywood-reporter-sheds-editor-heads-to-tabloid-land| archive-date=September 5, 2017| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

''The Hollywood Reporter'' has a staff of roughly 150.{{when|date=April 2020}} In addition to hiring Eric Mika, Rose Eintstein and Elizabeth Guider, the ''Reporter'' hired the following staff in 2007:
* Todd Cunningham, former assistant managing editor of the ''[[LA Business Journal]]'', as National Editor for ''The Hollywood Reporter'': Premier Edition
* Steven Zeitchik as Senior Writer, based in New York, where he provide news analysis and features for the Premiere Edition
* Melissa Grego, former managing editor of ''[[TV Week]]'', as Editor of HollywoodReporter.com
* Jonathan Landreth as the new Asian bureau chief, in addition to 13 new writers across Asia

However, staffing levels began to drop again in 2008. In April, Nielsen Business Media eliminated between 40 and 50 editorial staff positions at ''The Hollywood Reporter'' and its sister publications: ''Adweek'', ''Brandweek'', ''Editor & Publisher'' and ''Mediaweek.''<ref name="PaidContent">{{cite news| title=Nielsen Business Media Lays Off Between 40-50; Mainly Editorial| first=Rafat| last=Ali| date=April 10, 2008| url=http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-nielsen-business-media-lays-off-between-40-50-mainly-editorial| publisher=[[Gigaom]]| access-date=September 4, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317021806/http://www.paidcontent.org/entry/419-nielsen-business-media-lays-off-between-40-50-mainly-editorial| archive-date=March 17, 2009| url-status=live}}</ref> In December, another 12 editorial positions were cut at the trade paper.<ref name="DeadlineHollywood">{{cite news| title=UPDATE: Layoffs Gut Hollywood Reporter; Variety's Stylephile Victim Of Recession| url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/layoffs-at-hollywood-reporter-12-the-staff/| website=Deadline Hollywood| date=December 4, 2008| access-date=February 18, 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219001954/http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/layoffs-at-hollywood-reporter-12-the-staff/| archive-date=February 19, 2009| url-status=live}}</ref> In addition, 2008 saw substantial turnover in the online department: THR.com Editor Melissa Grego left her position in July to become executive editor of ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'',<ref name="BroadcastCable">{{cite journal| url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/114455-Melissa_Grego_Joins_B_C_as_Executive_Editor.php| title=Melissa Grego Joins B&C as Executive Editor| publisher=Broadcast & Cable| date=July 8, 2008| access-date=February 18, 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318010947/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/114455-Melissa_Grego_Joins_B_C_as_Executive_Editor.php| archive-date=March 18, 2009| url-status=live}}</ref> and Managing Editor Scott McKim left to become a new media manager at [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]].

When [[Janice Min]] and Lori Burgess came on board in 2010, the editorial and sales staff increased nearly 50%, respectively. Min hired various recognized journalists in the entertainment industry, most notably ''Variety'' film critic [[Todd McCarthy]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/todd-mccarthy-joins-hollywood-reporter-21514/|title=Todd McCarthy Joins The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> after his firing from ''Variety'' in March 2010, as well as [[Kim Masters]] of NPR, Tim Goodman of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Lacey Rose of ''[[Forbes]]'', and Pamela McClintock of ''Variety''.

==Competition and lawsuits==
''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was established in 1905 in [[New York City]] as a weekly trade paper, initially covering [[vaudeville]], [[Tin Pan Alley]] and the city's [[Theater District]]. In 1932, ''Variety'' sued ''The Hollywood Reporter'' for $46,500 for plagiarism, alleging that ''THR'' was plagiarizing information from ''Variety'' following its publication in New York on Tuesdays, by way of phoning or wiring the information back to Hollywood, so that ''THR'' could publish the information before ''Variety'' reached Hollywood three days later on Friday.<ref name="Variety1932">{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety105-1932-01#page/n1/mode/1up|title='Variety' Charges Hollywood Daily of Stealing Its News Each Week|date=January 5, 1932|work=Variety|page=2|access-date=March 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317183137/http://www.archive.org/stream/variety105-1932-01#page/n1/mode/1up|archive-date=March 17, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Then, in 1933, ''Variety'' started its own daily Hollywood edition, ''Daily Variety'', to cover the film industry.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety111-1933-09#page/n91/mode/1up|title=Daily Variety on Coast|access-date=March 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317181142/http://www.archive.org/stream/variety111-1933-09#page/n91/mode/1up|archive-date=March 17, 2017|url-status=live}} Variety, September 12, 1933 p. 5</ref>

From 1988 to 2014, ''Daily Variety'' and ''The Hollywood Reporter'' were both located on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] along [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles|Miracle Mile]]. In March 2007, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' surpassed ''Daily Variety'' to achieve the largest total distribution of any entertainment daily.<ref>ABC Publisher's Statement, as compared to Variety and Daily Variety, March 2007</ref>

In 2011, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', a property of [[Penske Media Corporation]], sued ''The Hollywood Reporter'' for more than $5 million, alleging [[copyright infringement]]. In 2013 ''THR''{{'}}s parent company settled the suit. According to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', "The lawsuit [was] widely viewed in Hollywood as a proxy for the bitter war for readers and advertising dollars... The two sides agreed on a statement reading in part: 'Prometheus admits that ''The Hollywood Reporter'' copied source code from Penske Media Corporation's Web site www.tvline.com; Prometheus and ''The Hollywood Reporter'' have apologized to Penske Media.'"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324685104578390833241825180 |title=Owners of Competing Hollywood Publications Settle Copyright Lawsuit |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |access-date=October 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611142340/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324685104578390833241825180 |archive-date=June 11, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

''The Hollywood Reporter'' maintained a business association with the home entertainment trade publication ''[[Home Media Magazine]]'', owned by Questex Media Group. It gave ''THR'' access into the home entertainment trade, which ''Variety'' similarly enjoyed with its former sister publication, the Reed-owned ''Video Business''.

==Current status and legacy==
''The Hollywood Reporter'' published out of the same offices on [[Sunset Boulevard]] for more than a half century. It is headquartered in [[Los Angeles|L.A.]]'s [[Mid-Wilshire]] district.
