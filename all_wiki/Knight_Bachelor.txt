The title of '''Knight Bachelor''' is the basic rank granted to a man who has been [[knight]]ed by the monarch but not inducted as a member of one of the organised [[Chivalric order|orders of chivalry]]; it is a part of the [[British honours system]].<ref name="Churchill_Society">{{Cite web|url=http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/HnrSystm.html|title=The British Honours System|website=www.churchill-society-london.org.uk|access-date=2017-05-23}}</ref> Knights Bachelor are the most ancient sort of British knight<ref>{{cite book |

A man who is knighted is formally addressed as "Sir [First Name] [Surname]" or "Sir [First Name]" and his wife as "Lady [Surname]".

==Criteria==
Knighthood is usually conferred for public service; amongst its recipients are all male judges of [[Her Majesty's High Court of Justice in England]]. It is possible to be a Knight Bachelor and a junior member of an order of chivalry without being a knight of that order; this situation has become rather common, especially among those recognised for achievements in entertainment. For instance, Sir [[Michael Gambon]], Sir [[Derek Jacobi]], Sir [[Anthony Hopkins]], Sir [[Elton John]], Sir [[Peter Stearns]], Sir [[Michael Caine]], Sir [[Barry Gibb]] and Sir [[Ian McKellen]] are Commanders of the [[Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] (CBEs); Sir [[Patrick Stewart]], Sir [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] and Sir [[Van Morrison]] are Officers of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBEs); while Sir [[Paul McCartney]] and Sir [[Ringo Starr|Richard Starkey]] (Ringo Starr) are Members of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE). None of them would be entitled to use the honorific "Sir" by virtue of their membership of the order alone, but as they are all also Knights Bachelor, they are entitled to preface their names with that title.

==Honorifics and post-nominal letters==
Knights Bachelor may prefix "Sir" to their forenames and wives of Knights may prefix "Lady" to their surnames.<ref name="Churchill_Society" /><ref name="Imperial_Society_Address">{{cite web|title=Form of address|url=http://www.iskb.co.uk/INFORMATION.htm|publisher=Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor|accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref><ref name="Debretts_Knight_Bachelor">{{cite web|title=Knight Bachelor|url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/knight/knight-bachelor |work=Forms of address |publisher=Debrett's |accessdate=17 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405124949/http://www.debretts.com/forms-address/titles/knight/knight-bachelor |archivedate= 5 April 2014 }}</ref> Since recipients are not knights of an [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Current orders of chivalry|order of chivalry]] there are no [[post-nominal|post-nominal letters]] associated with the honour,<ref name="Honours_Gov_UK">{{cite web|url=http://www.honours.gov.uk/honours/chivalry.aspx|title=Orders of Chivalry|publisher=British Government|accessdate=30 August 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819024713/http://www.honours.gov.uk/honours/chivalry.aspx|archivedate=19 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> however when the style "Sir" is awkward or incomplete due to a subsequent appointment, recipients may use the letters "Kt" after their name (note the lowercase "t" which distinguishes it from [[Knight of the Thistle|"KT"]]). This style is often adopted by Knights Bachelor who are also [[Peerage|peers]], [[Baronet|baronets]], or knights of the various [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Current orders of chivalry|chivalric orders]].<ref name="Imperial_Society_Address" /> In legal and official documents "Knight" should be added after the name instead of "Kt".<ref name="Debretts_Knight_Bachelor" />

==Insignia==

Until 1926 Knights Bachelor had no insignia which they could wear, but in that year [[King George V]] issued a warrant authorising the wearing of a badge on all appropriate occasions by Knights Bachelor; this badge is worn on the left side of the coat or outer garment. Measuring {{convert|2+3/8|in}} in length and {{convert|1+3/8|in}} in width, it is described in [[Heraldry|heraldic]] terms as follows:<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Debrett's Peerage & Baronetage 2019|last=|first=|publisher=Debrett's|year=2019|isbn=9781999767006|location=https://www.debretts.com/product/debretts-peerage/|pages=}}</ref> 

<blockquote>Upon an oval medallion of [[vermilion]], enclosed by a [[scroll]] a cross-hilted sword belted and sheathed, [[Hilt#Pommel|pommel]] upwards, between two [[spur]]s, [[rowel]]s upwards, the whole set about with the sword belt, all gilt.</blockquote>

In 1974, [[Queen Elizabeth II]] issued a further warrant authorising the wearing on appropriate occasions of a neck badge, slightly smaller in size, and in miniature. In 1988 a new certificate of authentication, a knight's only personal documentation, was designed by the [[College of Arms]].<ref name=":0" />

==Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor==
The [[Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor]] was founded for the maintenance and consolidation of the Dignity of Knights Bachelor in 1908, and obtained official recognition from the Sovereign in 1912. The Society keeps records of all Knights Bachelor, in their interest.

==Equivalence==
There is no female counterpart to Knight Bachelor. The lowest knightly honour that can be conferred upon a woman is [[Order of the British Empire|Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] (DBE), which is one rank higher than Knight Bachelor (being the female equivalent of KBE or [[Order of the British Empire|Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]], which is the next male knightly rank above Knight Bachelor). 

Only British subjects can be created Knights Bachelor; people of other nationalities are generally made [[Order_of_the_British_Empire#Styles_and_honorary_knighthoods|honorary]] KBEs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iskb.co.uk/history.htm|title=Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor|website=www.iskb.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-23}}</ref>
