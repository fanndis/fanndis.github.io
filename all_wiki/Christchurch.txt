'''Christchurch''' ({{IPAc-en|'|k|r|aɪ|s|(|t|)|tʃ|ɜr|tʃ}}; {{lang-mi|Ōtautahi}}) is the largest city in the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]] and the seat of the [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury Region]]. The Christchurch urban area lies on the South Island's east coast, just north of [[Banks Peninsula]]. The urban area is home to {{NZ population data 2018|Christchurch|y}} residents,<ref name="NZ_population_data_2018"/> and the territorial authority has {{NZ population data 2018|Christchurch city|y}} people,{{NZ population data 2018||||y}} which makes it the second-most<!-- see [[List of cities in New Zealand]] for details --> populous city in New Zealand after [[Auckland]] and before [[Wellington]]. The [[Avon River (Canterbury)|Avon River]] flows through the centre of the city, with an urban park located along its banks.

Archaeological evidence has indicated that people first settled in the Christchurch area in about 1250. Christchurch became a city by [[Royal Charter]] on 31 July 1856, making it officially the oldest established city in New Zealand. The [[Canterbury Association]], which settled the [[Canterbury Plains]], named the city after [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. The new settlement was laid out in a [[grid pattern]] centred on [[Cathedral Square, Christchurch|Cathedral Square]]; during the 19th century there were few barriers to the rapid growth of the urban area, except for the Pacific to the east and the [[Port Hills]] to the south.

[[Agriculture in New Zealand|Agriculture]] is the historic mainstay of Christchurch's economy. The early presence of the [[University of Canterbury]] and the heritage of the city's academic institutions in association with local businesses has fostered a number of technology-based industries. Christchurch is one of five 'gateway cities' for [[History of Antarctica|Antarctic exploration]], hosting Antarctic support bases for several nations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Christchurch – Gateway to Antarctica |url=http://www.antarcticanz.govt.nz/about-us/christchurch-gateway-to-antarctica/ |publisher=Antarctica New Zealand |access-date=23 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323210404/http://www.antarcticanz.govt.nz/about-us/christchurch-gateway-to-antarctica/ |archive-date=23 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city suffered [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|a series of earthquakes]] between September 2010 and January 2012, with the most destructive of them occurring at 12.51 p.m. on 22 February 2011, in which 185 people were killed and thousands of buildings across the city collapsed or suffered severe damage. By late 2013, 1,500 buildings in the city had been demolished, leading to an ongoing recovery and rebuilding project. The city later became the site of [[Christchurch mosque shootings|a terrorist attack]] targeting two mosques on 15 March 2019, in which 51 people were killed, and which was described by [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[Jacinda Ardern]] as "one of New Zealand's darkest days".

==Names==
The name of "Christchurch" was agreed on at the first meeting of the [[Canterbury Association]] on 27 March 1848. It was suggested by founder [[John Robert Godley]], whose [[alma mater]] was [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[University of Oxford]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last1=Cowie|first1=D.

The [[Māori language|Māori]] name ''Ōtautahi'' ("the place of Tautahi") was adopted in the 1930s; originally it was the name of a specific site by the Avon River (near present-day Kilmore Street).<ref>{{cite web|title=Ōtautahi – Christchurch|url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/otautahi/|publisher=Christchurch City Libraries|accessdate=15 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101022827/http://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/otautahi/|archive-date=1 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The site was a seasonal dwelling of [[Ngāi Tahu]] chief [[Te Potiki Tautahi]], whose main home was [[Port Levy]] on [[Banks Peninsula]]. Prior to that the Ngāi Tahu generally referred to the Christchurch area as ''Karaitiana'',<ref>[http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/tikoukawhenua/otautahi/ Ōtautahi] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725065207/http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/tikoukawhenua/otautahi/ |date=25 July 2011 }} (from the Christchurch City Library website)</ref> a transliteration of the English word [[Christianity|Christian]].

"ChCh" is sometimes used as an abbreviation of "Christchurch".

==History==
{{see also|History of the Canterbury Region}}

===Māori settlement===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
Archaeological evidence found in a cave at [[Redcliffs]] in 1876 has indicated that the Christchurch area was first settled by [[moa]]-hunting tribes about 1250 CE. These first inhabitants were thought to have been followed by the [[Waitaha (South Island iwi)|Waitaha]] iwi, who are said to have migrated from the East coast of the North Island in the 16th century. Following tribal warfare, the Waitaha (made of three peoples) were dispossessed by the [[Kāti Māmoe|Ngāti Māmoe]] iwi. They were in turn subjugated by the [[Ngāi Tahu]] iwi, who remained in control until the arrival of European settlers.

===European settlement===
Following the purchase of land at Putaringamotu (modern Riccarton) by the [[Weller brothers]], whalers of [[Otago]] and Sydney, a party of European settlers led by Herriott and McGillivray established themselves in what is now Christchurch, early in 1840. Their abandoned holdings were taken over by brothers [[William Deans|William]] and [[John Deans (pioneer)|John Deans]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.riccartonhouse.co.nz/deans_cottage/ |title=Deans cottage web site |publisher=Riccartonhouse.co.nz |accessdate=23 February 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724194344/http://www.riccartonhouse.co.nz/deans_cottage/ |archive-date=24 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in 1843 who stayed. The [[First Four Ships]] were chartered by the [[Canterbury Association]] and brought the first 792 of the ''Canterbury Pilgrims'' to [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton Harbour]]. These sailing vessels were the ''[[Randolph (ship)|Randolph]]'', ''[[Charlotte Jane]]'', {{ship||Sir George Seymour|1844 ship|2}}, and ''[[Cressy (ship)|Cressy]]''. The ''Charlotte Jane'' was the first to arrive on 16 December 1850. The Canterbury Pilgrims had aspirations of building a city around a cathedral and college, on the model of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] in [[Oxford]].<ref>[http://www.christchurchcathedral.co.nz/discover/cathedral_history.html Cathedral History] (from the official [[ChristChurch Cathedral]] website). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017103748/http://christchurchcathedral.co.nz/discover/cathedral_history.html |date=17 October 2007 }}</ref>

The name "Christ Church" was decided prior to the ships' arrival, at the Association's first meeting, on 27 March 1848. The exact basis for the name is not known. It has been suggested that it is named for [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], in [[Dorset]], England; for [[Canterbury Cathedral]]; or in honour of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], Oxford. The last explanation is the one generally accepted.<ref name=":0" />

At the request of the Deans brothers — whose farm was the earliest European settlement in the area – the river was named after the [[River Avon, Falkirk|River Avon]] in Scotland, which rises in the [[Ayrshire]] hills near to where their grandfather's farm was located.<ref name="HIGHT">''A History of Canterbury'', Vol. 1 – Sir James Hight & Straubel, C.R.; Canterbury Centennial Association and Whitcombe and Tombs, Christchurch 1957, Page 121</ref>

Captain [[Joseph Thomas (surveyor)|Joseph Thomas]], the Canterbury Association's Chief Surveyor, surveyed the surrounding area. By December 1849 he had commissioned the construction of a road from Port Cooper, later [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]], to Christchurch via [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://library.christchurch.org.nz/Heritage/EarlyChristchurch/JosephThomas.asp |title=Captain Thomas and the Streets of Christchurch|publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|access-date=14 May 2008|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080829232049/http://library.christchurch.org.nz/Heritage/EarlyChristchurch/JosephThomas.asp |archive-date=29 August 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> However, this proved more difficult than expected and road construction was stopped while a steep foot and [[Packhorse|pack horse]] track was constructed over the hill between the port and the Heathcote valley, where access to the site of the proposed settlement could be gained. This track became known as the [[Bridle Path (New Zealand)|Bridle Path]], because the path was so steep that pack horses needed to be led by the bridle.<ref>''Rescue, the Sumner community and its lifeboat service'' – Amodeo, Colin (editor), Christchurch: Sumner Lifeboat Institution Incorporated, 1998</ref>

Goods that were too heavy or bulky to be transported by pack horse over the Bridle Path were shipped by small sailing vessels some eight miles (13&nbsp;km) by water around the coast and up the [[Avon Heathcote Estuary]] to [[Ferrymead]]. New Zealand's first public railway line, the [[Ferrymead Railway]], opened from Ferrymead to Christchurch in 1863. Due to the difficulties in travelling over the [[Port Hills]] and the dangers associated with shipping navigating the Sumner bar, a [[Lyttelton Rail Tunnel|railway tunnel]] was built through the Port Hills to Lyttelton, opening in 1867.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/lyttelton-road-tunnel/ |title=Chch City Libraries |publisher=my.christchurchcitylibraries.com |date=26 January 2010 |accessdate=5 March 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150402134130/http://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/lyttelton-road-tunnel/ |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Christchurch became a city by [[royal charter]] on 31 July 1856, the first in New Zealand. Many of the city's [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] buildings by architect [[Benjamin Mountfort]] date from this period. Christchurch was the seat of provincial administration for the [[Canterbury Province|Province of Canterbury]], which was abolished in 1876. Christchurch buildings were damaged by earthquakes in [[1869 Christchurch earthquake|1869]], [[1881 Castle Hill earthquake |1881]] and [[1888 North Canterbury earthquake|1888]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/christchurch-and-canterbury-earthquakes/|title=Christchurch and Canterbury earthquakes|website=my.christchurchcitylibraries.com|language=en-NZ|access-date=23 December 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181223121335/https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/christchurch-and-canterbury-earthquakes/ |archive-date=23 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The city experienced rapid growth following the earthquakes. A Christchurch Central Recovery Plan guides rebuilding in the central city. There has been massive growth in the residential sector, with around 50,000 new houses expected to be constructed in the Greater Christchurch area by 2028 as outlined in the Land Use Recovery Plan (LURP).

==Geography==
[[File:Christchurch, New Zealand, NASA 2.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite image showing Christchurch and surrounding areas.]]
[[File:STS-116 spacewalk 1.jpg|thumb|View of the Christchurch region from the [[International Space Station]].]]
Christchurch lies in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], near the centre of the east coast of the [[South Island]], east of the [[Canterbury Plains]]. It is located near the southern end of [[Pegasus Bay]], and is bounded to the east by the Pacific Ocean coast and the [[Avon Heathcote Estuary|estuary]] of the [[Avon River (Canterbury)|Avon]] and [[Heathcote River]]s. To the south and south-east the urban portion of the city is limited by the volcanic slopes of the [[Port Hills]] separating it from Banks Peninsula. To the north the city is bounded by the braided [[Waimakariri River]].

Christchurch is one of a group of only four current cities in the world to have been carefully planned following the same layout of a central city square, four complementing city squares surrounding it and a parklands area that embrace the city centre. The first city built with this pattern was [[Philadelphia]]. Later came [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and [[Adelaide]], before Christchurch.<ref>{{cite book|title=Adelaide|first=Kerryn|last=Goldsworthy|year=2011|publisher=NewSouth|isbn=9-7817-4224092-3|pages=83}}</ref>

At the city's centre is [[Cathedral Square, Christchurch|Cathedral Square]], surrounding the now-earthquake-damaged – landmark [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] cathedral, [[ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch|Christ Church]]. The area around this square and within the Four Avenues of Christchurch (Bealey Avenue, Fitzgerald Avenue, Moorhouse Avenue and Deans Avenue<ref>{{cite web |url=http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/ResidentialDevelopment-OccupiedDwellings-docs.pdf |title=Christchurch City Council definition |accessdate=4 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901090511/http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/ResidentialDevelopment-OccupiedDwellings-docs.pdf |archivedate=1 September 2013  }}</ref>) is considered to be the central business district (CBD) of the city. The central city also has a number of residential areas, including Inner City East, Inner City West, Avon Loop, Moa Neighbourhood and Victoria, but many of the residential buildings in the CBD were demolished following the February 2011 earthquakes. Cathedral Square is located at the crossing of two major central streets, [[Colombo Street]] and Worcester Street.

The central city also includes the pedestrianised sections of Cashel and High streets commonly known pre-earthquakes as 'City Mall'. Refurbished in 2008/09 the mall featured especially designed seating, flower and garden boxes, more trees, paving, and an extension to the central city tram route. The tram route extension was nearly complete when the February 2011 earthquake struck. Following the earthquakes, most buildings in Cashel Mall were demolished. A shopping area called [[Re:START]] opened on Cashel Street adjacent to Ballantyne's Department Store in October 2011. The Re:START mall was made of colourful shipping containers that were converted to house retail stores. The [[Bridge of Remembrance]] commemorating war dead stands at the western end of the mall, was repaired rededicated on Anzac Day, Monday 25 April 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/bridge-of-remembrance/ |title=The Bridge of Remembrance Christchurch city libraries |accessdate=6 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906135554/https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/bridge-of-remembrance/ |archive-date=6 September 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/cityleisure/artsculture/artinthecity/statues/thebridgeofremembrance.aspx |title=The Bridge of Remembrance |work=ccc.govt.nz |accessdate=31 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204174406/http://www.ccc.govt.nz/cityleisure/artsculture/artinthecity/statues/thebridgeofremembrance.aspx |archivedate=4 February 2015  }}</ref>

The majority of the activities were free and a printable map was provided. There areas are slowly being reopened follow earthquake repair and strengthening work.

In 2010, the Christchurch City Council released "A City For People Action Plan", a programme of work through to 2022 to improve public spaces within the central city to entice more inner city residents and visitors. A primary action was to reduce the impact of motorised private vehicles and increase the comfort of pedestrians and cyclists. The plan was based on a report prepared for the council by renowned Danish design firm [[Gehl Architects]]. Since the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]], Wellington architect [[Ian Athfield]] has been selected to re-plan, although many varied suggestions have been promoted for rebuilding the central city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rebuildchristchurch.co.nz/architects-begin-to-look-at-rebuild-of-christchurch |date=1 March 2011 |title=Architects begin to look at rebuild of Christchurch |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303142238/http://rebuildchristchurch.co.nz/architects-begin-to-look-at-rebuild-of-christchurch |archivedate=3 March 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liturgy.co.nz/blog/rebuilding-christchurch/5323 |title=Rebuilding Christchurch |accessdate=26 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327060709/http://www.liturgy.co.nz/blog/rebuilding-christchurch/5323 |archive-date=27 March 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nzwood.co.nz/industry-news/2010/09/21/rebuilding-christchurch-with-wood-is-a-%E2%80%98new-zealand-solution%E2%80%99/ |title=Rebuilding Christchurch with wood is a 'New Zealand solution' |access-date=26 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613113728/http://nzwood.co.nz/industry-news/2010/09/21/rebuilding-christchurch-with-wood-is-a-%e2%80%98new-zealand-solution%e2%80%99/ |archive-date=13 June 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elevatedgardencity.com/ |title=Elevated Garden City rebuilding our beloved Christchurch for the 21st century |access-date=26 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323110729/http://www.elevatedgardencity.com/ |archive-date=23 March 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Demographics==
[[File:AntiguaBoatShedsChristchurch gobeirne.jpg|thumb|Boatsheds on the Avon River]]

The area administered by the Christchurch City Council has a population of {{NZ population data 2018|Christchurch city|y|y|y|(|),}} making it the second-largest in New Zealand, and the largest city in the [[South Island]].

The Christchurch [[Urban areas of New Zealand|urban area]] at {{NZ population data 2018|Christchurch|y}} is the second-largest in the country by population, after [[Auckland]]. The urban area differs from the city by excluding most of the Banks Peninsula.

The following table shows the ethnic profile of Christchurch's population, as recorded in the censuses held between [[2001 New Zealand census|2001]] and [[2018 New Zealand census|2018]]. The percentages add up to more than 100%, as some people counted themselves as belonging to more than one ethnic group. Figures for 2006 refer to just Christchurch City, not the whole urban area. The substantial percentage drop in the numbers of 'Europeans' in that census was mainly caused by the increasing numbers of people from this group choosing to define themselves as 'New Zealanders'–even though this was not one of the groups listed on the census form.

Other agribusinesses in Christchurch have included malting, seed development and dressing, wool and meat processing, and small biotechnology operations using by-products from meat works.<ref name="agriculture"/> Dairying has grown strongly in the surrounding areas with high world prices for milk products and the use of irrigation to lift grass growth on dry land. With its higher labour use this has helped stop declines in rural population. Many cropping and sheep farms have been converted to dairying. Conversions have been by agribusiness companies as well as by farmers, many of whom have moved south from North Island dairying strongholds such as [[Taranaki]] and the [[Waikato]].

Cropping has always been important in the surrounding countryside. Wheat and barley and various strains of clover and other grasses for seed exporting have been the main crops. These have all created processing businesses in Christchurch. In recent years, regional agriculture has diversified, with a thriving wine industry springing up at [[Waipara]], and beginnings of new horticulture industries such as olive production and processing. Deer farming has led to new processing using antlers for Asian medicine and aphrodisiacs. The high quality local wine in particular has increased the appeal of Canterbury and Christchurch to tourists.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Guide|title=Christchurch Wineries, Wine Tasting & Vineyards New Zealand|url=http://www.tourism.net.nz/region/christchurch/attractions-and-activities/wineries|website=www.tourism.net.nz|publisher=New Zealand Tourism Guide|accessdate=15 August 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816005258/http://www.tourism.net.nz/region/christchurch/attractions-and-activities/wineries|archive-date=16 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Industry===
Christchurch is the second largest manufacturing centre in New Zealand behind [[Auckland]], the sector being the second largest contributor to the local economy,<ref>{{cite web|title=Manufacturing Jobs in Christchurch|url=http://www.cdc.org.nz/christchurch/manufacturing-jobs/|website=CDC|accessdate=9 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330130856/http://www.cdc.org.nz/christchurch/manufacturing-jobs/|archive-date=30 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> with firms such as Anderson's making steel work for bridges, tunnels, and hydro-electric dams in the early days of infrastructure work. Now manufacturing is mainly of light products and the key market is Australia, with firms such as those pioneered by the Stewart family among the larger employers. Before clothing manufacture largely moved to Asia, Christchurch was the centre of the New Zealand clothing industry, with firms such as LWR Industries. The firms that remain mostly design and market, and manufacture in Asia. The city also had five footwear manufacturers, but these have been replaced by imports.

In the last few decades, technology-based industries have sprung up in Christchurch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/opinion/will-tech-companies-stay-committed-christchurch-roll-call|title=Will tech companies stay committed to Christchurch? A roll call|date=28 February 2011|access-date=15 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611063309/http://www.nbr.co.nz/opinion/will-tech-companies-stay-committed-christchurch-roll-call|archive-date=11 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Angus Tait]] founded [[Tait Communications|Tait Electronics]], a mobile-radio manufacturer, and other firms spun off from this, such as Dennis Chapman's Swichtec. In software, Cantabrian [[Gil Simpson]] founded a company that made [[LINC 4GL|LINC]] and [[JADE (programming language)|Jade]] programming languages and a [[management buyout]] spawned local firm ''Wynyard Group''.

There have also been spin-offs from the electrical department of the University of Canterbury engineering school. These included Pulse Data, which became Human Ware (making reading devices and computers for blind people and those with limited vision) and CES Communications (encryption). The Pulse Data founders had moved from the Canterbury University engineering school to work for Wormald Inc. when they set up Pulse Data through a [[Management buyout]] of their division.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In recent times, the [[University of Canterbury]] engineering school and computer science department play an important role in supplying staff and research for the technology industries, and the [[Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology]] provides a flow of trained technicians and engineers. Locally and nationally, the IT sector is known not for its size (the third largest in New Zealand) but for producing innovative and entrepreneurial solutions, products and concepts.<ref>{{cite web|title=IT Jobs in Christchurch|url=http://www.cdc.org.nz/christchurch/it-jobs/|accessdate=9 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330120759/http://www.cdc.org.nz/christchurch/it-jobs/|archive-date=30 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Tourism===
[[Tourism in New Zealand|Tourism]] is also a significant factor of the local economy. The close proximity of the [[Ski resort|ski field]]s and other attractions of the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]], and hotels, a casino, and an airport that meet international standards make Christchurch a stopover destination for many tourists. The city is popular with Japanese tourists,<ref>[http://www.christchurch.org.nz/SisterCities/Kurashiki/ The Sister City link with Christchurch] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704180926/http://www.christchurch.org.nz/SisterCities/Kurashiki/ |date=4 July 2007 }} (from christchurch.org, a [[Christchurch City Council]] website)</ref> with signage around Cathedral Square in Japanese.

===Gateway to the Antarctic===

====Antarctic exploration====<!-- the article [[Scott Statue]] links to this section; if you change the heading here, please adjust the link in that article -->
Christchurch has a history of involvement in [[History of Antarctica|Antarctic exploration]] – both [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and [[Ernest Shackleton]] used the port of [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]] as a departure point for expeditions, and in the central city there is a [[Scott Statue|statue of Scott]] sculpted by his widow, [[Kathleen Scott]]. Within the city, the [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch|Canterbury Museum]] preserves and exhibits many historic artefacts and stories of Antarctic exploration.

The [[International Antarctic Centre]] provides both base facilities and a museum and visitor centre focused upon current Antarctic activities. The United States Navy and United States Air National Guard, augmented by the New Zealand and Australian air forces, use Christchurch Airport as the take-off point for the main supply route to [[McMurdo Station|McMurdo]] and [[Scott Base]]s in Antarctica. The Clothing Distribution Center in Christchurch had more than 140,000 pieces of extreme cold weather gear for issue to nearly 2,000 [[US Antarctic Program]] participants in the 2007–08 season.<ref Name="SUN">{{cite web |title =Looking good in the Antarctic |work =Clothing Distribution Center in Christchurch, New Zealand, outfits USAP participants for the trip south |publisher =The Antarctic Sun |date =10 January 2008 |url =http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contentHandler.cfm?id=1309 |accessdate =13 January 2008 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110910162658/http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contentHandler.cfm?id=1309 |archive-date =10 September 2011 |url-status =live }}</ref>

==Transport==
{{See also|Public transport in Christchurch}}
Christchurch is served by [[Christchurch Airport]] and by buses (local and long-distance) and trains. The local bus service, known as [[Public transport in Christchurch|Metro]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metroinfo.org.nz/ |title=Metro |publisher=Metroinfo.org.nz |accessdate=4 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722161247/http://www.metroinfo.org.nz/ |archive-date=22 July 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> is provided by [[Environment Canterbury]]. The car, however, remains the dominant form of transport in the city, as with the rest of New Zealand.

Christchurch has over 2,300&nbsp;km of roads, of this 360&nbsp;km is unpaved and 26&nbsp;km is motorway.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ccc.govt.nz/assets/Documents/The-Council/Plans-Strategies-Policies-Bylaws/Plans/annual-plan/InfrastructureStrategy2015-2045.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202083013/http://ccc.govt.nz/assets/Documents/The-Council/Plans-Strategies-Policies-Bylaws/Plans/annual-plan/InfrastructureStrategy2015-2045.pdf |archive-date=2 February 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Christchurch has three motorways consisting of the [[Christchurch Northern Motorway]] (includes the [[Western Belfast Bypass]]), [[Christchurch Southern Motorway]] and the [[Christchurch-Lyttelton Motorway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nzta.govt.nz/projects/christchurch-motorways/christchurch-northern-corridor/faqs/#6|title=Frequently asked questions &#124; NZ Transport Agency|website=www.nzta.govt.nz|access-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721073436/https://www.nzta.govt.nz/projects/christchurch-motorways/christchurch-northern-corridor/faqs/#6|archive-date=21 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nzta.govt.nz/projects/christchurch-motorways/christchurch-southern-corridor/christchurch-southern-motorway-stage-2/project-details/|title=Project details &#124; NZ Transport Agency|website=www.nzta.govt.nz|access-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721073250/https://www.nzta.govt.nz/projects/christchurch-motorways/christchurch-southern-corridor/christchurch-southern-motorway-stage-2/project-details/|archive-date=21 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Christchurch has an extensive bus network with bus routes serving most areas of the city and satellite towns. Nearly all bus routes travelled through the central city Bus Exchange before the earthquake but due to reduced passenger numbers since the earthquakes, especially in the central city, the bus network was reorganised to direct more localised services to 'hubs', such as major shopping centres, where they connect to the central station via core bus routes. Before the 2011 earthquakes, in addition to normal bus services, Christchurch also had a pioneering [[zero-fare]] [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] bus service, the ''Shuttle'', in the inner city. The service has been suspended following the earthquakes and it is unclear whether it will resume again in the future.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/63113622/city-congestion-demands-action |title=City congestion demands action |publisher=The Press |date=12 November 2014 |accessdate=3 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513141834/http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/63113622/City-congestion-demands-action |archive-date=13 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Bus services are also available leaving Christchurch, daily passenger bus services<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knightrider.co.nz/|title=Christchurch To Dunedin Bus – Knight Rider|work=knightrider.co.nz|access-date=11 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113055159/http://www.knightrider.co.nz/|archive-date=13 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> operates between Dunedin and Christchurch on the State Highway 1.

Historically, Christchurch has been known as New Zealand's cycling city<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.janesoceania.com/newzealand_christchurch2/index.htm |title=About Christchurch: The Town Imagined, Victorian City 1877 – 1902 |publisher=Janesoceania.com |date=2 May 2011 |accessdate=4 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715150442/http://www.janesoceania.com/newzealand_christchurch2/index.htm |archive-date=15 July 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> and currently still attracts about 7% of commuters cycling. The central city has very flat terrain and the Christchurch City Council has established a network of cycle lanes and paths, such as the [[Christchurch Railway Cycleway|Railway Cycleway]]. Post-quake public consultation on rebuilding the city expressed a strong desire for a more sustainable transport system, particularly greater use of cycling again, and this has been reflected in the Council's strategic transport plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/thecouncil/policiesreportsstrategies/transportplan/index.aspx |title=Christchurch Transport Strategic Plan 2012–42 |publisher=Ccc.govt.nz |date=3 May 2013 |accessdate=4 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106162337/http://www.ccc.govt.nz/thecouncil/policiesreportsstrategies/transportplan/index.aspx |archivedate=6 November 2013  }}</ref> [[File:01 Christchurch 178 Brill car.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Christchurch Brill Tram No 178 on the heritage tramway in inner-city Christchurch.]] The Christchurch City Council has committed NZ$68.5&nbsp;million to build a network of modern cycleways over the next five years.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

There is a functioning [[Christchurch tramway system|tramway system]] in Christchurch, but as a tourist attraction; its loop is restricted to a circuit of the central city. The trams were originally introduced in 1905 as a form of public transport, and ceased operating in 1954,<ref name="IPENZTG">''A Wheel on Each Corner'', The History of the IPENZ Transportation Group 1956–2006 – Douglass, Malcolm; [[IPENZ]] Transportation Group, 2006, Page 12</ref> but returned to the inner city (as a tourist attraction) in 1995. However, following the February 2011 earthquake, the system was damaged and within the cordoned off 'Red Zone' of the central city. The tramway reopened in November 2013 on a limited route, with plans to extend the tram route in 2014, first to reopen the complete pre-earthquake circuit, and then to open the extension travelling through the Re:Start Mall and High Street, which was being constructed when the 2011 earthquake struck.

There is a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] system called the [[Christchurch Gondola]] which operates as a tourist attraction, providing transport from the [[Heathcote Valley]] to the top of [[Mount Cavendish]] in the city's south-east.

Rail services, both long-distance and commuter, used to focus on the former railway station on Moorhouse avenue. Commuter trains were progressively cancelled in the 1960s and 1970s. The last such service, between Christchurch and [[Rangiora]], ceased in 1976. After the reduction in services a new [[Christchurch railway station (New Zealand)|Christchurch railway station]] was established at Addington Junction. The [[Main North Line, New Zealand|Main North Line]] railway travels northwards via [[Kaikoura]] to [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]] and is served by the [[Coastal Pacific]] passenger train, while the [[Main South Line]] heads to [[Invercargill]] via [[Dunedin]] and was used by the [[Southerner (New Zealand train)|Southerner]] until its cancellation in 2002. The most famous train to depart Christchurch is the [[TranzAlpine]], which travels along the Main South Line to [[Rolleston, New Zealand|Rolleston]] and then turns onto the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]], passes through the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] via the [[Otira Tunnel]], and terminates in [[Greymouth]] on the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]]. This trip is often regarded as one of the ten great train journeys in the world for the amazing scenery through which it passes. The TranzAlpine service is primarily a tourist service and carries no significant commuter traffic.

[[Christchurch Airport]] is located in Harewood, {{convert|12|km|mi}} to the northwest of the city centre. The airport serves as the major base for the New Zealand, Italian and [[United States Antarctic Program|United States Antarctic]] programs.

Christchurch is a distinctly English city, however it contains various European elements, with strong [[Gothic Revival architecture]]. As early settlers of New Zealand, [[Māori culture]] is also prevalent in the city. It features many public open spaces and parks, river beds and cafés and restaurants situated in the city centre and surrounding suburbs.

===Cinema===
While historically most cinemas were grouped around Cathedral Square,<ref>[http://www.canterburyfilmsociety.org.nz/localcinemas/regent.html Regent Theatre] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010333/http://www.canterburyfilmsociety.org.nz/localcinemas/regent.html |date=28 September 2007 }} <nowiki>[1930–1976]</nowiki> (from the Canterbury Film Society website)</ref> only two cinemas remain there. The Regent complex was rebuilt as 'Regent on Worcester' in 1996. In 2009 Metro Cinemas opened in Worcester Street with three screens.

The Rialto Cinemas on Moorhouse avenue specialised in international films and art house productions. The Rialto also hosted the majority of the city's various film festivals and was home to the local film society. The Rialto was closed following the February 2011 earthquake.

The [[Christchurch Arts Centre]] includes two art house cinemas, Cloisters and The Academy, screening a wide selection of contemporary, classic and foreign language films.

==Utilities==
===Electricity===
The Christchurch City Council established the city's first public electricity supply in 1903, and the city was connected to [[Coleridge Power Station]] in 1914. Up until 1989, electricity distribution and retailing in Christchurch was the responsibility of four entities: the Christchurch City Council Municipal Electricity Department (MED), Riccarton Electricity, the Port Hills Energy Authority, and the Central Canterbury Electric Power Board. In 1989, all four companies entered a joint venture, named Southpower. The 1998 electricity sector reforms required all electricity companies to separate their distribution and retailing businesses. Southpower retained its distribution business and sold its retail business to [[Meridian Energy]]. In December 1998, the lines business was renamed [[Orion New Zealand Limited|Orion New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.oriongroup.co.nz/company-profile/company-history.aspx| title=Company history| publisher=Orion New Zealand Limited| access-date=4 May 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621065023/http://www.oriongroup.co.nz/company-profile/company-history.aspx| archive-date=21 June 2015| url-status=dead}}</ref> Today, Orion owns and operates the local distribution network servicing the city, with electricity fed into it from two [[Transpower New Zealand Limited|Transpower]] substations at Islington and Bromley.

The electricity distribution network in Christchurch suffered significant damage in the 2011 earthquakes, especially in the northeast where the 66,000-volt subtransmission cables supplying the area were damaged beyond repair.<ref>{{cite web|title=Power transformer to be installed in eastern Chch suburbs|url=http://tvnz.co.nz//national-news/power-transformer-installed-in-eastern-chch-suburbs-4042662|website=Newstalk ZB|publisher=TVNZ|accessdate=17 December 2017|date=4 March 2011|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.li/20110304154432/http://tvnz.co.nz//national-news/power-transformer-installed-in-eastern-chch-suburbs-4042662|archivedate=4 March 2011}}</ref> This necessitated major repairs to the existing infrastructure, as well as building new infrastructure to supply new housing developments.

At the 2013 census, 94.0% of Christchurch homes were heated wholly or partly by electricity, the highest in the country.<ref>{{cite web |title= 2013 Census QuickStats about housing – data tables |url= http://archive.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Census/2013%20Census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-about-housing/quickstats-housing-tables.xlsx |publisher= Statistics New Zealand |date= 18 March 2014 |accessdate= 21 October 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190129053929/http://archive.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/Census/2013%20Census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-about-housing/quickstats-housing-tables.xlsx |archive-date= 29 January 2019 |url-status= live }}</ref>
