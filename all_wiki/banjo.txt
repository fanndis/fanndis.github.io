The '''banjo''' is a stringed instrument with a thin membrane stretched over a frame or cavity to form a resonator. The membrane is typically circular, and usually made of plastic, or occasionally animal skin. Early forms of the instrument were fashioned by African-Americans in the United States, adapted from African instruments of similar design.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibma.org/about.bluegrass/history/index.asp |title=Bluegrass Music: The Roots |publisher=[[International Bluegrass Music Association|IBMA]] |access-date=25 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822015618/http://www.ibma.org/about.bluegrass/history/index.asp |archive-date=22 August 2006<!-- disappears after 30 April 2011-->}}</ref><ref name=grove>{{cite web|last1=Odell|first1=Jay Scott|title=Banjo |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2256043|website=Grove Music Online.

===Early origins===
[[File:SlaveDanceand Music.jpg|thumb|''[[The Old Plantation]]'', ca. 1785 – 1795, the earliest known American painting to picture a banjo-like instrument; thought to depict a plantation in [[Beaufort County, South Carolina]]]]
[[File:Surinamese Creole, c 1770-1777.png|thumb|The oldest known banjo, c. 1770-1777, from the Surinamese Creole culture.]]

The modern banjo derives from instruments that are thought to have been in use in the [[Caribbean]] since the 17th century by enslaved people taken from West Africa. Written references to the banjo in North America appear in the 18th century, and the instrument became increasingly available commercially from around the second quarter of the 19th century.<ref name=grove/> Since many enslaved people of South America were brought there by the Portuguese, they might have brought the idea of the instrument with them.

Several claims as to the [[etymology]] of the name "banjo" have been made. It may derive from the [[Kimbundu]] word ''mbanza'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebanjoguru.com/music/276-how-did-banjos-get-their-name/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227071335/http://www.thebanjoguru.com/music/276-how-did-banjos-get-their-name/ |archive-date=27 December 2010  |url-status=dead }}</ref> which is an African string instrument modeled after the Portuguese ''banza'': a ''[[vihuela]]'' with five two-string courses and a further two short strings.  The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] states that it comes from a [[dialect]]al pronunciation of Portuguese ''[[bandora (instrument)|bandore]]'' or from an early anglicisation of Spanish ''[[bandurria]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/15231?redirectedFrom=banjo&|title=Banjo|website=Oxford English Dictionary|access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref>

Various instruments in Africa, chief among them the [[Kora (instrument)|''kora'']], feature a skin [[Drumhead|head]] and [[gourd]] (or similar shell) body.<ref name="myspace.com">Pestcoe, Shlomoe and Adams, Greg C., ''Banjo Roots Research: Exploring the Banjo's African American Origins & West African Heritage'', 2010</ref><ref>[https://archive.today/20121229072104/http://www.myspace.com/banjoroots/blog]</ref> The African instruments differ from early African American banjos in that the necks do not possess a Western-style fingerboard and tuning pegs, instead having stick necks, with strings attached to the neck with loops for tuning.<ref name="myspace.com" /> Banjos with fingerboards and tuning pegs are known from the Caribbean as early as the 17th century.<ref name="myspace.com" /> Some 18th- and early 19th-century writers transcribed the name of these instruments variously as ''bangie'', ''banza'', ''bonjaw'',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Cynric R.|title=Hamel, the Obeah Man|date=1827|publisher=Hunt and Clarke|location=London|page=17|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/stream/hamelobeahman00hamegoog#page/n26/mode/2up|access-date=7 February 2016}}</ref> ''banjer''<ref>Entertainment at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]] featuring stage character, 'The Negro and his Banjer':The Times (London), 5 October 1790, p.1</ref> and ''banjar''. Instruments similar to the banjo (e.g., the Chinese ''[[sanxian]],'' the Japanese ''[[shamisen]]'', Persian ''[[Tar (lute)|tar]]'', and Moroccan ''[[sintir]]'') have been played in many countries. Another likely relative of the banjo is the ''[[akonting]]'', a spike folk lute played by the [[Jola people|Jola tribe]] of [[Senegambia Confederation|Senegambia]], and the ''ubaw-akwala'' of the [[Ibo people|Igbo]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Murder at Montpelier: Ibo Africans in Virginia |first=Douglas B. |last=Chambers |publisher=Univ.

Early, African-influenced banjos were built around a [[gourd]] body and a wooden stick neck. These instruments had varying numbers of strings, though often including some form of drone. The earliest known picture, ca. 1785–1795, of an enslaved person playing a banjo-like instrument ([[The Old Plantation]]) shows a four-string instrument with its fourth (thumb) string shorter than the others.

===Classic era, 1880s-1910s===
The term ''classic banjo'' is used today to talk about a bare-finger "guitar style" that was widely in use among banjo players of the late 19th to early 20th century.<ref name=banjoent1>{{cite book |last=Schreyer |first=Lowell H. |date=2007 |title=The Banjo Entertainers |location= Mankato, Minnesota|publisher=Minnesota Heritage Publishing |page=232 }}</ref> It is still used by banjoists today. The term also differentiates that style of playing from the fingerpicking bluegrass banjo styles, such as the [[Scruggs style]] and [[Keith style]].<ref name=banjoent1/>

The ''Briggs Banjo Method'', considered to be the first banjo method and which taught the ''stroke style'' of playing, also mentioned the existence of another way of playing, the ''guitar style.''<ref name=Stewart1/><ref name=banjoent3>{{cite book |last=Schreyer |first=Lowell H. |date=2007 |title=The Banjo Entertainers |location= Mankato, Minnesota|publisher=Minnesota Heritage Publishing |page=151, 170 }}</ref> Alternatively known as "finger style", the new way of playing the banjo displaced the stroke method, until by 1870 it was the dominant style.<ref name=RTB3>{{cite book |last=Webb |first=Robert Lloyd |date=1984 |title= Ring the Banjar! The Banjo in America from Folklore to Factory |location= Anaheim Hills, California|publisher=Centerstream Publishing |page=13 }}</ref> Although mentioned by Briggs, it wasn't taught.

To play in guitar style, players use the thumb and two or three fingers on their right hand to pick the notes. Samuel Swaim Stewart summarized the style in 1888, saying,
 "In the guitar style of Banjo-playing...the little finger of the right hand is rested upon the head near the bridge...[and] serves as a rest to the hand and a resistance to the movement of picking the strings...In the beginning it is best to acquire a knowledge of picking the strings with the use of the first and second fingers and thumb only, allowing the third finger to remain idle until the other fingers have become thoroughly accustomed to their work...the three fingers are almost invariably used in playing chords and accompaniments to songs."<ref name=Stewart1>{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Samuel Swaim |date=1888 |title=The Banjo! A Dissertation|location= Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|publisher=S. S. Stewart |pages=43–45 }}</ref>

The banjo, although popular, carried low-class associations from its role in blackface minstrel shows, medicine shows, tent shows, and variety shows or vaudeville.<ref name=olive1>{{cite thesis |last=Peters |first=Sean |title= An Olive Branch in Appalachia: The Integration of the Banjo into 19th Century American Folk Music |url= https://twu.edu/media/documents/history-government/An-Olive-Branch-in-Appalachia-Ibid.-Volume-7-Spring-2014.pdf|pages= 104, 105|access-date=28 March 2020|quote=In America it has always been seen as an instrument of the lower class...}}</ref> There was a push in the 19th century banjo to bring the instrument into "respectability."<ref name=olive1/> Musicians such as [[William  A.

As the "raucous" imitations of plantation life decreased in minstrelsy, the banjo became more acceptable as an instrument of fashionable society, even to be accepted into women's parlors.<ref name=RTB6/><ref name=banjoent13>{{cite book |last=Schreyer |first=Lowell H. |date=2007 |title=The Banjo Entertainers |location= Mankato, Minnesota|publisher=Minnesota Heritage Publishing |page=152, 230 }}</ref> Part of that change was a switch from the stroke style to the guitar playing style.<ref name=RTB6/><ref name=banjoent13/><ref name=RTB4/> An 1888 newspaper said, "All the maidens and a good many of the women also strum the instrument, banjo classes abound on every side and banjo recitals are among the newest diversions of fashion...Youths and elderly men too have caught the fever...the star strummers among men are in demand at the smartest parties and have the choosing of the society of the most charming girls."<ref name=banjoent9>{{cite book |last=Schreyer |first=Lowell H. |date=2007 |title=The Banjo Entertainers |location= Mankato, Minnesota|publisher=Minnesota Heritage Publishing |page=163 }}</ref>

Some of those entertainers, such as Alfred A. Farland, specialized in classical music. However, musicians who wanted to entertain their audiences, and make a living, mixed it in with the popular music that audiences wanted.<ref name=banjoent10>{{cite book |last=Schreyer |first=Lowell H. |date=2007 |title=The Banjo Entertainers |location= Mankato, Minnesota|publisher=Minnesota Heritage Publishing |page=175 }}</ref> Farland's pupil Frederick J. Bacon was one of these. A former medicine show entertainer, Bacon performed classical music along with popular songs such as ''Massa's in de cold, cold ground'', a ''Medley of Scotch Airs'', a ''Medley of Southern Airs'', and his own ''West Lawn Polka''.

Banjo innovation which began in the minstrel age continued, with increased use of metal parts, exotic wood, raised metal frets and a tone-ring that improved the sound.<ref name=museumsign>{{Cite sign |title=The Classic Era |year=n.d. |type=Sign inside museum |publisher= American Banjo Museum |location=[[Oklahoma City]]}}</ref> Instruments were designed in a variety of sizes and pitch ranges, to play different parts in banjo orchestras.<ref name=museumsign/> Examples on display in the museum include [[banjorine]]s and piccolo banjos.

New styles of playing, a new look, instruments in a variety of pitch ranges to take the place of different sections in an orchestra – all helped to separate the instrument from the rough minstrel image of the previous 50–60 years.<ref name=museumsign/> The instrument was modern now, a bright new thing, with polished metal sides.<ref name=museumsign/>

===Ragtime era (1895–1919) and Jazz Age era (1910s–1930s)===
{{Listen|filename=Tom Turpin - Vess L. Ossman - The Buffalo Rag.ogg|title=The Buffalo Rag|description=[[Tom Turpin]]'s 1904 composition ''The Buffalo Rag'', in a 1906 performance by [[Vess Ossman]].

In the early 1900s, new banjos began to spread, four-string models, played with a plectrum rather than with the minstrel-banjo clawhammer stroke or the classic-banjo fingerpicking style. The new banjos were a result of changing musical tastes. New music spurred the creation of "evolutionary variations" of the banjo, from the five-string model current since the 1830s to newer four-string [[Banjo#Plectrum banjo|plectrum]] and [[Banjo#Tenor banjo|tenor banjos]].<ref name=mushistpage>{{cite web |url= http://www.banjomuseum.org:80/banjohistory.htm |title= Banjo History |author= <!--Not stated--> |publisher= The National Four-String Banjo Hall of Fame Museum |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080520074724/http://www.banjomuseum.org/banjohistory.htm |archive-date= 20 May 2008 |url-status= live }}</ref>

The instruments became ornately decorated in the [[Roaring Twenties|1920s]] to be visually dynamic to a theater audience.<ref name=mushistpage/> The instruments were increasingly modified or made in a new style – necks that were shortened to handle the four steel (not fiber as before) strings, strings that were sounded with a pick instead of fingers, four strings instead of five and tuned differently.<ref name=mushistpage/> The changes reflected the nature of post World War 1 music.<ref name=mushistpage/> The country was turning away from European classics, preferring the "upbeat and carefree feel" of jazz, and American soldiers returning from the war helped to drive this change.<ref name=mushistpage/> 

The change in tastes toward dance music and the need for louder instruments began a few years before the war, however, with ragtime.<ref name=mushistpage/> That music encouraged musicians to alter their 5-string banjos to four, add the louder steel strings and use a pick or plectrum, all in an effort to be heard over the brass and reed instruments that were current in dance-halls.<ref name=mushistpage/> The four string plectrum and tenor banjos did not eliminate the five-string variety. They were products of their times and musical purposes—ragtime and jazz dance music and theater music. 

The Great Depression is a visible line to mark the end of the [[Jazz Age]].<ref name=mushistpage/> The economic downturn cut into the sales of both four- and five-stringed banjos, and by World War 2, banjos were in sharp decline, the market for them dead.<ref name=2009Banjo2>{{cite web |url=  http://www.banjomuseum.org/banjohistory.htm |title= Banjo History |author=<!--Not stated--> |website= banjomuseum.org |publisher= American Banjo Museum |access-date= 10 February 2020|quote= The resulting catastrophic collapse of the stock market and Great Depression which followed marked the end of the jazz age – the final years in which the banjo held a place of prominence in American popular music.

In the post World War 2 years, the banjo experienced a resurgence, played by music stars such as [[Earl Scruggs]] (bluegrass), [[Bela Fleck]] (jazz, rock, world music), [[Gerry O'Connor (banjo player)|Gerry O'Connor]] (Celtic and Irish music), [[Perry Bechtel]] (jazz, big band), [[Pete Seeger]] (folk), and [[Otis Taylor (musician)|Otis Taylor]] (African-American roots, blues, jazz).<ref name=entrydisplay>{{cite AV media |title=Entry display at the American Banjo Museum |medium=motion picture, music, signs, 3-dimensional displays, posters, voiceover |location= Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|publisher= American Banjo Museum}}</ref>

Among these, Pete Seeger and Earl Scruggs were instrumental in turning the situation around.

Pete Seeger "was a major force behind a new national interest in folk music."<ref name=2009Banjo/> Learning to play a fingerstyle in the Appalachians from musicians who never stopped playing the banjo, he wrote the book, ''How To Play The Five-String Banjo'', which was the only banjo method on the market for years.<ref name=2009Banjo/> He was followed by a movement of folk musicians, such as [[Dave Guard]] of the [[Kingston Trio]] and [[Erik Darling]] of the [[The Weavers|Weavers]] and [[The Tarriers|Tarriers]].<ref name=2009Banjo/>

Earl Scruggs was seen both as a legend and a "contemporary musical innovator" who gave his name to his style of playing, the ''Scruggs Style''.<ref name=Scruggssign>{{Cite sign |title=Earl Scruggs....

New Traditions |year=n.d. |type=Sign inside museum |publisher= American Banjo Museum |location=[[Oklahoma City]]|quote= [This ref takes from three signs from the same area in the museum]}}</ref> Scruggs played the banjo "with heretofore unheard of speed and dexterity," using a picking technique for the 5-string banjo that he perfected from 2-finger and 3-finger picking techniques in rural North Carolina.<ref name=Scruggssign/> His playing reached Americans through the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and into the living rooms of Americans who didn't listen to country or bluegrass music, through the theme music of the [[Beverley Hillbillies]].<ref name=Scruggssign/> 

For the last one hundred years, the tenor banjo has become an intrinsic part of the world of Irish traditional music.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theirishplace.com/traditional-irish-music/the-irish-banjo/ |title=The Irish Banjo |access-date=7 February 2020}}</ref> It is a relative newcomer to the genre.

Two techniques closely associated with the five-string banjo are [[banjo roll|rolls]] and [[drone (music)|drones]]. Rolls are right hand [[accompaniment]]al fingering patterns that consist of eight (eighth) notes that [[subdivision (music)|subdivide]] each [[bar (music)|measure]].<ref name="Davis"/> Drone notes are quick little notes [typically eighth notes], usually played on the 5th (short) string to fill in around the melody notes [typically eighth notes].<ref name="Erbsen">Erbsen, Wayne (2004). ''Bluegrass Banjo for the Complete Ignoramus'', p.13. {{ISBN|1-883206-44-8}}.</ref> These techniques are both [[instrumental idiom|idiomatic]] to the banjo in all styles, and their sound is characteristic of bluegrass.

Historically, the banjo was played in the [[claw-hammer]] style by the Africans who brought their version of the banjo with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluegrassbanjo.org/banhist.html|title=History of the Banjo|website=Bluegrassbanjo.org|access-date=2 December 2016}}</ref> Several other styles of play were developed from this. Clawhammer consists of downward striking of one or more of the four main strings with the index, middle or both fingers while the drone or fifth string is played with a 'lifting' (as opposed to downward pluck) motion of the thumb. The notes typically sounded by the thumb in this fashion are, usually, on the off beat. Melodies can be quite intricate adding techniques such as double thumbing and drop thumb. In old time Appalachian Mountain music, a style called two-finger up-pick is also used, and a three-finger version that [[Earl Scruggs]] developed into the [[Scruggs style|"Scruggs" style]] picking was nationally aired in 1945 on the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.princetontraditional.org/Articles/Art1502.htm |publisher=Princeton Traditional Music Festival |title=Banjoes Rang Out |access-date=2 December 2016}}</ref>

While five-string banjos are traditionally played with either fingerpicks or the fingers themselves, [[Banjo#Tenor banjo|tenor banjo]]s and [[plectrum banjo]]s are played with a pick, either to strum full chords, or most commonly in [[Irish traditional music]], play single-note melodies.

== Modern forms ==
The modern banjo comes in a variety of forms, including four- and five-string versions. A six-string version, tuned and played similarly to a guitar, has gained popularity. In almost all of its forms, banjo playing is characterized by a fast [[arpeggiated]] plucking, though many different playing styles exist.

The body, or "pot", of a modern banjo typically consists of a circular rim (generally made of wood, though metal was also common on older banjos) and a tensioned head, similar to a drum head. Traditionally, the head was made from animal skin, but today is often made of various synthetic materials. Most modern banjos also have a metal "tone ring" assembly that helps further clarify and project the sound, but many older banjos do not include a tone ring.

The banjo is usually tuned with friction [[tuning peg]]s or [[planetary gear]] tuners, rather than the [[worm gear]] [[machine head]] used on guitars. Frets have become standard since the late 19th century, though fretless banjos are still manufactured and played by those wishing to execute [[glissando]], play quarter tones, or otherwise achieve the sound and feeling of early playing styles.

Modern banjos are typically strung with metal strings. Usually, the fourth string is [[Strings (music)#Winding|wound]] with either steel or bronze-phosphor alloy. Some players may string their banjos with nylon or gut strings to achieve a more mellow, old-time tone.

Some banjos have a separate resonator plate on the back of the pot to project the sound forward and give the instrument more volume. This type of banjo is usually used in bluegrass music, though resonator banjos are played by players of all styles, and are also used in old-time, sometimes as a substitute for electric amplification when playing in large venues.

Open-back banjos generally have a mellower tone and weigh less than resonator banjos. They usually have a different setup than a resonator banjo, often with a higher [[Action (music)|string action]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.promusicinternational.co.uk/ozark-2102g-5-string-open-back-banjo-2102g/dp/3108|title=Ozark 2102G 5-String Open Back Banjo : Pro Music International|website=Promusicinternational.co.uk|access-date=2 December 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203060339/http://www.promusicinternational.co.uk/ozark-2102g-5-string-open-back-banjo-2102g/dp/3108|archive-date=3 December 2016}}</ref>

=== Five-string banjo === <!-- This section is linked from redirect "[[Five-string banjo]]" -->
The modern five-string banjo is a variation on Sweeney's original design. The fifth string is usually the same gauge as the first, but starts from the fifth fret, three-quarters the length of the other strings. This lets the string be tuned to a higher open pitch than possible for the full-length strings. Because of the short fifth string, the five-string banjo uses a [[reentrant tuning]] – the string pitches do not proceed lowest to highest across the fingerboard. Instead, the fourth string is lowest, then third, second, first, and the fifth string is highest.

The short fifth string presents special problems for a [[capo]]. For small changes (going up or down one or two semitones, for example), retuning the fifth string simply is possible. Otherwise, various devices called "fifth-string capos" effectively shorten the vibrating part of the string. Many banjo players use model-railroad spikes or titanium spikes (usually installed at the seventh fret and sometimes at others), under which they hook the string to press it down on the [[fret]].

Five-string banjo players use many tunings. (Tunings are given in left-to-right order, as viewed from the front of the instrument with the neck pointing up.) Probably the most common, particularly in bluegrass, is the Open-G tuning G4 D3 G3 B3 D4. In earlier times, the tuning G4 C3 G3 B3 D4 was commonly used instead, and this is still the preferred tuning for some types of folk music and for [[classic banjo]]. Other tunings found in old-time music include double C (G4 C3 G3 C4 D4), "sawmill" (G4 D3 G3 C4 D4) also called "mountain modal" and open D (F#4D3 F#3 A3 D4). These tunings are often taken up a tone, either by tuning up or using a capo. For example, "double-D" tuning (A4 D3 A3 D4 E4) – commonly reached by tuning up from double C – is often played to accompany fiddle tunes in the key of D and Open-A (A4 E3 A3 C#4 E4) is usually used for playing tunes in the key of A. Dozens of other banjo tunings are used, mostly in old-time music. These tunings are used to make playing specific tunes easier, usually fiddle tunes or groups of fiddle tunes.

The size of the five-string banjo is largely standardized, but smaller and larger sizes exist, including the long-neck or "Seeger neck" variation designed by [[Pete Seeger]]. Petite variations on the five-string banjo have been available since the 1890s. S.S. Stewart introduced the [[banjeaurine]], tuned one fourth above a standard five-string. Piccolo banjos are smaller, and tuned one octave above a standard banjo. Between these sizes and standard lies the A-scale banjo, which is two frets shorter and usually tuned one full step above standard tunings. Many makers have produced banjos of other scale lengths, and with various innovations.

[[File:Don Wayne Reno playing the banjo with fingerpicks.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A five-string banjo]]

American [[old-time music]] typically uses the five-string, open-back banjo. It is played in a number of different styles, the most common being [[clawhammer]] or frailing, characterized by the use of a downward rather than upward stroke when striking the strings with a fingernail. Frailing techniques use the thumb to catch the fifth string for a [[drone (music)|drone]] after most [[strums]] or after each stroke ("double thumbing"), or to pick out additional melody notes in what is known as drop-thumb. Pete Seeger popularized a [[Folk music|folk]] style by combining clawhammer with up picking, usually without the use of [[fingerpick]]s. Another common style of old-time banjo playing is fingerpicking banjo or classic banjo. This style is based upon [[parlor-style guitar]].<ref name="Trischka">Trischka, Tony (1992). ''Banjo Songbook'', p.20. {{ISBN|0-8256-0197-5}}.</ref>

Bluegrass music, which uses the five-string resonator banjo almost exclusively, is played in several common styles. These include Scruggs style, named after Earl Scruggs; melodic, or [[Keith style]], named for [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]]; and three-finger style with single-string work, also called Reno style after [[Don Reno]]. In these styles, the emphasis is on arpeggiated figures played in a continuous eighth-note rhythm, known as [[banjo roll|rolls]]. All of these styles are typically played with fingerpicks.

The first five-string, electric, solid-body banjo was developed by [[Buck Trent|Charles Wilburn (Buck) Trent]], Harold "Shot" Jackson, and David Jackson in 1960.

The five-string banjo has been used in classical music since before the turn of the 20th century. [[contemporary classical music|Contemporary and modern]] works have been written or arranged for the instrument by [[Jerry Garcia]], Buck Trent, [[Béla Fleck]], [[Tony Trischka]], [[Ralph Stanley]], [[Steve Martin]], [[George Crumb]], [[Modest Mouse]], [[Jo Kondo]], [[Paul Elwood]], [[Hans Werner Henze]] (notably in his [[Symphony No. 6 (Henze)|''Sixth Symphony'']]), Daniel Mason of [[Hank Williams III]]'s Damn Band, [[Beck]], [[the Water Tower Bucket Boys]], [[Todd Taylor (banjo player)|Todd Taylor]], [[J.P. Pickens]], Peggy Honeywell, [[Norfolk & Western]], Putnam Smith, [[Iron & Wine]], [[The Avett Brothers]], [[The Well Pennies]], [[Punch Brothers]], [[Julian Koster]], and [[Sufjan Stevens]].

[[Frederick Delius]] wrote for a banjo in his opera ''[[Koanga]]''.

[[Ernst Krenek]] includes two banjos in his ''Kleine Symphonie'' (''Little Symphony'').

[[Kurt Weill]] has a banjo in his opera ''[[The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny]]''.

[[Viktor Ullmann]] included a tenor banjo part in his ''Piano Concerto'' (op. 25).

The four-string plectrum banjo is a standard banjo without the short drone string. It usually has 22 frets on the neck and a scale length of 26 to 28&nbsp;inches, and was originally tuned C3 G3 B3 D4. It can also be tuned like the top four strings of a guitar, which is known as "Chicago tuning".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Witt |first1=Lawrence |title=What is a Plectrum Banjo |url=https://blog.deeringbanjos.com/what-is-a-plectrum-banjo |website=Deering Banjos |publisher=Deering Banjos |access-date=15 October 2020}}</ref> As the name suggests, it is usually played with a guitar-style [[plectrum|pick]] (that is, a single one held between thumb and forefinger), unlike the five-string banjo, which is either played with a [[thumbpick]] and two fingerpicks, or with bare fingers. The plectrum banjo evolved out of the five-string banjo, to cater to styles of music involving strummed chords. The plectrum is also featured in many early jazz recordings and arrangements.

Four-string banjos can be used for chordal accompaniment (as in early jazz), for single-string melody playing (as in Irish traditional music), in "chord melody" style (a succession of chords in which the highest notes carry the melody), in tremolo style (both on chords and single strings), and a mixed technique called duo style that combines single-string tremolo and rhythm chords.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Waldrep |first1=Barry |title=Sweet Sounds of the Banjo: The History of the Banjo |url=https://banjo.com/sweet-sounds-of-the-banjo-the-history-of-the-banjo/ |website=Banjo.com |publisher=Banjo.com}}</ref>

Four-string banjos are used from time to time in musical theater. Examples include: ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'', ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[Half a Sixpence]]'', ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'', ''[[Barnum (musical)|Barnum]]'', ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', ''[[Monty Python's Spamalot]]'', and countless others. [[Joe Raposo]] had used it variably in the imaginative seven-piece orchestration for the long-running TV show ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and has sometimes had it overdubbed with itself or an electric guitar. The banjo is still (albeit rarely) in use in the show's arrangement currently.

The shorter-necked, tenor banjo, with 17 ("short scale") or 19 frets, is also typically played with a plectrum. It became a popular instrument after about 1910. Early models used for melodic picking typically had 17 frets on the neck and a scale length of 19{{frac|2}} to 21{{frac|2}}&nbsp;inches. By the mid-1920s, when the instrument was used primarily for strummed chordal accompaniment, 19-fret necks with a scale length of 21{{frac|3|4}} to 23&nbsp;inches became standard. The usual tuning is the [[all-fifths tuning]] C3 G3 D4 A4, in which exactly seven [[semitone]]s (a [[perfect fifth]]) occur between the [[open note]]s of consecutive [[open string (music)|string]]s; this is identical to the tuning of a [[viola]]. Other players (particularly in Irish traditional music) tune the banjo G2 D3 A3 E4 like an [[octave mandolin]], which lets the banjoist duplicate fiddle and mandolin fingering.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.deeringbanjos.com/blogs/banjo-playing-tips/10152829-the-symmetrical-tuning-of-the-tenor-banjo | title=The Tenor Banjo | publisher=Deering Banjo Company | date=14 November 2013 | access-date=27 June 2014 | author=Bandrowski, David}}</ref> The popularization of this tuning is usually attributed to the late [[Barney McKenna]], banjoist with [[The Dubliners]].<ref name=meade>{{cite web | url=http://blarneystar.com/BANJO_030912X.pdf | title=The Irish Tenor Banjo|website=Blarneystar.com | access-date=27 June 2014 | author=Meade, Don}}</ref> Fingerstyle on tenor banjo retuned to open G tuning dgd'g' or lower open D tuning Adad' (three finger picking, frailing) have been explored by Mirek Patek.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirekpatek.com |title=Patek style tenor banjo |publisher=Mirekpatek.com |access-date=31 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110220432/http://mirekpatek.com/ |archive-date=10 January 2016 }}</ref>

The tenor banjo was a common rhythm instrument in early 20th-century dance bands. Its volume and timbre suited early jazz (and jazz-influenced popular music styles) and could both compete with other instruments (such as [[brass instruments]] and saxophones) and be heard clearly on acoustic recordings. [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', in [[Ferde Grofe]]'s original jazz-orchestra arrangement, includes tenor banjo, with widely spaced chords not easily playable on plectrum banjo in its conventional tunings. With development of the archtop and electric guitar, the tenor banjo largely disappeared from jazz and popular music, though keeping its place in traditional "Dixieland" jazz.

Some 1920s Irish banjo players picked out the melodies of jigs, reels, and hornpipes on tenor banjos, decorating the tunes with snappy triplet ornaments. The most important Irish banjo player of this era was Mike Flanagan of the New York-based [[Flanagan Brothers]], one of the most popular Irish-American groups of the day. Other pre-WWII Irish banjo players included Neil Nolan, who recorded with Dan Sullivan's Shamrock Band in Boston, and Jimmy McDade, who recorded with the Four Provinces Orchestra in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, in Ireland, the rise of ''ceili'' bands provided a new market for a loud instrument like the tenor banjo. Use of the tenor banjo in Irish music has increased greatly since the folk revival of the 1960s.<ref name=meade/>

===Six-string banjos===
[[File:Banjo.png|left|thumb|300px|Old six-string zither banjo]]
The six-string banjo began as a British innovation by William Temlet, one of England's earliest banjo makers. He opened a shop in London in 1846, and sold banjos which he marketed as "zither" banjos from his 1869 patent. A zither banjo usually has a closed back and sides with the drum body and skin tensioning system suspended inside the wooden rim, the neck and string tailpiece mounted on the outside of the rim, and the drone string led through a tube in the neck so that the tuning peg can be mounted on the head. They were often made by builders who used guitar tuners that came in banks of three, so five-stringed instruments had a redundant tuner; these banjos could be somewhat easily converted over to a six-string banjo. 

American Alfred Davis Cammeyer (1862–1949), a young violinist turned concert banjo player, devised the six-string zither banjo around 1880. British opera diva [[Adelina Patti]] advised Cammeyer that the zither banjo might be popular with English audiences as it had been invented there, and Cammeyer went to London in 1888. With his virtuoso playing, he helped show that banjos could make more sophisticated music than normally played by [[blackface]] minstrels. He was soon performing for London society, where he met Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]], who recommended that Cammeyer progress from arranging the music of others for banjo to composing his own music.

Modern six-string bluegrass banjos have been made. These add a bass string between the lowest string and the drone string on a five-string banjo, and are usually tuned G4 G2 D3 G3 B3 D4. [[Sonny Osborne]] played one of these instruments for several years. It was modified by luthier Rual Yarbrough from a Vega five-string model. A picture of Sonny with this banjo appears in Pete Wernick's ''Bluegrass Banjo'' method book.<ref>Wernick, Pete; ''Bluegrass Banjo''; Oak Publications; Oakland, California: 1992, p. 27. 0-825-60148-7</ref>

Six-string banjos known as [[banjo guitar]]s basically consist of a six-string guitar neck attached to a bluegrass or plectrum banjo body, which allows players who have learned the guitar to play a banjo sound without having to relearn fingerings. This was the instrument of the early jazz great [[Johnny St. Cyr]], jazzmen [[Django Reinhardt]], [[Danny Barker]], [[Papa Charlie Jackson]] and [[Clancy Hayes]], as well as the blues and gospel singer [[Reverend Gary Davis]]. Today, musicians as diverse as [[Keith Urban]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Joe Satriani]], [[David Hidalgo]], [[Larry Lalonde]] and [[Doc Watson]] play the six-string guitar banjo. They have become increasingly popular since the mid-1990s.

==Other banjos==
===Low banjos===
[[File:Cello banjo from Gold Tone.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Cello banjo from Gold Tone]]
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, in vogue in plucked-string instrument ensembles – guitar orchestras, [[mandolin orchestra]]s, banjo orchestras – was when the instrumentation was made to parallel that of the string section in symphony orchestras. Thus, "violin, viola, 'cello, bass" became "mandolin, mandola, mandocello, mandobass", or in the case of banjos, "banjolin, banjola, banjo cello, bass banjo". Because the range of pluck-stringed instrument generally is not as great as that of comparably sized bowed-string instruments, other instruments were often added to these plucked orchestras to extend the range of the ensemble upwards and downwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbanjorm.com/images/PrincetonBanjoClub.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220200400/http://classicbanjorm.com/images/PrincetonBanjoClub.jpg |archive-date=20 December 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heftone.com/images/orchestra/music_box_rag/heftone_banjo_orchestra_18pc_660x1000.jpg |format=JPG |title=Photographic Image of Banjo Orchestra |website=Heftone.org |access-date=26 January 2017}}</ref> 

The banjo cello was normally tuned C2-G2-D3-A3, one octave below the tenor banjo like the cello and mandocello. A five-string cello banjo, set up like a bluegrass banjo (with the short fifth string), but tuned one octave lower, has been produced by the Goldtone company.<ref>{{cite web|author=Insert name |url=http://www.goldtone.com/products/details/w/instrument/374/CEB-5 |title=CEB-5 &#124; Gold Tone Music Group |publisher=Goldtone.com |date=27 November 2015 |access-date=31 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417124803/http://www.goldtone.com/products/details/w/instrument/374/CEB-5 |archive-date=17 April 2015 }}</ref>

[[File:1930's Gibson bass banjo ad.jpg|thumb|140px|Bass banjo]]
Bass banjos have been produced in both upright bass formats and with standard, horizontally carried banjo bodies. Contrabass banjos with either three or four strings have also been made; some of these had headstocks similar to those of bass violins. Tuning varies on these large instruments, with four-string models sometimes being tuned in 4ths like a bass violin (E1-A1-D2-G2) and sometimes in 5ths, like a four-string cello banjo, one octave lower (C1-G1-D2-A2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minstrelbanjo.ning.com/photo/contra-bass-banjo?xg_source=activity |title=Contra bass banjo – Minstrel Banjo |publisher=Minstrelbanjo.ning.com |date=21 April 2011 |access-date=31 January 2016}}</ref>

===Banjo hybrids and variants===
A number of hybrid instruments exist, crossing the banjo with other stringed instruments. Most of these use the body of a banjo, often with a resonator, and the neck of the other instrument. Examples include the [[banjo mandolin]] (first patented in 1882)<ref name=paper>{{cite web|url=http://blarneystar.com/BANJO_030912X.pdf |title=The Irish Tenor Banjo |author=Don Meade |website=Blarneystar.com |access-date=26 January 2017}}</ref> and the [[banjo ukulele]], most famously played by the English comedian [[George Formby]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article4029395.ece | location=London (subscription required)| work=The Times | title=George Formbys Little Strad banjolele up for sale | date=30 May 2008}}</ref> These were especially popular in the early decades of the 20th century, and were probably a result of a desire either to allow players of other instruments to jump on the banjo bandwagon at the height of its popularity, or to get the natural amplification benefits of the banjo resonator in an age before electric amplification.

Conversely, the [[tenor guitar|tenor and plectrum guitars]] use the respective banjo necks on guitar bodies. They arose in the early 20th century as a way for banjo players to double on guitar without having to relearn the instrument entirely.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.tenorguitar.com/what.html| title=What is a tenor guitar|access-date=September 1, 2020}}</ref>

Instruments that have a five-string banjo neck on a wooden body (for example, a guitar, [[bouzouki]], or [[dobro]] body) have also been made, such as the [[banjola]]. A 20th-century [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]] instrument similar to the banjo is called the ''[[cümbüş]]'', which combines a banjo-like resonator with a neck derived from an [[oud]]. At the end of the 20th century, a development of the five-string banjo was the [[BanSitar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helmutrheingans.co.uk/bansitar |title=Bansitar |website=Helmutrheingans.co.uk |access-date=26 January 2017}}</ref> This features a bone bridge, giving the instrument a [[sitar]]-like resonance.

*[[Frank Lawes]] (1894–1970), of the United Kingdom, developed a unique fingerstyle technique on the four-string plectrum instrument, and was a prolific composer of four-string banjo music, much of which is still performed and recorded today.
*[[Harry Reser]] (1896–1965), plectrum and tenor banjo, was regarded by some as the best tenor banjoist of the 1920s. He wrote a large number of works for tenor banjo, as well as instructional material, authoring numerous banjo method books,<ref>e.g., ''Harry Reser's Manual for Tenor Banjo Technique'' (Robbins Music Corporation, 1927); ''Harry Reser's Let's Play The Tenor Banjo'' (Remick Music Crop, 1959); ''Picture-Chords for Tenor Banjo'' (Remick Music Crop, 1960); ''et al''</ref> over a dozen other instrumental method books (for guitar; ukulele; mandolin; etc.), and was well known in the banjo community. Reser's accomplished single string and "chord melody" technique set a "high mark" that many subsequent tenor players endeavored – and still endeavor – to attain.
* Other important four-string performers were [[Mike Pingitore]], who played tenor for the [[Paul Whiteman Orchestra]] through 1948, and [[Roy Smeck]], early radio and recording pioneer, author of many instructional books, and whose influential performances on many fretted instruments earned him the nickname "Wizard of the Strings", during his active years (1922–1950). Prominent tenor players of more recent vintage include [[Narvin Kimball]] (d. 2006) (left-handed banjoist of [[Preservation Hall Jazz Band]] fame), [[Barney McKenna]] (d. 2012) (one of the founding members of [[The Dubliners]]).
* Notable four-string players currently active include [[ragtime]] and [[dixieland]] stylists [[Charlie Tagawa]] (b. 1935) and [[Bill Lowrey (musician)|Bill Lowrey]] (b. 1963). Jazz guitarist [[Howard Alden]] (b. 1958) began his career on tenor banjo and still plays it at traditional jazz events. [[Cynthia Sayer]] (b. 1962) is regarded as one of the top jazz plectrum banjoists. Rock and country performer [[Winston Marshall]] (b. 1988) plays banjo (among other instruments) for the British [[folk rock]] group [[Mumford and Sons]], a band that won the 2013 [[Grammy Award]] for "Best Album of the Year".
*[[Earl Scruggs]] (1924–2012), whose career ranged from the end of World War II into the 21st century, is widely regarded as the father of the bluegrass style of banjo playing.<ref name="Willis">Willis, Barry R.; ''America's Music: Bluegrass : A History of Bluegrass Music in the Words of Its Pioneers''; Pine Valley Music, 1997. {{ISBN|0-965240-70-3}}</ref> The three-finger style of playing he developed while playing with [[Bill Monroe]]'s band is known by his name: ''[[Scruggs Style]]''.<ref name="trischka">Trischka, Tony, "Earl Scruggs", ''Banjo Song Book'', Oak Publications, 1977</ref>
*[[Ralph Stanley]] (1927-2016) had a long career, both with his brother as "The Stanley Brothers" and with his band "The Clinch Mountain Boys. He was awarded an honorary doctorate of music by Lincoln Memorial University, is a member of the [[Bluegrass Hall of Fame]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. He won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Male Country Vocal Performance]] in the movie [[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]].
*[[Pete Seeger]] (1919–2014), although perhaps most widely known as a singer-songwriter with folk group [[The Weavers]], included five-string banjo among his instruments. His 1948 method book ''How to Play the Five-String Banjo'' has been credited by thousands of banjoists, including prominent professionals, with sparking their interest in the instrument. He is also credited with inventing the [[Pete Seeger#Banjo and 12-string guitar|long-neck banjo]] (also known as the "Seeger Banjo"), which adds three lower frets to the five-string banjo's neck, and tunes the four main strings down by a minor third, to facilitate playing in singing keys more comfortable for some folk guitarists.
* Among a long list of prominent five-string banjo pickers are [[Roy Clark]] (1933–2018); [[Ben Eldridge]] (b. 1938); [[John Hartford]] (d. 2001); [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]] (1939–2015); [[Sonny Osborne]] (b. 1937); [[Tony Trischka]] (b. 1949); [[Pete Wernick]] (b. 1946); [[Rual Yarbrough]] (d. 2010); George Gibson (b. 1938); and Clifton Hicks (b. 1985). Most of these musicians play (or played) bluegrass music, though some crossed over into other styles, and some are/were multi-instrumentalists.
*[[Béla Fleck]] (b. 1958) is widely acknowledged as one of the world's most innovative and technically proficient banjo players.<ref name="Rhapsody">{{cite web|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/bela-fleck |title=Bela Fleck |publisher=Rhapsody |access-date=8 August 2013}}</ref> His work spans many styles and genres, including jazz, bluegrass, classical, R&B, avant garde, and "world music", and he has produced a substantial discography and videography.
