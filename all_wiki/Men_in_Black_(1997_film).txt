'''''Men in Black''''' is a 1997 American [[science fiction]] [[Action film|action]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], produced by [[Walter F. Parkes]] and [[Laurie MacDonald]] and written by [[Ed Solomon]]. Loosely based on ''[[The Men in Black (comics)|The Men in Black]]'' [[comic book]] series created by [[Lowell Cunningham]] and [[Sandy Carruthers]], the film stars  [[Tommy Lee Jones]] and [[Will Smith]] as two agents of a secret organization called the [[Men in Black]], who supervise [[extraterrestrial life]]forms who live on Earth and hide their existence from ordinary humans. The film featured the creature effects and makeup of [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] and visual effects by [[Industrial Light & Magic]].

The film was released in the United States on July 2, 1997, by [[Columbia Pictures]], and grossed over $589.3 million worldwide against a $90 million budget, becoming the year's third highest-grossing film. It received positive reviews, with critics praising its humor, action sequences, Jones and Smith's performances, special effects and [[Danny Elfman]]'s musical score. The film received three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations: [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], winning the latter award.

The film spawned two sequels, ''[[Men in Black II]]'' (2002) and ''[[Men in Black 3]]'' (2012); a spin-off film, ''[[Men in Black: International]]'' (2019); and a [[Men in Black: The Series|1997–2001 animated series]].

==Plot==
<!-- KEEP THE PLOT SHORT. As per [[WP:FILMPLOT]] summaries should be under 700 words. -->
After a government agency makes [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] with [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] in 1961, alien refugees live in secret on Earth by disguising themselves as humans. Men in Black (MIB) is a secret agency that polices these aliens, protects Earth from extraterrestrial threats and uses memory-erasing [[neuralyzer]]s to keep alien activity a secret. MIB agents have their former identities erased while retired agents are neuralyzed. After an operation to arrest an alien criminal named Mikey near the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexican border]] by Agents [[Agent K|K]] and D, the latter decides that he is too old for his job, prompting the former to neuralyze him so he can retire.

Meanwhile, [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] undercover officer [[Agent J|James Darrell Edwards III]] pursues an unnaturally fast and agile suspect into the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]. Impressed, K interviews James about his encounter, then neuralyzes him and leaves him a business card with an address. Edwards goes to the address and undergoes a series of tests, for which he finds unorthodox solutions, including a rational hesitation in a targeting test. While the other candidates, who are military-grade, are neuralyzed, K offers Edwards a position with the MIB. Edwards accepts and his identity and civilian life are erased as he becomes Agent J.

In upstate New York, an alien illegally crash-lands on Earth, kills a farmer named Edgar and uses his skin as a disguise. Tasked with finding a device called "The Galaxy", the Edgar alien goes into a New York restaurant and finds two aliens (disguised as humans) who are supposed to have it in their possession. He kills them and takes a container from them but is angered to find only diamonds inside. After learning about the incident in a tabloid magazine, K investigates the crash landing and concludes that Edgar's skin was taken by a "bug", a species of aggressive cockroach-like aliens. He and J head to a morgue to examine the bodies the bug killed. Inside one body (which turns out to be a piloted robot) they discover a dying Arquillian alien, who says that "to prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's belt". The alien, who used the name ''Rosenberg'', was a member of the Arquillian royal family; K fears his death may spark a war.

MIB informant [[Frank the Pug]] explains that the missing galaxy is a massive energy source housed in a small jewel. J deduces that the galaxy is hanging on the collar of Rosenberg's cat, Orion, which refuses to leave the body at the morgue. J and K arrive just as the bug takes the galaxy and kidnaps the coroner, Laurel Weaver. Meanwhile, an Arquillian battleship fires a warning shot in the [[Arctic]] and delivers an ultimatum to the MIB: return the galaxy within a "galactic standard week", in an hour of Earth time, or they will destroy Earth.

The bug arrives at the observation towers of the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] [[New York State Pavilion]] at [[Flushing Meadows]], which disguise two real flying saucers. Once there, Laurel escapes the bug's clutches when it accidentally drops her. It activates one of the saucers and tries to leave Earth, but K and J shoot it down and the ship crashes into the [[Unisphere]]. The bug sheds Edgar's skin and swallows J and K's guns. K provokes it until he too is swallowed. The bug tries to escape on the other ship, but J slows it down by taunting it and crushing cockroaches, angering it. K blows the bug apart from the inside, having found his gun inside its stomach. J and K recover the galaxy and relax, thinking the whole ordeal over, only for the still living upper half of the bug to pounce on them from behind, but Laurel kills it with J's gun.

At the MIB headquarters, K tells J that he has not been training him as a partner, but a replacement. K bids J farewell before J neuralyzes him at his request; K returns to his civilian life, and Laurel becomes J's new partner, L. 

==Cast==
* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as [[Agent K|Kevin Brown / Agent K]]: J's grizzled and humorless mentor. [[Clint Eastwood]] turned down the part, while Jones only accepted the role after [[Steven Spielberg]] promised the script would improve, based on his respect for Spielberg's track record. He had been disappointed with the first draft, which he reportedly said "stank"; he felt it did not capture the tone of the comic.<ref name=hughes/>
* [[Will Smith]] as [[Agent J|James Darrell Edwards III / Agent J]]: A former NYPD detective, newly recruited to the MIB. Smith was cast because [[Barry Sonnenfeld]]'s wife was a fan of ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. Sonnenfeld also liked his performance in ''[[Six Degrees of Separation (film)|Six Degrees of Separation]]''.<ref name=hughes/> [[Chris O'Donnell]] turned down the role because he found the role of a new recruit too similar to [[Dick Grayson]], whom he played in ''[[Batman Forever]]'' and ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''.<ref>{{cite news | title = Summer Movie Preview | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1997-05-16 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,287928,00.html | access-date=2007-09-17}}</ref> [[David Schwimmer]] also turned down the part.<ref name=hughes/> Like Jones, Smith said he accepted the role after meeting with Spielberg and cited his success as a producer.
* [[Linda Fiorentino]] as Dr. Laurel Weaver / Agent L: A deputy medical examiner, and later J's partner.
* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as the Bug: A giant alien insect who eats a farmer named Edgar and uses his skin and clothes as a disguise. He comes to earth to kidnap the Galaxy and use it to destroy the Arquillians. [[John Turturro]] and [[Bruce Campbell]] were both offered the role, but they turned it down, due to scheduling conflicts.<ref name="hughes" />
** D'Onofrio also portrays Edgar, the farmer/abusive husband who gets killed by the Bug and has his form used by him.
* [[Rip Torn]] as Chief Zed: The head of the MIB.
* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as Jack Jeebs: An alien, posing as a [[pawn shop]] owner, who deals in illegal weapons.

* [[Becky Ann Baker]] as Mrs. Redgick
* [[Carel Struycken]] as Arquillian
* [[Fredric Lehne]] as Agent Janus
* [[Kent Faulcon]] as Jake Jensen

==Production==
{{more citations needed section|date=December 2011}}

===Development===
The film is loosely based on [[Lowell Cunningham]] and [[Sandy Carruthers]]'s comic book ''[[The Men in Black (comics)|The Men in Black]]''. Producers [[Walter F. Parkes]] and [[Laurie MacDonald]] optioned the rights to ''The Men in Black'' in 1992, and hired [[Ed Solomon]] to write a very faithful script. Parkes and MacDonald wanted [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] as director because he had helmed the darkly humorous ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' and its sequel ''[[Addams Family Values]]''. However, Sonnenfeld was attached to ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'' (1995), so they instead approached [[Les Mayfield]] to direct, as they had heard about the positive reception to his remake of ''[[Miracle on 34th Street (1994 film)|Miracle on 34th Street]]''; they actually saw the film later and decided he was inappropriate.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} As a result, ''Men in Black'' was delayed so as to allow Sonnenfeld to make it his next project after ''Get Shorty''.<ref name=hughes>{{cite book | author = David Hughes | title = Comic Book Movies | publisher = [[Virgin Books]] | year = 2003 | location = London | pages = 123–129 | isbn = 0-7535-0767-6}}</ref>

Much of the initial script drafts were set underground, with locations ranging from [[Kansas]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Nevada]]. Sonnenfeld decided to change the location to New York City, because the director felt New Yorkers would be tolerant of aliens who behaved oddly while disguised. He also felt much of the city's structures resembled [[flying saucer]]s and [[Space vehicle|rocket ships]].<ref name=hughes/> One of the locations Sonnenfeld thought perfect for the movie was a giant ventilation structure for the [[Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel]], which became the outside of the MIB headquarters.<ref name=met/>

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] began in March 1996. Many last-minute changes ensued during production. First, the scene where James Edwards chasing a disguised alien was to be filmed at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], but the [[New York Philharmonic]] decided to charge the filmmakers for using their buildings, prompting Sonnenfeld to film the scene at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] instead. Then, five months into the shoot, Sonnenfeld decided that the original ending, with a humorous [[Existentialism|existential]] debate between Agent J and the Bug, was unexciting and lacking the action that the rest of the film had.<ref name=met>"Metamorphosis of 'Men in Black'", ''Men in Black'' Blu-ray</ref> Five potential replacements were discussed. One of these had Laurel Weaver being neuralyzed and K remaining an agent.<ref name=hughes/> Eventually it boiled down to the Bug eating K and fighting J, replacing the [[animatronic]] Bug [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]]'s crew had developed with a [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] Bug with an appearance closer to a cockroach. The whole action sequence cost an extra $4.5 million to the filmmakers.<ref name=met/>

Further changes were made during post-production to simplify the plotline involving the possession of the tiny galaxy. The Arquillians would hand over the galaxy to the Baltians, ending a long war. The Bugs need to feed on the casualties and steal the galaxy in order to continue the war. Through changing of subtitles, the images on M.I.B.'s main computer and Frank the Pug's dialogue, the Baltians were eliminated from the plot. Earth goes from being potentially destroyed in the crossfire between the two races into being possibly destroyed by the Arquillians themselves to prevent the Bugs from getting the galaxy.<ref name=hughes/> These changes to the plot were carried out when only two weeks remained in the film's post-production, but the film's novelization still contains the Baltians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/55992|title=Things Get A Bit Heated Between The Infamous Billy The Kidd And Director Barry Sonnenfeld When They Talk MEN IN BLACK 3|author=Donnelly, Billy|website=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=May 25, 2012}}</ref>

===Design and visual effects===
Production designer [[Bo Welch]] designed the MIB headquarters with a 1960s tone in mind, because that was when their organization is formed. He cited influences from Finnish architect [[Eero Saarinen]], who designed a terminal at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]. As the arrival point of aliens on Earth, Welch felt the headquarters had to resemble an airport.<ref name=hughes/>

[[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] was approached to provide the prostethic and animatronic aliens, many of whom would have more otherworldly designs instead of looking humanoid. For example, the reveal of Gentle Rosenberg's Arquillian nature went from a man with a light under his neck's skin to a small alien hidden inside a human head. Baker would describe ''Men in Black'' as the most complex production in his career, "requiring more sketches than all my previous movies together".<ref name=met/> Baker had to have approval from both Sonnenfeld and Spielberg: "It was like, 'Steven likes the head on this one and Barry really likes the body on this one, so why don't you do a mix and match?' And I'd say, because it wouldn't make any sense." Sonnenfeld also changed a lot of the film's aesthetic during pre-production: "I started out saying aliens shouldn't be what humans perceive them to be. Why do they need eyes? So Rick did these great designs, and I'd say, 'That's great &mdash; but how do we know where he's looking?' I ended up where everyone else did, only I took three months."<ref>{{cite news | author = Steve Daly | title = Men in Black: How'd they do that? | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1997-07-18 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,288677,00.html | access-date=2007-09-17}}</ref> The maquettes built by Baker's team would later be digitized by [[Industrial Light & Magic]], who was responsible for the visual effects and computer-generated imagery, for more mobile digital versions of the aliens.<ref name=met/>

==Music==
{{main|Men in Black: The Album}}
Two different soundtracks for the film were released in the U.S.: a [[film score|score]] soundtrack featuring music composed by [[Danny Elfman]] and an [[Men in Black: The Album|album]] of songs used in and inspired by the film, featuring [[Will Smith]]'s original song "[[Men in Black (song)|Men in Black]]" based on the film's plot. In the UK, only the album was released.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

An official comic adaptation was released by [[Marvel Comics]]. The film also received a [[third-person shooter]] [[Men in Black: The Game|''Men in Black'' game]] developed by Gigawatt Studios and published by Gremlin Interactive, which was released to lackluster reviews in October 1997 for the PC and the following year for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. Also, a very rare promotional PlayStation video game system was released in 1997 with the Men in Black logo on the CD lid. Three months after the film's release, an [[Men in Black: The Series|animated series]] based on ''Men in Black'', produced by [[Columbia TriStar Television]] alongside [[Adelaide Productions]] and [[Amblin Television]], began airing on [[The WB]]'s [[Kids' WB]] programming block, and also inspired several games. A ''[[Men In Black: The Roleplaying Game|Men in Black]]'' role-playing game was also released in 1997 by [[West End Games]].

It's also extraordinarily ambitious, with all-star design and special-effects talent and a genuinely artful visual style. As with his ''Addams Family'' films and ''Get Shorty,'' which were more overtly funny than the sneakily subtle ''Men in Black,'' Mr. Sonnenfeld takes offbeat genre material and makes it boldly mainstream."<ref>{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/01/movies/oh-aliens-business-as-usual.html|title=Oh, Aliens: Business As Usual|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 1, 1997|access-date=June 3, 2019}}</ref>

Writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Todd McCarthy acknowledged the film was "witty and sometimes surreal sci-fi comedy" in which he praised the visual effects, Baker's creature designs and Elfman's musical score.
