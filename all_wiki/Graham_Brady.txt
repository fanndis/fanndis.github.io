==Politics==

===Member of Parliament===
He was selected to contest the [[Altrincham and Sale West (UK Parliament constituency)|Altrincham and Sale West]] [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] constituency, following the retirement of the veteran Conservative MP [[Fergus Montgomery]]. Brady's constituency is considered to be a Conservative [[safe seat]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/election-97-parties-scramble-to-claim-the-mantle-of-youth-1268748.html |title=Election '97: Parties scramble to claim the mantle of youth |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |last=Abrams |first=Fran |date=23 April 1997 |accessdate=3 September 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110012310/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/election-97-parties-scramble-to-claim-the-mantle-of-youth-1268748.html |archive-date=10 November 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> having returned only Conservative MPs during its existence. The [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] proved to be a close battle in the seat, but Brady was elected with a majority of 1,505 votes. He was the youngest Conservative MP to be elected in 1997, being aged 29.

Brady made his [[maiden speech]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 2 June 1997. In 1998 he made enquiries to [[John Bourn]], at the time [[Comptroller and Auditor General]], on his decision not to publish a [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] report on the controversial [[Al-Yamamah arms deal]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Exhibit 1 |url=https://cryptome.org/soil/soiled-dove2.htm#Exhibit%201 |website=[[Cryptome]] |accessdate=25 May 2019 |date=29 June 1998 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005131607/https://cryptome.org/soil/soiled-dove2.htm#Exhibit%201 |archive-date=5 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The same year, Brady was one of only 13 Conservative MPs who voted in favour of an equal age of consent.<ref name="hansard.parliament.uk">{{Cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2013-02-05/debates/13020551000002/Marriage(SameSexCouples)Bill|title=Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill - Hansard|website=hansard.parliament.uk|access-date=2019-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617172658/https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2013-02-05/debates/13020551000002/Marriage(SameSexCouples)Bill|archive-date=17 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> He became a Member of the [[Department for Education and Employment|Education and Employment]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select committee]], and [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] (PPS) to the [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]], [[Michael Ancram]] in 1999. He was made an [[Whip (politics)|Opposition Whip]] by [[William Hague]] in 2000. In February 2000, Brady complained about anti-grammar school literature circulated to parents in Altrincham by Michael Evans, then head of [[Trinity Church of England High School]], arguing that this violated rules about public funds being used for campaign material – a complaint subsequently upheld by [[Secretary of State for Education]] [[David Blunkett]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Complaint upheld over grammar campaign |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/648224.stm |accessdate=25 May 2019 |work=BBC News |date=18 February 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525061832/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/648224.stm |archive-date=25 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> That same year Brady would become an Opposition Spokesman on [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Education and Employment]].

Following a second Conservative defeat at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], Brady continued as an Opposition Spokesman on [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Education and Skills]] under the leadership of both Hague and [[Iain Duncan Smith|Duncan Smith]]. He became the PPS to the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]], [[Michael Howard]] in 2003, and an Opposition Spokesman on [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Affairs]] and Shadow [[European Union|Europe]] Minister in 2004.

===Shadow Ministerial resignation===
On 29 May 2007, Brady resigned his post as Shadow Minister for Europe in protest at Conservative leader [[David Cameron]]'s opposition to [[grammar school]]s. He told the BBC that: "faced with a choice between a front bench position that I have loved and doing what I believe to be right for my constituents and for the many hundreds of thousands of families who are ill-served by state education in this country, there is in conscience only one option open to me", and argued that "grammar schools in selective areas are exactly the motor that does drive social mobility more effectively than comprehensive areas."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6701877.stm |title=Tory quits post over grammars row |work=BBC News |date=29 May 2007 |accessdate=4 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705120706/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6701877.stm |archive-date=5 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Brady's own constituency has retained a selective rather than comprehensive education system.

In 2013, he opposed the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]], raising concerns that the measure had not been in the Conservative manifesto and that religious freedom could be compromised.<ref name="hansard.parliament.uk"/>

In the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 EU referendum]], he was a supporter of [[Brexit]].<ref name="thespectatorwhichtorympsbackbrexit">{{cite news |last1=Goodenough |first1=Tom |title=Which Tory MPs back Brexit, who doesn't and who is still on the fence? |url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/02/which-tory-mps-back-brexit-who-doesnt-and-who-is-still-on-the-fence/ |accessdate=11 October 2016 |work=The Spectator |date=16 February 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203120144/http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/02/which-tory-mps-back-brexit-who-doesnt-and-who-is-still-on-the-fence/ |archive-date=3 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== COVID-19 lockdowns ===
In May 2020, Brady called for the removal of "arbitrary rules and limitations on freedom" brought in by the government because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 pandemic]].
