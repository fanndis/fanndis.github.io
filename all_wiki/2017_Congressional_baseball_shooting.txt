==Background==
The shooting took place on June 14, 2017, at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], across the [[Potomac River]] from Washington, D.C. There were 24 Republican congressmen who had gathered at the park to practice for the next day's [[Congressional Baseball Game|Congressional Baseball Game for Charity]], an annual, bipartisan event first held in 1909. Among those at the practice, aside from Scalise, were Senators [[Rand Paul]] and [[Jeff Flake]], and Representatives [[Roger Williams (American politician)|Roger Williams]] (the team's coach), [[Chuck Fleischmann]], [[Trent Kelly]], [[Mo Brooks]], [[Brad Wenstrup]], [[Rodney Davis (politician)|Rodney Davis]], [[Jeff Duncan (politician)|Jeff Duncan]], [[Jack Bergman]], and [[Joe Barton]] (the team's [[manager (baseball)|manager]]).<ref name="Fox News"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/14/shots-fired-republican-party-baseball-practice-near-washington|title=Senior Republican politician Steve Scalise and several aides shot at baseball practice near Washington DC|first=Harriet|last=Alexander|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=June 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614130228/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/14/shots-fired-republican-party-baseball-practice-near-washington/|archive-date=June 14, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/us-congressman-hit-in-shooting-in-washington-dc-suburb-20170614-gwrcbg.html|title=US Congressman Steve Scalise hit in shooting in Washington DC suburb|last=Tovey|first=Josephine|date=July 1, 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=June 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615084805/http://www.smh.com.au/world/us-congressman-hit-in-shooting-in-washington-dc-suburb-20170614-gwrcbg.html|archive-date=June 15, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2017/06/14/congressman-joe-bartons-hometown-grateful|title=Congressman Joe Barton's Hometown Grateful He Survived Shooting|last=Roxas|first=Gabriel|date=June 14, 2017|publisher=[[KTVT]]|access-date=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619175735/http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2017/06/14/congressman-joe-bartons-hometown-grateful/|archive-date=June 19, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

According to Representatives [[Ron DeSantis]] and [[Jeff Duncan (politician)|Jeff Duncan]], they were approached before the shooting at the practice by a man who asked whether [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] were practicing on the field. Duncan reportedly replied that it was the Republican team.

==Shooting==
[[File:Eyewitness Account- Senator Jeff Flake on Congressional Shooting.webm|thumb|Senator [[Jeff Flake]] recounts the incident to a [[Voice of America]] reporter.]]
The practice had been underway for about half an hour when James Hodgkinson began firing. According to the Capitol Police, he was armed with an [[SKS]] rifle and a 9mm [[Smith & Wesson]] handgun, both of which he had apparently purchased legally.<ref name="reuters61517"/> It was unclear if Hodgkinson used the handgun during the shooting incident.<ref>{{cite web|first=Aaron|last=Smith|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/06/15/news/sks-rifle-gop-baseball-field-attack/index.html|title=The long history of the gun used in the GOP baseball attack|publisher=CNN|date=June 16, 2017|access-date=June 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616152347/https://money.cnn.com/2017/06/15/news/sks-rifle-gop-baseball-field-attack/index.html|archive-date=June 16, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

When Hodgkinson opened fire, two of the officers, David Bailey and Crystal Griner, rushed onto the field to protect the congressmen and the other civilians. Hodgkinson sought cover behind the third base dugout as the third Capitol Police officer, Henry Cabrera, took aim at him from behind the first base dugout.<ref name="cbsheroes"/><ref name="nbcheroes"/>

At 7:09&nbsp;am, the [[Alexandria Police]] received a [[9-1-1]] report of shots fired. Two police officers arrived within three minutes and also engaged Hodgkinson in a [[gunfight]]. Witnesses estimated between 50 and 100 shots were fired during the [[shootout]], which lasted about 10 minutes before Hodgkinson was shot by Alexandria Police officers Nicole Battaglia, Alexander Jensen and Kevin Jobe and Capitol Police officers Bailey and Griner.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wtop.com/alexandria/2017/06/baseball-shooting-alexandria-police-chief-praises-officers-braved-hail-bullets|title=Baseball shooting: Alexandria police chief praises officers who braved hail of bullets|date=2017-06-19|work=WTOP|access-date=2017-06-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622130502/http://wtop.com/alexandria/2017/06/baseball-shooting-alexandria-police-chief-praises-officers-braved-hail-bullets/|archive-date=June 22, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="pbs">{{cite news|title=House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and others shot at congressional baseball practice|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/shooting-reported-congressional-softball-practice|access-date=July 1, 2017|work=PBS NewsHour|date=June 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627214405/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/shooting-reported-congressional-softball-practice/|archive-date=June 27, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=BBC>{{cite news|title=Gunman dead after attacking congressmen at Virginia baseball field|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40275055|access-date=June 14, 2017|publisher=BBC News|date=February 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614122437/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40275055|archive-date=June 14, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Scalise, who was at [[Second baseman|second base]] when the shooting started, was shot in the hip and tried to drag himself off the field. While the shooting was still going on, Rep. [[Mo Brooks]] used his belt as a [[tourniquet]] to help stop bleeding for a staffer who had been shot in the calf. After the shooting ended, Brooks and Rep. [[Brad Wenstrup]]—a [[podiatrist]] and [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Reservist]] who served with the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[Combat Support Hospital|344th Combat Support Hospital]]—were able to assist Scalise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/337723-gop-rep-recounts-using-belt-as-tourniquet-at-baseball-practice-shooting|newspaper=The Hill|title=GOP rep recounts using belt as tourniquet at baseball practice shooting|first=Ben|last=Kamisar|date=June 14, 2017|access-date=February 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618064218/http://thehill.com/homenews/house/337723-gop-rep-recounts-using-belt-as-tourniquet-at-baseball-practice-shooting|archive-date=June 18, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Several witnesses said their lives were saved by the presence of the Capitol Police, who were there because of Scalise's position as the House Majority Whip. The Capitol Police immediately engaged Hodgkinson and kept him pinned down, preventing him from continuing to fire on the unarmed baseball players. Rep. Davis and Sen. [[Rand Paul]] separately said that if not for the presence of the officers, the incident "would have been a massacre."<ref>{{cite news|title=Rep.
