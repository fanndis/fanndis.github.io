The '''secretary-general of the United Nations''' ('''UNSG''' or '''SG''') is the [[chief administrative officer]] of the [[United Nations]] and head of the [[United Nations Secretariat]], one of the [[United Nations System#Six principal organs|six principal organs of the United Nations]]. 

The role of the secretary-general and of the Secretariat is laid out by [[Chapter XV of the United Nations Charter|Chapter&nbsp;XV]] (Articles&nbsp;97 to 101) of the [[United Nations Charter]]. However, the office's qualifications, selection process, and tenure are open to interpretation and have been established by custom.<ref>{{cite news |last=Urquhart |first=Brian |date=2009-01-28 |title=The Next Secretary-General: How to Fill a Job With No Description |journal=Foreign Affairs: America and the World |language=en-US |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2006-09-01/next-secretary-general-how-fill-job-no-description |access-date=2020-09-03 |issn=0015-7120}}</ref>

As of 2020, the secretary-general is former [[prime minister of Portugal]] [[António Guterres]], who was [[2016 United Nations Secretary-General selection|appointed by the General Assembly on 13 October 2016]] and began his five-year term on 1 January 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ask.un.org/faq/14625 |title=Who is and has been Secretary-General of the United Nations? - Ask DAG! |website=ask.un.org |access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>

==Selection and term of office==
{{see also|United Nations Secretary-General selection}}

[[File:Newyork unitednations.JPG|thumb|left|The [[United Nations Secretariat Building|Secretariat Building]] is a {{convert|154|m|ft|-tall|adj=mid}} skyscraper and the centerpiece of the [[Headquarters of the United Nations]]. ]]

The secretary-general is appointed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] upon the recommendation of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. As the recommendation must come from the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], any of the five [[United Nations Security Council veto power|permanent members of the council can veto]] a nomination. Most secretaries-general are compromise candidates from [[middle power]]s and have little prior fame.

Unofficial qualifications for the job have been set by precedent in previous selections. The appointee may not be a citizen of any of the Security Council's five permanent members.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/un/life/job.html |title=Kofi Annan: Job at a Glance |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=[[PBS]] |publisher=Educational Broadcasting Corporation |year=2002 |url-status=live |archive-date=20 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420181539/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/un/life/job.html}}</ref> The General Assembly resolution 51/241 in 1997 stated that, in the appointment of "the best candidate", due regard should be given to regional (continental) rotation of the appointee's national origin and to gender equality,<ref name=SRR2015>{{cite book |title=Appointing the UN Secretary-General |url=http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/special-research-report/appointing-the-un-secretary-general.php |series=Research Report |volume=2015 |date=16 October 2015 |issue=2 |location=New York |publisher=Security Council Report, Inc. |pages=4–5 |format=PDF}}</ref>{{rp|5}} although no woman has yet served as secretary-general. All appointees to date have been [[Career diplomat|career diplomats]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Role of the UN Secretary-General |url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/role-un-secretary-general |access-date=2020-09-03 |website=Council on Foreign Relations}}</ref>

The length of the term is discretionary, but all secretaries-general since 1971 have been appointed to five-year terms. Every secretary-general since 1961 has been re-selected for a second term, with the exception of [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], who was [[List of vetoed United Nations Security Council resolutions|vetoed]] by the United States in the [[1996 United Nations Secretary-General selection|1996 selection]]. There is a term limit of two full terms, established when China, in the [[1981 United Nations Secretary-General selection|1981 selection]], cast a record 16 vetoes against a third term for Kurt Waldheim. No secretary-general since 1981 has attempted to secure a third term.

The selection process is opaque and is often compared to a [[papal conclave]].<ref name=

"Position of U.N. Chief Aide is Thrust Into Uncertainty". ''The New York Times''. p. 1.</ref>

In 2016, the General Assembly and the Security Council sought nominations and conducted public debates for the first time. However, the Security Council voted in private and followed the same process as previous selections, leading the [[President of the United Nations General Assembly|president of the General Assembly]] to complain that it "does not live up to the expectations of the membership and the new standard of openness and transparency".<ref>{{cite web |title=Letter from Mogens Lykketoft to All Permanent Representatives and Permanent Observers to the United Nations, 21 July 2016 |url=https://www.un.org/pga/70/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2015/08/20-July_Security-Council-Straw-Polls-on-SG-candidates.pdf |date=21 July 2016}}</ref>

==Powers and duties==
The role of secretary-general is described as combining the functions and responsibilities of an advocate, diplomat, civil servant, and CEO.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |date=2015-04-22 |title=The role of the Secretary-General |url=https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/role-secretary-general |access-date=2020-09-02 |website=United Nations Secretary-General}}</ref> The UN Charter designates the secretary-general as the "chief administrative officer" of the UN and allows him to perform "such other functions as are entrusted" by other United Nations organs. The Charter also empowers the secretary-general to inform the Security Council of "any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security". These provision has been interpreted as providing broad leeway for officeholders to serve a variety of roles as suited to their preferences, skill set, or the circumstances.<ref name=":1">{{cite web |title=The Role of the UN Secretary-General |url=https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/role-un-secretary-general |access-date=2020-09-03 |website=Council on Foreign Relations}}</ref>

The secretary-general's routine duties include overseeing the activities and duties of the Secretariat; attending sessions with United Nations bodies; consulting with world leaders, government officials, and other stakeholders; and traveling the world to engage with global constituents and bring attention to certain international issues.<ref name=":0"/> The secretary-general publishes an annual report on the work of the UN, which includes an assessment of its activities and an outline future priorities. He or she is also Chairman of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB), a body composed of the heads of all UN funds, programmes and specialized agencies, which meets twice a year to discuss substantive and management issues facing the [[United Nations System]].<ref name=":0"/>

Many of the secretary-general's powers are informal and left open to individual interpretation; some appointees have opted for more activist roles, while others have been more technocratic or administrative.<ref name=":1"/> The SG is often reliant upon the use of his or her "good offices", described as "steps taken publicly and in private, drawing upon his independence, impartiality and integrity, to prevent international disputes from arising, escalating or spreading".<ref name=":0"/> Consequently, observers have variably described the office as the "world's most visible [[bully pulpit]]" or as the "world's moderator".<ref>{{cite web |date=2016-10-10 |title=The Secretary-General Is Dead; Long Live the Secretary-General |url=https://observer.com/2016/10/the-secretary-general-is-dead-long-live-the-secretary-general/ |access-date=2020-09-02 |website=Observer |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":1"/> Examples include Dag Hammarskjöld's promotion of an armistice between the warring parties of Arab-Israel conflict, Javier Perez de Cuellar's negotiation of a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq War, and U Thant's role in de-esalating the Cuban Missile Crisis.<ref name=":1"/> 

==Residence==
The official residence of the secretary-general is a townhouse at 3 [[York Avenue and Sutton Place|Sutton Place, Manhattan]], in New York City, United States. The townhouse was built for [[Anne Morgan (philanthropist)|Anne Morgan]] in 1921, and donated to the United Nations in 1972.<ref>Teltsch, Kathleen.
