A '''dacha''' ({{lang-rus|дача|p=ˈdatɕə|a=ru-dacha.ogg}}) is a seasonal or year-round second home, often located in the [[exurb]]s of [[Russian language|Russian-speaking]] and other [[former Soviet Union|post-Soviet]] countries.<ref name=Brockhaus/> A [[cottage]] ({{lang|ru|коттедж}}, ''{{transl|ru|kottedzh}}'') or [[shack]] serving as a family's main or only home, or an outbuilding, is not considered a dacha,<ref name=Brockhaus/> although some dachas recently have been converted to year-round residences and vice versa.

The word "dacha", coming from "davat" or "give", originally referred to land allotted by the tsar to his nobles; and indeed the dacha in Soviet times is similar to the [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]] in some Western countries – a piece of land allotted, normally free, to citizens by the local government for gardening or growing vegetables for personal consumption. With time the name for the land was applied to the building on it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lexicography.online/etymology/%D0%B4/%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B0|title=Этимология слова дача|website=ΛΓΩ|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref> In some cases, owners occupy their dachas for part of the year and rent them to urban residents as summer retreats. People living in dachas are colloquially called  ''dachniki'' ({{lang|ru|дачники}}); the term usually refers not only to dacha dwellers but to a distinctive lifestyle.<ref name=Summerfolk/> The Russian term is often said to have no exact counterpart in English.<ref name=Mitchell>{{cite journal|journal= Passport Magazine|url= http://www.passportmagazine.ru/article/1893/|title= Summer Dachas: Country Life|first= Ian|last= Mitchell|date= May 2010|location= Moscow}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= Newman|first= Cathy|title= Russian Summer|date= June 2012 |url= http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/07/russian-summer/newman-text |journal= National Geographic |publisher= National Geographic Society|location= Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

Dachas are common in [[Russia]], and are also widespread in most parts of the [[former Soviet Union]] and in some countries of the former [[Eastern Bloc]]. Surveys in 1993–1994 suggest about 25% of Russian families living in large cities had dachas.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Struyk |first1= Raymond J. |last2= Angelici |first2= Karen |year= 1996 |doi= 10.1080/02673039608720854 |title= The Russian Dacha phenomenon |journal= Housing Studies |volume= 11 |issue= 2 |pages= 233–250 | quote = This paper begins to fill the void of information about dachas in Russia by drawing on household surveys conducted in seven cities between November 1993 and January 1994.

Dachniki use their dachas for [[fishing]], [[hunting]], and other leisure activities. Growing garden crops – still seen as an important part of dacha life – remains popular.

Dachas originated as small country estates given as a gift by the [[tsar]], and have been popular among the Russian upper- and middle-classes ever since. During the Soviet era, many dachas were state-owned, and were given to the people. The government of the Russian Federation continues to own State dachas (''{{transl|ru|gosdacha}}'') used by the [[President of Russia|president]] and other officials. They were extremely popular in the Soviet Union.

As regulations severely restricted the size and type of dacha buildings for ordinary people during the Soviet period, permitted features such as large attics or glazed verandas became extremely widespread and often oversized. In the period from the 1960s to 1985 legal limitations were especially strict: only single-story [[summer house]]s without permanent heating and with living areas less than {{convert|60|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}} were allowed as second housing (though older dachas that did not meet these requirements continued to exist). In the 1980s planners loosened the rules, and since 1990 all such limitations have been eliminated.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==History==

=== Origins ===

[[File:Magic_Sankt_Petersburg_-_it's_Datscha_Land_3.jpg|thumb|An old dacha near Saint Petersburg]]
The first dachas in Russia began to appear during the 17th century, initially referring to small estates in the country that were given to loyal vassals by the [[tsar]].<ref name=Summerfolk>{{cite book| last = Lovell|first =Stephen |title= Summerfolk: A History of the Dacha, 1710-2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wr75LM7kD3AC|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2003|isbn= 0801440718}}</ref> In archaic Russian, the word ''dacha'' means ''something given'', from the verb "дать" [dat'] – "to give".<ref name=Brockhaus/> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], Russian aristocracy used their dachas for social and cultural gatherings, which were usually accompanied by [[masquerade ball]]s and [[fireworks]] displays. The coming of the [[Industrial Revolution]] to Russia brought about a rapid growth in the urban population, and wealthy urban residents increasingly desired to escape the heavily polluted cities, at least temporarily.<ref name=Summerfolk/> By the end of the 19th century, the dacha became a favorite summer retreat for the upper and middle classes of Russian society.<ref name=Beumers>{{cite book|title= Pop Culture Russia!: Media, Arts, and Lifestyle|first= Birgit|last= Beumers|pages= 349–350|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Hix8AyteLN8C&pg=PA350|year= 2005|publisher= ABC-CLIO|isbn= 1851094598}}</ref> In the tsarist era, dachas tended to have pleasure gardens, but were not used much for growing food.<ref>{{cite book|last=Caldwell|first=Melissa|title=Dacha Idylls: Living Organically in Russia's Countryside|location=Berkeley|publisher= University of California Press|year=2011|page=40}}</ref> Maxim Gorky wrote a [[novella|novelette]] entitled ''Dachniki'' (1885), about newlywed city-dwellers living a 'simple' summer life of walks in the countryside.

Following the [[Russian Revolution]], most dachas were [[nationalisation|nationalised]]. Some were converted into vacation homes for factory workers, while others, usually of better quality, were distributed among the prominent functionaries of the Communist Party and the newly emerged cultural and scientific elite. All but a few dachas remained the property of the state and the right to use them was usually revoked when a dacha occupant was dismissed or fell out of favour with the rulers of the state. Building new dachas required permission from senior officials and was rarely granted during the early years of the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Lovell|first= Stephen|title=The Making of the Stalin-Era Dacha|journal= The Journal of Modern History |volume=74|issue=2 |year=2002|pages=253–288|doi=10.1086/343408|s2cid= 143201074}}</ref> The seniormost Soviet leaders all had their own dachas, and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s favourite was in [[Gagra]], [[Abkhazia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?storyID=7039 |title=Abkhazia: where Stalin's ghost holds sway|newspaper=The Week|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918220951/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?storyID=7039|archivedate=18 September 2007|last=Walker|first=Shaun}}</ref> New dachas started to be built in larger numbers during the 1930s, and dacha colonies for artists, or soldiers, or various classes of party functionaries, started to form.<ref name=Beumers/>

They had to have not more than {{convert|60|m2|sqft|0|abbr=on}} of living area and be only one story tall.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lovell|first1=John|title=The Shadow of War: Russia and the USSR, 1941 to the present|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons}}</ref> For that reason, they usually had a [[mansard roof]], which was considered by authorities as just a large garret or attic, not a second story.<ref>{{cite book|title= The 'Unmaking' of Soviet Life: Everyday Economies After Socialism | first=Caroline | last=Humphrey | publisher= Cornell University Press | year=2002|isbn= 0801487730 |page=[https://archive.org/details/unmakingofsoviet0000hump/page/187 187] |url=https://archive.org/details/unmakingofsoviet0000hump|url-access= registration }}</ref> Often ill-equipped and without indoor plumbing, dachas were nevertheless a solution for millions of working-class families, to have their own form of summer retreat. Having a piece of land also offered an opportunity for city dwellers to indulge themselves in growing their own fruits and vegetables. In the years before and after [[World War II]], cultivation of garden crops on dacha plots was substantial, because of the failure of the [[collectivization in the Soviet Union|centrally planned Soviet agricultural programme]] to supply enough fresh produce. Many dacha owners grew crops for market. Since then, growing garden crops has been of lesser importance, but continues to be widespread.<ref name=Summerfolk/><ref name=Beumers/> Many Russian dacha owners still see gardening as a key value of ''dachnik'' culture. Keeping historical food shortages in mind, they take great pride in growing their own food rather than buying it at a store.<ref name=Zavisca>{{cite journal|last= Zavisca|first= Jane|title=Contesting Capitalism at the Post-Soviet Dacha: The Meaning of Food Cultivation for Urban Russians|journal=  Slavic Review|volume= 62|issue=4|year=2003|pages= 786–810|jstor= 3185655|doi= 10.2307/3185655}}</ref>

The period after World War II saw moderate growth in dacha development. Since there was no actual law banning the construction of dachas, people began [[squatting|occupying unused plots]] of land near cities and towns, growing gardens and building sheds, huts, and more prominent dwellings that served as dachas. As time passed, the number of squatters grew and the government had no choice but to officially recognise their right to amateur farming. The 1955 legislation introduced a new type of legal person into the [[Law of the Soviet Union|Soviet juridical system]], a gardeners' partnership ({{lang|ru|садоводческое товарищество}}, ''sadovodcheskoye tovarishchestvo''), similar to ''[[community garden]]s'' in other countries. The gardeners' partnership received the right to permanent use of land exclusively for agricultural purposes and permission to connect to public electrical and water supply networks.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|trans-title=Sadovodcheskoye tovarishchestvo|script-title=ru:Садоводческое товарищество|language=Russian|encyclopedia= Sel'sko-khozyaystvennyy entsiklopedicheskiy slovar'|editor=Mesyats, V.

The 1980s saw the peak of the dacha boom, with nearly all affluent families—over a third of families in urban areas—having a dacha of their own.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Russian Culture|contribution=housing, Soviet and post-Soviet|pages=256–258|first=Ilia|last=Utekhin|year=2013|publisher=Routledge |editor=Smorodinskaya, T.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXz2okCSfq8C&q=1980s%20dacha%20boom&pg=PA256|isbn= 978-1136787850}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n19/sheila-fitzpatrick/the-good-old-days|title=The Good Old Days|journal=London Review of Books|volume=25|issue= 19 |date=9 October 2003|pages= 18–20 |first=Sheila|last= Fitzpatrick}}</ref> Dacha houses built since the late 1980s are significantly larger than older ones because legal size restrictions were liberalized, and new dacha areas became fields of relatively big houses on tiny land plots.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://lidenz.ru/russian-dachas/ |title=What You Need To Know About Russian Dachas|publisher=Liden & Denz Intercultural Institute of Languages |first = Zoran|last = Trevisan}}</ref> Tracts between lines of dacha land plots are usually unimproved or improved with crushed stone, and narrow (often about {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} between fences) enough that two cars can hardly pass each other by.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Dachas also started to be found in other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, especially in [[East Germany]], where the concept was unknown before 1945 (but remains quite current, even after [[German reunification]]), and in [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=Brockhaus>{{cite book|title=Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|volume= 26|publisher= F.

=== Post-Soviet ===

Due to the rapid increase in urbanization in Russia, many village houses are currently being sold to be used as dachas.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Many Russian villages now have ''dachniki'' as temporary residents. Some villages have been fully transformed into dacha settlements, while some older dacha settlements often look like more permanent lodgings.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The advantages of purchasing a dacha in a village usually are lower costs, greater land area, and larger distances between houses. The disadvantages may include lower-quality utilities, less security, and typically a farther distance to travel.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The means of transportation for people to get to their dachas, besides cars, are "[[water trams]]", buses, and electric trains (colloquially called "[[elektrichka]]", {{lang|ru|электри́чка}}). Due to the high number of people traveling to dachas during the weekends (especially during the summer), traffic typically builds up around large cities, and [[elektrichka]] and buses are filled to capacity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Dachas have also started appearing in regions of North America known for their high concentrations of immigrants from Russia and Ukraine. Russians and Ukrainians from New York, Long Island, and New Jersey have been retreating to their Russian-style dacha homes in the forests of [[Upstate New York]] in order to recreate the dacha experiences they had during the Soviet era.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Dacha gardens==
{{see also|Household plot}}
[[File:E7159-Kstovo-industrial-right.jpg|300px|thumb|One of many dacha plots surrounding [[Kstovo]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast]]]]
Dacha plots are usually not more than {{convert|600|sqm|abbr=on}} in area; in some cases over {{convert|1200|or|1500|sqm|abbr=on}}, but nearly never exceeding {{convert|0.96|ha|abbr=on}}. They therefore are too small to grow any large amount of fruits and vegetables, thus sometimes they are also grown on separate dedicated plots of ground nearby. In Soviet times and sometimes now, such dedicated plots of ground were often made of the unused sections of agricultural fields owned by [[collective farms]].<ref name=Summerfolk/> Many small dacha plots, especially those that were recently purchased, are not used for large-scale fruit and vegetable farming. Instead, they are frequently used for [[gardening]] and planting exotic plants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Due to custom and the perceived high costs of good equipment, even relatively large plots of land are often cultivated manually using equipment such as a spade or a spading fork.<ref name=Mitchell/><ref name=Clarke/> In autumn the grown potatoes and other crops are gathered and transported to the city where they are stored in cellars, dugouts (usually located on unused plots of ground), or in personal automobile garages.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Many Russians prefer to grow vegetables themselves because of the widespread belief in the excessive use of agrochemicals in the vegetables from supermarkets and grocery stores, and the higher costs of the vegetables in stores and [[bazaar]]s, especially among the older part of the population. Also, growing one's own food supplies is a long-lived Russian tradition practised even by many affluent Russians. It is seen as a way to have a connection to the land, to be self-sufficient, and for many, to find some escape from a capitalist economy.<ref name=Zavisca/>

While a large portion of urban Russians grow some vegetables in their dacha gardens, the perception in some parts of society that urban Russians are becoming increasingly self-sufficient is a myth, and only some 15 percent of vegetables are grown by urban dwellers.<ref name=Clarke>{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Simon |year=2002 |url=http://www.warwick.ac.uk/russia/survival.pdf |title=Making Ends Meet in Contemporary Russia: Secondary Employment, Subsidiary Agriculture and Social Networks |location=Cheltenham, England and Northampton, Massachusetts |publisher=Edward Elgar |isbn=1-84064-262-9 }}</ref>

The most common dacha fruits in cool temperate regions of Russia are [[apple]], [[blackcurrant]], [[redcurrant]], [[gooseberry]], [[raspberry]] and [[strawberry]] (sometimes also [[sour cherry]], [[downy cherry]], [[rose hip]]s, [[plum]], [[Prunus padus|bird cherry]], [[pear]], [[sea-buckthorn]], ''[[Actinidia kolomikta]]'', [[black chokeberry]], [[serviceberry]], [[Berberis vulgaris|barberry]], [[sweetberry honeysuckle]], [[blackberry]] and [[grape]], but many of them are either rare or not hardy enough and require winter protection). Popular vegetables and herbs are [[potato]], [[cucumber]], [[zucchini]], [[pumpkin]], [[tomato]], [[carrot]], [[Bell pepper#Varieties|red bell peppers (capsicum)]], [[beetroot]], [[cabbage]], [[cauliflower]], [[radish]], [[turnip]], [[onion]], [[garlic]], [[dill]], [[parsley]], [[rhubarb]], [[sorrel]], [[papaver]], [[Jerusalem artichoke|earth apple]], [[horseradish]] and others. {{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Dachas and crimes==

Theft is not an unusual happening for dachas. Usually, the dachas are either not under surveillance at all or there is only one single guard taking care of the entire property. Trying to prevent these thefts, dacha owners take everything valuable back to their apartments in the city at the end of summer. Most of all, dishes, tools and clothes are stolen. It often occurs that homeless people and criminals use the dachas in autumn and winter in the absence of the respective owners.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Политические перетасовки - Призыв|url=http://www.prizyv.ru/politic/?news=2474|work=Призыв|date=2013-10-17|accessdate=2018-03-08|language=ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=2009-05-17|url=http://newsru.com/russia/17may2009/ha.html|title=Сахалинский чиновник, на которого напал голодный бомж, умер от ран|publisher=[[NEWSru]]|accessdate=2010-08-13}}</ref>
