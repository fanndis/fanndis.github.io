For two years from [[Malawi]]'s independence in 1964, the country was a monarchy with [[Elizabeth II]] as its queen. She was also the Sovereign of the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, including the [[United Kingdom]]. The 1964 Constitution of Malawi vested executive power in the Queen, as [[head of state]], though her constitutional roles were delegated to her representative, the [[List of Governors-General of Malawi|Governor-General]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Simon Roberts|title=The Constitution of Malawi, 1964|journal=Journal of African Law|volume=8|issue=3|date=Autumn 1964|pages=178–184|doi=10.1017/S0021855300007282}}</ref>

Malawi was granted independence by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]'s Malawi Independence Act 1964, which transformed the [[Nyasaland|Protectorate of Nyasaland]] into an independent [[sovereign state]] called [[Malawi (1964–1966)|Malawi]].

The roles of the Queen and the Governor-General in Malawi were abolished on 6 July 1966, when Malawi became a [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|republic within the Commonwealth]], with the [[President of Malawi]] as [[head of state]].

The Queen visited Malawi 22–25 July 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/RoyalVisits/Commonwealthvisitssince1952.aspx|title=Commonwealth visits since 1952|publisher=Royal Household|work=Official website of the British monarchy|accessdate=8 November 2015}}</ref> The Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in [[Blantyre]] was opened in 1958<ref>{{cite book|author=John McCracken|date=2012|title=A History of Malawi, 1859–1966|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsA99MJ13t0C&pg=PA261|page=261|isbn=978-1-84701-050-6}}</ref> and is the largest hospital in Malawi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earnest.cineca.org/blantyre.html|title=The Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi|publisher=The Europe - Africa Research Network for Evaluation of Second-line Therapy (EARNEST)|accessdate=8 November 2015}}</ref>
