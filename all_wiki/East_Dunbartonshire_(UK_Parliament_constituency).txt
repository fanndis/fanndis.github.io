'''East Dunbartonshire''' is a [[county constituency]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] ([[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]). It elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election. The seat is best known for formerly being the constituency of [[Jo Swinson]], the former leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. The current MP for the constituency is the [[Scottish National Party]]'s [[Amy Callaghan]].

The current constituency was first used at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]]. There was also an earlier East Dunbartonshire constituency, from 1950–83.

==Constituency profile==
The constituency covers the northern edge of Greater Glasgow, and includes commuter towns on the [[North Clyde Line|North Clyde]] and [[Croy Line|Croy]] railway corridors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/general-election/constituency-profile-lib-dems-pin-hopes-on-east-dunbartonshire-1-4466623|title=Constituency profile: Lib Dems pin hopes on East Dunbartonshire|website=www.scotsman.com}}</ref>

Since 1974 the constituency has been represented by all four of the main political parties in Scotland.

=== Current ===
The existing constituency was created as a result of the Fifth Periodical Review of the [[Boundary Commission for Scotland]], as one of two covering the [[East Dunbartonshire council area]] and one of five covering the East Dunbartonshire council area and the [[North Lanarkshire council area]].<ref name="5th Review">''[http://www.bcomm-scotland.gov.uk/ Boundary Commission for Scotland website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921124603/http://www.bcomm-scotland.gov.uk/ |date=September 21, 2007 }}''</ref>

The East Dunbartonshire constituency is entirely within the East Dunbartonshire council area, and the rest of the council area is covered by the [[Cumbernauld, Kilsyth, and Kirkintilloch East (UK Parliament constituency)|Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East]] constituency, which also covers part of the North Lanarkshire council area. The rest of the North Lanarkshire area is covered by the [[Airdrie and Shotts (UK Parliament constituency)|Airdrie and Shotts]], [[Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (UK Parliament constituency)|Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill]],  and  [[Motherwell and Wishaw (UK Parliament constituency)|Motherwell and Wishaw]] constituencies.<ref name="5th Review"/>

The East Dunbartonshire constituency replaced most of the [[Strathkelvin and Bearsden (UK Parliament constituency)|Strathkelvin and Bearsden]] constituency and some of the [[Clydebank and Milngavie (UK Parliament constituency)|Clydebank and Milngavie]] constituency and some of the [[Coatbridge and Chryston (UK Parliament constituency)|Coatbridge and Chryston]] constituency.<ref name="5th Review"/>

The Fifth Periodical Review did not affect the boundaries of [[Scottish Parliament constituencies]], which retain the boundaries of Westminster constituencies prior to implementation of the results of the review.

=== Historic ===
The historic constituency was created under the [[House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949]], and first used in the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]].<ref name="Graig">''[[Boundaries of Parliamentary Constituencies 1885-1972]]'' ({{ISBN|0-900178-09-4}}), [[F. W. S. Craig]], 1972</ref>

As created in 1950, the constituency was one of two covering the [[county of Dunbarton]]. The other was [[West Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Dunbartonshire]]. The two new constituencies replaced the earlier constituencies of [[Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunbartonshire]] and [[Dumbarton Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumbarton Burghs]].<ref name="Graig"/>

East Dunbartonshire covered the Cumbernauld, Kirkintilloch, and New Kilpatrick districts of the [[Counties of Scotland|county]] and the [[burgh]]s of [[Clydebank]], [[Kirkintilloch]], and [[Milngavie]].<ref name="Graig"/>

For the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]] the constituency boundaries were adjusted to take account of a change to the boundaries of the burgh of Clydebank.<ref name="Graig"/>

The results of the First Periodical Review of the [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|Boundary Commission]] were implemented for the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]], but there was no change to the boundaries of East Dunbartonshire, and the boundaries of 1951 and 1955 were used also in the [[United Kingdom general elections|general election]]s of [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]], [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]], [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]] and [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]].<ref name="Graig"/>

The results of the Second Periodical Review were implemented for the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]]. The review took account of population growth in the county of Dunbarton, caused by overspill from the city of [[Glasgow]] into the new town of [[Cumbernauld, Dunbartonshire|Cumbernauld]] and elsewhere,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} and East Dunbartonshire became one of three constituencies covering the county. East Dunbartonshire now covered the Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld districts of the county and the burghs of [[Bearsden]], Cumbernauld, and Kirkintilloch, but it lost [[Clydebank]] and [[Milngavie]] to the new constituency of [[Central Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Central Dunbartonshire]].  These boundaries were used also for the general elections of [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] and [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In 1975, under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], Scottish counties were abolished in favour of [[Regions and districts of Scotland|regions and districts]] and [[Islands council areas of Scotland|islands council areas]], and the county of  Dunbarton was divided between several districts of the new [[region of Strathclyde]]. The Third Periodical Review took account of new [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] boundaries, and the results were implemented for the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

The constituency of 1950 to 1983 has an unusual electoral history, in that in two consecutive general elections it was gained by the party in third place at the previous election. In October 1974 the SNP leapfrogged Labour to defeat the Conservatives, and in 1979 Labour leapfrogged the Conservatives to beat the SNP. Furthermore, the constituency went the opposite way to the nation in two consecutive changes of government.  In February 1974, the Conservatives gained it from Labour, though losing nationally, while in 1979 Labour regained the seat from the SNP, though losing nationally. Apart from [[Ynys Môn (UK Parliament constituency)|Ynys Môn]] in Wales, East Dunbartonshire is the only seat to have been represented by the three main parties and the nationalists.
