==History==
[[File:Radio.com logo.png|Radio.com logo used 2017-2018.|left|thumb|150px]]
The RADIO.COM domain was formerly owned by [[CNET|CNET Networks]], which purchased it and [[TV.com|tv.com]] from the nonprofit Internet Multicasting Service for $30,000 in 1996.<ref name="cw-radio.comcnet">{{cite news |last1=Nash |first1=Kim S. |title=Dueling for domains |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CKP7BLzPgf8C&q=CNET%20Computerworld%20radio.com%201996&pg=PA61 |accessdate=November 6, 2018 |work=[[Computerworld]] |date=September 30, 1996 |pages=61, 64}}</ref> CNET, and in turn the radio.com domain, was acquired by [[CBS Corporation]] (the parent company of CBS Radio at the time) in 2008.<ref name="gigaom-radio.comcnet">{{cite news |last1=Kramer |first1=Staci D. |title=CBS-CNET: CBS Will Own TV.com, Radio.com, MP3.com and News.com |url=https://gigaom.com/2008/05/15/419-cbs-cnet-cbs-will-own-tvcom-radiocom-mp3com-and-newsco/ |accessdate=November 6, 2018 |work=[[Gigaom]] |date=May 15, 2008}}</ref>

RADIO.COM launched on July 16, 2010 under CBS Radio. It was originally launched as a central website to stream all of CBS's then 130 radio stations, [[Last.fm]] and other CBS properties. Among the original features were currently playing information, song history, station and genre searches, presets, blogs, newsfeeds, and social media tools.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.adweek.com/digital/cbs-radio-launches-new-online-player-115775/|title=CBS Radio Launches New Online Player|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}</ref> Later that year the service launched its first app for [[iOS]]. In addition the service added custom channels and music from [[AOL Radio]] and [[Yahoo Music]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://detroit.cbslocal.com/2010/12/06/cbs-radio-launches-radio-com-app-for-iphone/|title=CBS Radio Launches Radio.com App For iPhone|date=2010-12-06|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en}}{{Secondary source needed|date=July 2018}}</ref> In 2015, the service added a music video streaming option.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/cbs-radio-com-partners-with-looped-to-stream-music-videos-online/|title=CBS' Radio.com Launches Streaming Music Videos|date=2015-12-02|work=TheWrap|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}</ref> These deals eventually ended quietly, especially after AOL and Yahoo's mergers into [[Oath Inc.|Oath]].

Entercom acquired CBS Radio, including RADIO.COM, on November 17, 2017.

Throughout early and mid-2018, disparate individual mobile apps and sites for Entercom's legacy stations (sometimes developed outside Entercom by local third parties for individual stations, and often not being hosted universally by one provider) were withdrawn from the [[iTunes Store]] and [[Google Play]], uniting all of Entercom's web and mobile efforts for their properties solely under the RADIO.COM app and website. The CBS Radio stations, which were part of "CBS Local" sites with their former sister television stations, also saw their main web presences moved to sub-domains of RADIO.COM.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.insideradio.com/free/radio-com-expands-to-include-entercom-roster-and-then-some/article_61f59c18-cea0-11e7-b7a1-a7db68e2dc25.html|title=Radio.Com Expands To Include Entercom Roster – And Then Some.|date=21 November 2017|work=Inside Radio|accessdate=16 February 2019}}</ref>

On June 25, 2018, Entercom announced that RADIO.COM would become the exclusive streaming provider for all of its stations, ending its relationship with the third-party service [[TuneIn]]. Stations previously owned by Entercom pre-merger were removed July 6, and former CBS Radio stations were removed on August 1. At that time, Entercom's stations would also begin promoting the service, in particular suffixing "a RADIO.COM station" after their legal [[station identification]]s at the top of each hour. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbr.com/tunein-tune-out-for-entercom-radio-com-gets-exclusive/|title=TuneIn Tune Out For Entercom: Radio.com Gets Exclusive|website= Radio & Television Business Report|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-21}}</ref> [[Smart speaker]] integration of the service was launched within the same period.

On February 7, 2019, Entercom launched stations for [[CNN]], [[CNN International]], [[HLN (TV network)|HLN]], [[Bloomberg Radio]] and [[Bloomberg Television]] on Radio.com along with podcasts from [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Podcast Network]] via deals with [[Bloomberg L.P.]] and [[Turner Broadcasting]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://radioink.com/2019/02/07/radio-com-to-launch-stations-for-cnn-bloomberg/|title=Radio.com To Launch Stations For CNN, Bloomberg|last=Ink|first=Radio|date=2019-02-07|website=Radio Ink|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref> Two weeks later, Radio.com reached deals to add [[Bonneville International]] and [[Cox Radio|Cox Media Group]] stations and podcasts to the platform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/173905/is-radio-com-expanding-beyond-entercom-stations/|title=Radio.com Adds Bonneville & Cox Stations To Streaming Platform|date=2019-02-22|website=RadioInsight|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref>

On September 25, 2019, [[Salem Media Group]] and [[Alpha Media]] joined the RADIO.COM platform.<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/180716/alpha-media-salem-media-group-stations-to-join-radio-com/ Alpha Media & Salem Media Group Stations To Join Radio.com] - Radio insight (published September 25, 2019)</ref>

In October 2019, the app debuted a feature called "Rewind", where a number of Entercom's spoken word content stations maintain a 24-hour on-demand buffer of programming that can be accessed through rewind, fast-forward and skip back/forward controls.

On November 25, 2019, [[Disney Channels Worldwide]] agreed to terms to feature [[Radio Disney]] and Radio Disney Country's streams on RADIO.COM.<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/181985/radio-disney-joins-radio-com/ Radio Disney Joins Radio.com] - Radio Insight (published November 25, 2019)</ref>

==Availability and supported devices==
In addition to traditional desktop availability, the service is available via [[iOS]]/[[WatchOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile and tablet devices, along with [[Amazon Alexa]] and [[Google Assistant]]-compatible [[smart speaker]]s and other devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.radio.com/blogs/how-listen-radio-stations-online-radiocom-faq|title=How to listen to radio stations online at Radio.com: FAQ|publisher=Radio.com|accessdate=10 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/googlehome/LQXQ-_wxIGM;context-place=topicsearchin/googlehome/category$3Aask-a-how-to-question%7Csort:relevance%7Cspell:false|title=Google Groups|work=[[Google Search]]|accessdate=10 August 2018}}</ref>

Holding to CBS Radio's longtime policy, streaming of RADIO.COM  content is geo-restricted to the United States. In addition, local advertising from the advertisers of the nearest Entercom cluster of stations to a listener is substituted over a station's own advertising, along with traditional national advertising, [[public service announcement]]s, and RADIO.COM features such as music news, trivia, and other minutia.
