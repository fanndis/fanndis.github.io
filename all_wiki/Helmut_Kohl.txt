'''Helmut Josef Michael Kohl''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɛlmuːt ˈkoːl|lang}}; 3 April 1930 – 16 June 2017) was a German statesman and politician of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) who served as [[Chancellor of Germany]] from 1982 to 1998 (of [[West Germany]], 1982–1990; and of [[reunified Germany]], 1990–1998) and as chairman of the CDU from 1973 to 1998. As Chancellor, Kohl was strongly committed to [[European integration]] and [[France–Germany relations|French–German cooperation]] in particular; he was also a steadfast ally of the [[United States]] and supported [[Reagan]]'s more aggressive policies in order to weaken the [[Soviet Union]]. Kohl's 16-year tenure is the longest of any German Chancellor since [[Otto von Bismarck]].{{efn| He oversaw the end of the [[Cold War]] and the [[German reunification]], for which he is generally known as ''Chancellor of Unity''. Together with French President [[François Mitterrand]], Kohl was the architect of the [[Maastricht Treaty]], which established the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[Euro]] currency,<ref name="chambers">{{cite book |first=Mortimer |last=Chambers |date=2010 |title=The Western Experience |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |edition=10th |isbn=978-0-07-729117-4 |oclc=320804011}} {{page needed|date=June 2017}}</ref> and in 1988 both received the [[Charlemagne Prize]].

Born in 1930 in [[Ludwigshafen]] to a [[Roman Catholic]] family, Kohl joined the Christian Democratic Union in 1946 at the age of 16. He earned a PhD in history at [[Heidelberg University]] in 1958 and worked as a business executive before becoming a full-time politician. He was elected as the youngest member of the [[Landtag of Rhineland-Palatinate|Parliament of Rhineland-Palatinate]] in 1959 and from 1969 to 1976 was [[Minister-president|minister president]] of the [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] state. Viewed during the 1960s and the early 1970s as a progressive within the CDU, he was elected national chairman of the party in 1973. In the [[1976 West German federal election|1976 federal election]] his party performed well, but the social-liberal government of social democrat [[Helmut Schmidt]] was able to remain in power, as well as in [[1980 West German federal election|1980]], when Kohl's rival from the Bavarian sister party [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]], [[Franz Josef Strauß]], was the [[CDU/CSU]] candidate. After Schmidt had lost the support of the liberal [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] in 1982, Kohl was elected Chancellor through a switch of the FDP, forming a Christian-liberal government. After he had become party leader, Kohl was increasingly seen as a more conservative figure. Kohl chaired the [[Group of Seven]] in 1985 and 1992. In 1998 he became honorary chairman of the CDU, resigning from the position in 2000.

Kohl was also a central figure in the [[Enlargement of the European Union|eastern enlargement of the European Union]], and his government led the effort to push for international recognition of [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] when the states declared independence. He played an instrumental role in solving the [[Bosnian War]]. Domestically, Kohl's policies focused on economic reforms and later also on the process of integrating former East Germany into reunified Germany, and he moved the federal capital from the "provisional capital" [[Bonn]] back to [[Berlin]], although he himself never resided there because the government offices were only relocated in 1999. Kohl also greatly increased federal spending on arts and culture. After his chancellorship, Kohl's reputation suffered domestically because of his role in the [[CDU donations scandal]] and he had to resign from his honorary chairmanship of the CDU after little more than a year in January 2000, but he was partly rehabilitated in later years. The later Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] started her political career as Kohl's protegée.

Kohl was married to [[Hannelore Kohl]] during his entire political career, and they had two sons, [[Walter Kohl]] and [[Peter Kohl]]. Following [[Death and funeral of Helmut Kohl|his death]], Kohl was honoured with the [[European act of state in honour of Helmut Kohl|first-ever European act of state]] in [[Strasbourg]].<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/late-german-chancellor-helmut-kohl-to-be-honored-with-special-european-commemoration/a-39296729|title=Late German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to be honored with special European commemoration – News – DW – 18.06.2017|website=DW.COM}}</ref>

== Life ==
=== Youth and education ===
Helmut Kohl was born on 3 April 1930 in [[Ludwigshafen]] am Rhein (then in Bavaria, now in Rhineland-Palatinate). He was the third child of Hans Kohl (6 January 1887 – 20 October 1975),<ref>{{cite book|title=Helmut Kohl: Virtuose der Macht|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHMsAQAAIAAJ&q=Hans+Kohl+6.+Januar+1887+–+20.+Oktober+1975|page=11|first1=Heribert|last1=Schwan|first2=Rolf|last2=Steininger|publisher=Artemis & Winkler|date=2010|isbn=9783538072725}}</ref> a [[Bavarian army]] veteran and civil servant, and his wife, Cäcilie (née Schnur; 17 November 1891 – 2 August 1979).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Cäcilie-Kohl/6000000060816276910|title=Cäcilie Kohl|website=www.geni.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Helmut Josef Michael Kohl|url=http://www.helmut-kohl.de/helmut_josef_michael_kohl.html|website=Helmut-kohl.de|publisher=Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung|access-date=11 June 2015|language=de}}</ref>

Kohl's family was conservative and Roman Catholic, and remained loyal to the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]] before and after 1933. His elder brother died in [[World War II]] as a teenage soldier. At the age of ten, Kohl was obliged, like most children in Germany at the time, to join the ''[[Deutsches Jungvolk]]'', a section of the [[Hitler Youth]]. Aged 15, on 20 April 1945, Kohl was sworn into the Hitler Youth by leader [[Artur Axmann]] at [[Berchtesgaden]], just days before the end of the war, as membership was mandatory for all boys of his age. Kohl was also [[conscription|drafted]] for military service in 1945; he was not involved in any combat, a fact he later referred to as the "mercy of late birth" (German: ''Gnade der späten Geburt'').{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|pages=42–43}}

Kohl attended the Ruprecht Elementary School, and continued at the Max-Planck-Gymnasium.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=38}} After graduating in 1950, Kohl began to study law in [[Frankfurt]] am Main, spending two semesters commuting between Ludwigshafen and Frankfurt.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=62}} Here, Kohl heard lectures from [[Carlo Schmid (German politician)|Carlo Schmid]] and [[Walter Hallstein]], among others.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=63}} In 1951, Kohl switched to [[Heidelberg University]], where he studied history and [[political science]]. Kohl was the first in his family to attend university.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|pp=61–62}}

=== Life before politics ===
After graduating in 1956, Kohl became a fellow at the Alfred Weber Institute of Heidelberg University under [[Dolf Sternberger]]{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=64}} where he was an active member of the student society [[AIESEC]].<ref>{{cite web |title=60 Years AIESEC: Thinking Globally, Acting Socially |url=https://www.kit.edu/kit/english/pi_2013_13577.php |website=kit.edu |access-date=10 June 2015 |date=27 June 2013}}</ref> In 1958, Kohl received his doctorate degree in history for his dissertation ''Die politische Entwicklung in der Pfalz und das Wiedererstehen der Parteien nach 1945'' ("The Political Developments in the Palatinate and the Reconstruction of Political Parties after 1945"), under the supervision of the historian [[Walther Peter Fuchs]].{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|pages=68–69}} After that, Kohl entered business, first as an assistant to the director of a foundry in Ludwigshafen,{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=90}} then, in April 1960, as a manager for the Industrial Union for Chemistry in Ludwigshafen.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=90}}

=== Early political career ===
In 1946, Kohl joined the recently founded [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]],{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=52}} becoming a full member once he turned 18 in 1948.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=57}} In 1947, Kohl was one of the co-founders of the [[Junge Union]]-branch in Ludwigshafen, the CDU youth organisation.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=57}} In 1953, Kohl joined the board of the Palatinate branch of the CDU. In 1954, Kohl became vice-chair of the Junge Union in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]],<ref name=fruehejahre>{{cite web |title=Jugendjahre und erste politische Erfahrungen 1930–1959 |url=http://www.helmut-kohl.de/jugendjahre.html |website=helmut-kohl.de |access-date=18 June 2015 |language=de}}</ref> being a member of the board until 1961.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=74}}

In January 1955, Kohl ran for a seat on the board of the Rhineland-Palatinate CDU, losing just narrowly to the state's Minister of Family Affairs, [[Franz-Josef Wuermeling]].<ref name=fruehejahre /> Kohl was still able to take up a seat on the board, being sent there by his local party branch as a delegate.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=75}} During his early years in the party, Kohl aimed to open it towards the young generation, turning away from a close relationship with the churches.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|pages=78–80}}

[[File:KAS-Kohl, Helmut-Bild-6906-3.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.7|left|Kohl as the CDU [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] state party chairman]]
In early 1959, Kohl was elected chairman of the Ludwigshafen district branch of the CDU, as well as candidate for the upcoming state elections. On 19 April 1959, Kohl was elected as the youngest member of the state diet, the [[Landtag of Rhineland-Palatinate]].{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|pages=91–92}} In 1960, he was also elected to the municipal council of Ludwigshafen where he served as leader of the CDU party until 1969.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=93}} When the chairman of the CDU parliamentary group in the Landtag, [[Wilhelm Boden]], died in late 1961, Kohl moved up into a deputy position. Following the next state election in 1963, he took over as chairman, a position he held until he became Minister-President in 1969.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|pages=98–99}} In 1966, Kohl and the incumbent minister-president and state party chairman, [[Peter Altmeier]], agreed to share duties. In March 1966, Kohl was elected as chairman of the party in Rhineland-Palatinate, while Altmeier once again ran for minister-president in the state elections in 1967, agreeing to hand the post over to Kohl after two years, halfway into the legislative period.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=103}}

=== Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F028914-0002, Ludwigshafen, CDU-Kongress, Helmut Kohl.jpg|thumb|Helmut Kohl, 1969]]
Kohl was elected minister-president of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] on 19 May 1969, as the successor to [[Peter Altmeier]]. As of 2017, he was the youngest person ever to be elected as head of government in a German ''Bundesland''.<ref name=swr>{{cite web |title=Kohl – der Reformer |url=http://www.swr.de/archiv/diekohlstory/biografie-der-junge-wilde-mischt-die-partei-auf/kohl-der-reformer/-/id=6008018/did=6011708/mpdid=6115530/nid=6008018/fxq4r7/index.html |publisher=SWR |access-date=18 June 2015 |language=de |date=12 March 2010}}</ref> Just a few days after his election as minister-president, Kohl also became vice-chair of the federal CDU party.<ref name=swr /> While in office, Kohl acted as a reformer, focusing on school and education. His government abolished [[school corporal punishment]] and the [[parochial school]], topics that had been controversial with the conservative wing of his party.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|pages=101–114}}<ref name=swr /> During his term, Kohl founded the [[University of Kaiserslautern|University of Trier-Kaiserslautern]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vogel |first1=Bernhard |title=Wie alles begann: Die Gründung der Universität Trier-Kaiserslautern vor 40 Jahren |url=https://www.uni-trier.de/fileadmin/organisation/Presse/andere_Publikationen/Reden-40_Jahre_01.pdf |publisher=Universität Trier |access-date=26 June 2015 |language=de |year=2010}}</ref> He also finalised a territorial reform of the state, standardising codes of law and re-aligning districts, an act that he had already pursued under Altmeier's tenure, taking the chairmanship of the Landtag's committee on the reform.<ref name=swr />{{sfn|Köhler|2014|pages=126–127}} After taking office, Kohl established two new ministries, one for economy and transportation and one for social matters, with the latter going to [[Heiner Geißler]], who would work closely with Kohl for the next twenty years.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=104}}

=== Federal party level, election as chairman of the CDU ===
Kohl moved up into the federal board (''Vorstand'') of the CDU in 1964.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=139}} Two years later, shortly before his election as chairman of the party in Rhineland-Palatinate, he failed at an attempt to be voted into the executive committee (''Präsidium'') of the party.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=144}} After the CDU lost its involvement in the federal government for the first time since the end of [[World War II]] in the [[1969 West German federal election|1969 election]], Kohl was elected into the committee.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=156}} While former chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]] remained chairman of the CDU until 1971, it was now parliamentary chairman [[Rainer Barzel]] who led the opposition against the newly formed social-liberal coalition of [[Willy Brandt]].{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=157}}

As a member of the board and the executive committee, Kohl pushed towards a party reform, supporting liberal stances in education and social policies, including employee participation. When a proposal by the board was put to vote at a party convention in early 1971 in [[Düsseldorf]], Kohl was unable to prevail against protest coming from the conservative wing of the party around [[Alfred Dregger]] and the sister party [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]], costing him support at the liberal wing of the party. To make matters worse, in a mistake during the voting process, Kohl himself voted against the proposal, further angering his supporters, such as party treasurer [[Walther Leisler Kiep]].{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|pages=158–159}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F041437-0013, Hamburg, CDU-Bundesparteitag, Helmut Kohl.jpg|thumb|Kohl at the CDU national party convention in [[Hamburg]] in 1973]]
Nevertheless, when Kiesinger stepped down as party chairman in 1971, Kohl was a candidate for his succession. He was unsuccessful, losing the vote to Barzel 344 to 174.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=162}} In April 1972, in the light of Brandt's ''[[Ostpolitik]]'', the CDU aimed to depose Brandt and his government in a [[constructive vote of no confidence]], replacing him with Barzel. The attempt failed, as two members of the opposition voted against Barzel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zwei Stimmen fehlten der Opposition|url=http://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2012/38507921_kw17_misstrauensvotum_brandt/208272|publisher=Deutscher Bundestag|access-date=26 June 2015|language=de|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Saxon|first1=Wolfgang|title=Rainer Barzel, 82, Force in Postwar Germany, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/30/world/europe/30BARZEL.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=26 June 2015|date=30 August 2006}}</ref> After Barzel also lost the [[1972 West German federal election|general election later that year]], the path was free for Kohl to take over. After Barzel announced on 10 May 1973 that he would not run for the post of party chairman again, Kohl succeeded him at a party convention in [[Bonn]] on 12 June 1973, amassing 520 of 600 votes, with him as the only candidate.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|pages=164–165}} Facing stiff opposition from the left wing of the party, Kohl initially expected only to serve as chairman for a couple of months, as his critics planned to replace him at another convention set for November in [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Köhler|2014|p=215}} Kohl received the support of his party and remained in office, not least due to the lauded work of [[Kurt Biedenkopf]], whom Kohl had brought in as Secretary General of the CDU.{{sfn|Köhler|2014|pages=218–222}} Kohl remained chairman until 1998.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=166}}

When chancellor Brandt stepped down in May 1974 following the unravelling of the [[Guillaume Affair]], Kohl urged his party to restrain from ''[[Schadenfreude]]'' and not to use the position of their political opponent for "cheap polemics".{{sfn|Köhler|2014|pages=223–224}} In June, Kohl campaigned during the state elections in [[Lower Saxony]] for his party colleague [[Wilfried Hasselmann]], leading the CDU to a strong result of 48.8% of the vote, even though it proved not enough to prevent a continuation of the social-liberal coalition in the state.{{sfn|Köhler|2014|p=226}}

=== First candidacy for the chancellorship and the 1976 Bundestag election ===
On 9 March 1975, Kohl and the CDU faced re-election in Rhineland-Palatinate. What placed Kohl, who intended to run for chancellor, under increased pressure was the fact that the sister parties of CDU and CSU were set to decide upon their leading candidate for the [[1976 West German federal election|upcoming federal elections]] in mid-1975. CSU chairman [[Franz Josef Strauß]] had ambitions to run and publicly put Kohl under pressure over what a result would be acceptable in the state elections. On election day, the CDU achieved a result of 53.9 per cent, the highest ever result in the state, consolidating Kohl's position. Strauß' bid for the chancellorship was further put into jeopardy when in March 1975 the magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' published a transcript of a speech held in November 1974, in which Strauß claimed that the [[Red Army Faction]], a West German armed struggle group responsible for multiple attacks at the time, had sympathizers in the ranks of the SPD and FDP. The scandal deeply unsettled the public and effectively ruled out Strauß for the candidacy.{{sfn|Köhler|2014|pages=232–234}}

On 12 May 1975, the federal board of the CDU unanimously nominated Kohl as the candidate for the general elections, without consulting their Bavarian sister party beforehand. In reaction, the CSU nominated Strauß and only a mediation by former chancellor Kiesinger was able to resolve the issue and confirm Kohl as the candidate for both parties.{{sfn|Köhler|2014|p=236}} In June 1975, Kohl was also re-elected as party chairman, achieving a result of 98.44 per cent.{{sfn|Köhler|2014|p=237}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F049283-0016, Berlin, CDU Bundestagswahlkampf, Kohl.jpg|thumb|Kohl in [[West Berlin|Berlin]] at a campaign event for the [[1976 West German federal election]]]]
Strauß took the discord as a starting point to evaluate chances of expanding the CSU on the federal level, such as having separate electoral lists in the states of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Lower Saxony, Hamburg, and [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]]. He hoped to draw away right-wing voters from the FDP towards the CSU and went as far as having private meetings with industrialists in North Rhine-Westphalia. These attempts led to discomfort within the membership base of the CDU and hampered both parties' chances in the upcoming elections. Kohl himself remained silent during these tensions, which some interpreted as a lack of leadership, while others such as future president [[Karl Carstens]] praised him for seeking a consensus at the centre of the party.{{sfn|Köhler|2014|pages=242–244}} In the 1976 federal election, the CDU/CSU coalition performed very well, winning 48.6% of the vote. They were kept out of government by the center-left cabinet formed by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], led by Social Democrat [[Helmut Schmidt]]. Kohl then retired as minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate to become the leader of the CDU/CSU in the [[Bundestag]]. He was succeeded by Bernhard Vogel.<ref>"Regierungen in Rheinland-Pfalz," in ''Wahlergebnisse in Deutschland'', p. 41, Forschungsgruppe Wahlen, 2005</ref>

=== Leader of the opposition ===
In the [[1980 German federal election|1980 federal elections]], Kohl had to play second fiddle, when CSU-leader [[Franz Josef Strauß]] became the CDU/CSU's candidate for chancellor. Strauß was also unable to defeat the coalition of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP). Unlike Kohl, Strauß did not want to continue as the leader of the CDU/CSU and remained Minister-President of [[Bavaria]]. Kohl remained as leader of the opposition, under the third Schmidt cabinet (1980–82). On 17 September 1982, a conflict of economic policy occurred between the governing SPD/FDP coalition partners. The FDP wanted to radically liberalise the labour market, while the SPD preferred greater job security. The FDP began talks with the CDU/CSU to form a new government.<ref>Mary Fulbrook, ''A History of Germany 1918–2014: The Divided Nation'', p. 176, John Wiley & Sons, 2014, {{ISBN|9781118776131}}</ref>

== Chancellor of West Germany ==
=== Rise to power ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F064809-0010, CDU Bundestagswahlkampf, Kohl.jpg|thumb|left|Kohl at a campaign event for the [[1983 West German federal election]]]]
On 1 October 1982, the CDU proposed a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] which was supported by the FDP. The motion carried. Three days later, the Bundestag voted in a [[Cabinet Kohl I|new CDU/CSU-FDP coalition cabinet]], with Kohl as chancellor. Many of the important details of the new coalition had been hammered out on 20 September, though minor details were reportedly still being hammered out as the vote took place. Though Kohl's election was done according to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], it came amid some controversy.  The FDP had fought its 1980 campaign on the side of the SPD and even placed Chancellor Schmidt on some of their campaign posters. There were also doubts that the new government had the support of a majority of the people. In answer, the new government aimed at new elections at the earliest possible date.  Polls suggested that a clear majority was indeed in reach.  As the Basic Law only allows the dissolution of parliament after an unsuccessful confidence motion, Kohl had to take another controversial move: he called for a confidence vote only a month after being sworn in, which he intentionally lost because the members of his coalition abstained. President [[Karl Carstens]] then dissolved the Bundestag at Kohl's request and called new elections.<ref name="Roberts">Geoffrey K. Roberts, "Outcomes of the Bundestag elections 1949–2005", in ''German politics today'', Oxford University Press, 2013, {{ISBN|9781847794062}}</ref>

The move was controversial, as the coalition parties denied their votes to the same man they had elected Chancellor a month before and whom they wanted to re-elect after the parliamentary election. However, this step was condoned by the German [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] as a legal instrument, and was again applied by SPD Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] in 2005.<ref name="Roberts" />

=== Second cabinet ===
In the [[1983 West German federal election|federal elections of March 1983]], Kohl won a resounding victory. The CDU/CSU won 48.8%, while the FDP won 7.0%. Some opposition members of the Bundestag asked the Federal Constitutional Court to declare the whole proceeding unconstitutional. It denied their claim, but did set restrictions on a similar move in the future. The [[Cabinet Kohl II|second Kohl cabinet]] pushed through several controversial plans, including the stationing of [[NATO]] midrange missiles, against major opposition from the peace movement.<ref>Jeffrey A. Engel, ''The Fall of the Berlin Wall: The Revolutionary Legacy of 1989'', p. 47, Oxford University Press, 2011, {{ISBN|9780199832446}}</ref>

On 22 September 1984, Kohl met the French president [[François Mitterrand]] at [[Verdun]], where the [[Battle of Verdun]] between France and Germany had taken place during World War I. Together, they commemorated the deaths of both World Wars. The photograph, which depicted their minutes long handshake became an important symbol of French-German reconciliation. Kohl and Mitterrand developed a close political relationship, forming an important motor for [[European integration]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=van Hoef |first=Yuri |title=Friendship in world politics: Assessing the personal relationships between Kohl and Mitterrand, and Bush and Gorbachev |url=https://amityjournal.leeds.ac.uk/ |journal=Amity: The Journal of Friendship Studies |volume=3:1 |pages=72–75 }}</ref> Together they laid the foundations for European projects, like [[Eurocorps]] and [[Arte]]. In 1985, alongside European leaders from 16 other countries, they founded [[Eureka (organisation)|Eureka]]: a research and development network of national funding ministries and agencies (distinct from the European Union) that fund and support collaborative international projects. This French-German cooperation also was vital for important European projects, like the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] and the Euro.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dedman|first=Martin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOupcX3KywgC&q=cooperation+mitterand+kohl|title=The Origins and Development of the European Union 1945-2008: A History of European Integration|date=2010|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-43560-4|language=en}}</ref>

In 1985, Kohl and U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], as part of a plan to observe the 40th anniversary of [[V-E Day]], saw an opportunity to demonstrate the strength of the friendship that existed between Germany and its former foe. During a November 1984 visit to the White House, Kohl appealed to Reagan to join him in symbolising the reconciliation of their two countries at a German military cemetery. As Reagan visited Germany as part of the [[11th G7 summit]] in Bonn, the pair visited [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] on 5 May and, controversially, the [[Bitburg controversy|German military cemetery at Bitburg]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

=== Domestic policies ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F073617-0004, Mainz, CDU-Bundesparteitag, Kohl.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.7|Helmut Kohl in 1986]]
Kohl's chancellorship presided over a number of innovative policy measures. Extensions in unemployment benefit for older claimants were introduced, while the benefit for the young unemployed was extended to age 21. In 1986, a child-rearing allowance was introduced to benefit parents when at least one was employed. Informal carers were offered an attendance allowance together with tax incentives, both of which were established with the tax reforms of 1990, and were also guaranteed up to 25 hours a month of professional support, which was supplemented by four weeks of annual holiday relief. In 1984, an early retirement scheme was introduced that offered incentives to employers to replace elderly workers with applicants off the unemployment register. In 1989 a partial retirement plan was introduced under which elderly employees could work half-time and receive 70% of their former salary "and be credited with 90 per cent of the full social insurance entitlement." In 1984, a Mother and Child Fund was established, providing discretionary grants "to forestall abortions on grounds of material hardship," and in 1986 a 10 Bn DM package of Erziehungsgeld (childcare allowance) was introduced, although according to various studies, this latter initiative was heavily counterbalanced by cuts. In 1989, special provisions were introduced for the older unemployed.<ref>The Federal Republic of Germany: The End of an era edited by Eva Kolinsky</ref>

Kohl's time as Chancellor also saw some controversial decisions in the field of social policy. Student aid was made reimbursable to the state<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M5wTncOaHEQC&pg=PA552 |title=Europe in the Twentieth Century |first1=Robert |last1=Paxton |first2=Julie |last2=Hessler |date=January 2011 |page=552  |isbn=978-0495913191 |access-date=3 December 2015}}</ref> while the Health Care Reform Act of 1989 introduced the concept by which patients pay up front and are reimbursed, while increasing patient co-payments for hospitalisation, spa visits, dental prostheses, and prescription drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/sites/martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/files/radich.pdf |title=A Single Health Care System for a Reunified Germany |first=Nicole A. |last=Radich |website=Martindale.cc.lehigh.edu |access-date=3 December 2015}}</ref> In addition, while a 1986 Baby-Year Pensions reform granted women born after 1921 one year of work-credit per child, lawmakers were forced by public protest to phase in supplementary pension benefits for mothers who were born before the cut-off year.<ref>{{cite book|first=Joyce Marie |last=Mushaben |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNVU3x4ZbjYC&pg=PA207 |title='Challenging the Maternalist Presumption: The Gender Politics of Welfare Reform in Germany and the United States' in Women and Welfare: Theory and Practice in the United States and Europe |editor1-first=Nancy J. |editor1-last=Hirschmann |editor2-first=Ulrike |editor2-last=Liebert |page=207 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=9780813528823 |access-date=3 December 2015}}</ref>

=== Third cabinet ===

After the [[1987 West German federal election|1987 federal elections]] Kohl won a slightly reduced majority and formed his [[Cabinet Kohl III|third cabinet]]. The SPD's candidate for chancellor was the Minister-President of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Johannes Rau]].<ref>Giuliano Bonoli, Martin Powell, ''Social Democratic Party Policies in Contemporary Europe'', p. 173, Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|9781134408917}}</ref>

In 1987, Kohl hosted East German leader [[Erich Honecker]] – the [[Erich Honecker's 1987 visit to West Germany|first ever visit]] by an East German head of state to West Germany. This is generally seen as a sign that Kohl pursued ''[[Ostpolitik]]'', a policy of [[détente]] between East and West that had been begun by the SPD-led governments (and strongly opposed by Kohl's own CDU) during the 1970s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fpri.org/article/2013/03/the-fall-of-the-berlin-wall-the-power-of-individuals-and-the-unpredictability-of-history/|title=The Fall of the Berlin Wall, the Power of Individuals, and the Unpredictability of History|publisher=Foreign Policy Research Institute|language=en-US|access-date=31 January 2017}}</ref>

=== Internal struggle for CDU leadership ===
The CDU's general secretary, Heiner Geißler, considered the party to be in a downward spiral following the relatively poor showing in the 1987 elections. Behind the scenes, he attempted to find a majority to unseat Kohl as the party's chairman and replace him with [[Lothar Späth]], the [[Minister-president]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wagner |first1=Joerg Helge |title=Putschisten und Paladine |url=https://www.weser-kurier.de/startseite_artikel,-putschisten-und-paladine-_arid,1614189.html |publisher=Weser-Kurier |access-date=28 June 2019 |language=de |date=17 June 2017}}</ref> Before the CDU party convention in [[Bremen]] started on 11 September 1989, Kohl was diagnosed with an inflammation of his prostate.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Luley |first1=Peter |title=Kohl und wie er die Welt sah |url=https://taz.de/!5154176/ |publisher=[[die tageszeitung]] |access-date=28 June 2019 |language=de |date=16 October 2009}}</ref> His doctor recommended immediate surgery, but Kohl refused to miss the convention and attended while wearing a [[catheter]] and with his doctor by his side, who he introduced as his new speech writer.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Spöcker |first1=Christoph |title=Helmut Kohl: Kleine Anekdoten aus dem Leben eines großen Politikers |date=2017 |publisher=riva Verlag |location=Munich |isbn=978-3-86883-826-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kblbCwAAQBAJ |language=de}}</ref> In the end, the "coup" was unsuccessful, as Kohl was re-elected as chairman with 79.52% of the votes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Die Wahlergebnisse aller bisherigen CDU-Vorsitzenden |url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/die-wahlergebnisse-aller-bisherigen-cdu-vorsitzenden/134980.html |newspaper=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |access-date=28 June 2019 |language=de |date=10 April 2000}}</ref> Späth, who did not stand for the position of chairman after support for Kohl became apparent, was punished by his party, failing to be elected as vice-chairman with just 357 of 731 votes.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hofmann |first1=Gunter |title=Kanzlerstark, aber kopflos |url=https://www.zeit.de/1989/38/kanzlerstark-aber-kopflos |access-date=28 June 2019 |work=[[Die Zeit]] |issue=38/1989 |language=de}}</ref> Geißler meanwhile was relieved of his duties as general secretary and replaced by [[Volker Rühe]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Parteitag: Siegen oder untergehen |url=https://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13507108.html |access-date=28 June 2019 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |issue=38/1989 |pages=26–28 |language=de}}</ref>

=== Road to reunification ===
{{Main|German reunification}}

Following the breach of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the collapse of the East German Communist regime in 1989, Kohl's handling of the East German issue would become the turning point of his chancellorship. Kohl, like most West Germans, was initially caught unawares when the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] was toppled in late 1989. Well aware of his constitutional mandate to seek German unity, he immediately moved to make it a reality. Taking advantage of the historic political changes occurring in East Germany, Kohl presented a ten-point plan for "Overcoming of the division of Germany and Europe" without consulting his coalition partner, the FDP, or the Western Allies. In February 1990, he visited the Soviet Union seeking a guarantee from [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] that the USSR would allow German reunification to proceed. One month later, the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] – the renamed SED – was roundly defeated by a grand coalition headed by the East German counterpart of Kohl's CDU, which ran on a platform of speedy reunification.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe 2008|last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |isbn=978-1-887985-95-6}}</ref>

On 18 May 1990, Kohl signed an economic and social union treaty with East Germany. This treaty stipulated that when reunification took place, it would be under the quicker provisions of Article 23 of the Basic Law.  That article stated that any new states could adhere to the Basic Law by a simple majority vote.  The alternative would have been the more protracted route of drafting a completely new constitution for the newly reunified country, as provided by Article 146 of the Basic Law.  However, the Article 146 process would have opened up contentious issues in West Germany. Even without this to consider, by this time East Germany was in a state of utter collapse.  In contrast, an Article 23 reunification could be completed in as little as six months.<ref>Alexander von Plato, ''The End of the Cold War?: Bush, Kohl, Gorbachev, and the Reunification of Germany'', p. 226, Springer, 2016, {{ISBN|9781137488725}}</ref> 

[[File:Helmut Kohl in Krzyzowa.jpg|thumb|right|Helmut Kohl in [[Krzyżowa (Świdnica County)|Krzyżowa]] (Kreisau) during his visit to Poland in 1989 that coincided with the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]]]]
Over the objections of [[Deutsche Bundesbank|Bundesbank]] president [[Karl Otto Pöhl]], he allowed a 1:1 exchange rate for wages, interest and rent between the [[German mark|West]] and [[East German mark|East Marks]]. In the end, this policy would seriously hurt companies in the [[New states of Germany|new federal states]]. Together with Foreign Minister [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], Kohl was able to resolve talks with the former Allies of World War II to allow [[German reunification]]. He received assurances from Gorbachev that a reunified Germany would be able to choose which international alliance it wanted to join, although Kohl made no secret that he wanted the reunified Germany to inherit West Germany's seats at NATO and the EC.<ref>P.

[[File:KohlModrowMomperBrandenburgerTor.jpg|thumb|left|Kohl speaks at the official opening of the [[Brandenburger Gate]] on 22 December 1989]]
A reunification treaty was signed on 31 August 1990, and was overwhelmingly approved by both parliaments on 20 September 1990. At midnight [[Central European Time]] on 3 October 1990, East Germany officially ceased to exist, and its territory joined the Federal Republic as the five states of [[Brandenburg]], Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, [[Saxony]], Saxony-Anhalt and [[Thuringia]].  These states had been the original five states of East Germany before being abolished in 1952, and had been reconstituted in August. East and West Berlin were reunited as a city-state which became the capital of the enlarged Federal Republic. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Kohl confirmed that [[Historical Eastern Germany|historically German territories]] east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] were definitively part of Poland, thereby relinquishing any claim Germany had to them. In 1993, Kohl confirmed, via treaty with the Czech Republic, that Germany would no longer bring forward territorial claims as to the pre-1945 [[ethnic German]] [[Sudetenland]]. This treaty was a disappointment for the German [[Heimatvertriebene]] ("displaced persons").<ref>Rödder 2009, S. 236 f.; Heinrich August Winkler: Der lange Weg nach Westen.

[[File:27 ClintonKohl Bachhaus.jpg|thumb|Chancellor Kohl and U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] in the [[Bach House (Eisenach)|Bach House]], 14 May 1998]]
Reunification placed Kohl in a momentarily unassailable position. In the [[1990 German federal election|1990 elections]]&nbsp;– the first free, fair and democratic all-German elections since the [[Weimar Republic]] era&nbsp;– Kohl won by a landslide over opposition candidate and Minister-President of [[Saarland]], [[Oskar Lafontaine]]. He then formed his [[Cabinet Kohl IV|fourth cabinet]].<ref>A. James McAdams, ''Germany Divided: From the Wall to Reunification'', p. 221, Princeton University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|9780691001081}}</ref>

After the [[1994 German federal election|federal elections of 1994]] Kohl was reelected with a somewhat reduced majority, defeating Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate [[Rudolf Scharping]]. The SPD was able to win a majority in the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], which significantly limited Kohl's power. In foreign politics, Kohl was more successful, for instance getting [[Frankfurt am Main]] as the seat for the [[European Central Bank]]. In 1997, Kohl received the [[Vision for Europe Award]] for his efforts in the unification of Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/ContentArchiv/EN/Archiv17/Reiseberichte/l-merkel-chosen-for-vision-for-europe-award.html|title=Bundeskanzlerin – Merkel chosen for 'Vision for Europe' Award|website=bundeskanzlerin.de}}</ref>

By the late 1990s, Kohl's popularity had dropped amid rising unemployment. He was defeated by a large margin in the [[1998 German federal election|1998 federal elections]] by the Minister-President of [[Lower Saxony]], [[Gerhard Schröder]].<ref name=Thompson />

The later Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] started her political career as Kohl's protegée and was known in the 1990s as "Kohl's girl"; in January 1991, he lifted the then little-known Merkel to national prominence by appointing her to the federal cabinet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/31/germany.lukeharding|title=The 'ordinary but ambitious' girl from the east who is set to be Germany's next leader|first=Luke|last=Harding|date=30 May 2005|via=The Guardian}}</ref>

== Retirement ==
A [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|red]]-[[Alliance '90/The Greens|green]] coalition government led by Schröder replaced Kohl's government on 27 October 1998. He immediately resigned as CDU leader and largely retired from politics. He remained a member of the Bundestag until he decided not to run for reelection in the [[2002 German federal election|2002 election]].<ref>Heribert Schwan, Rolf Steininger, ''Helmut Kohl: Virtuose der Macht'', p. 330, Artemis & Winkler, 2010</ref>

=== CDU finance affair ===
Kohl's life after political office in the beginning was dominated by the [[CDU donations scandal]]. The party financing scandal became public in 1999, when it was discovered that the CDU had received and kept illegal donations during Kohl's leadership.<ref name="Spiegel(08/07/2009)">Gerd Langguth, "[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,640938,00.html The scandal that helped Merkel become chancellor]", ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 8 July 2009</ref> ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported, "It was never suggested that Kohl benefited personally from political donations – but he did lead the party financial system outside of the legal boundaries, doing such things as opening secret bank accounts and establishing civic associations that could act as middle men, or procurement agencies, for campaign donations."<ref name="Spiegel(08/07/2009)" /> While his reputation in Germany suffered in the immediate years after the finance affair, it did not affect his reputation internationally; outside of Germany he was perceived as a great European statesman and remembered for his role in solving the five great problems of his era, the German reunification, European integration, the relations with Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union and the [[Bosnian War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article165633762/Wie-sich-das-Ausland-an-Helmut-Kohl-erinnert.html|title=Altkanzler: Wie sich das Ausland an Helmut Kohl erinnert – WELT|website=DIE WELT}}</ref>

=== Life after politics ===
{{Christian democracy sidebar}}
[[File:Vladimir Putin 6 March 2002-1.jpg|thumb|left|Kohl and [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2002]]
In 2002, Kohl left the Bundestag and officially retired from politics. Later, he was largely rehabilitated by his party. After taking office, [[Angela Merkel]] invited her former patron to the Chancellor's Office and Ronald Pofalla, the Secretary-General of the CDU, announced that the CDU would cooperate more closely with Kohl, "to take advantage of the experience of this great statesman".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/cdu_aid_102341.html|title=Kohl ist wieder stärker gefragt|website=Focus.de|access-date=6 December 2017}}</ref> On 4 March 2004, he published the first of his memoirs, called ''Memories 1930–1982'', covering the period from 1930 to 1982, when he became chancellor. The second part, published on 3 November 2005, included the first half of his chancellorship (1982–90). On 28 December 2004, he was air-lifted by the Sri Lankan Air Force, after having been stranded in a hotel by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Es war wie nach einem Bombenangriff|url=http://www.stern.de/lifestyle/leute/helmut-kohl--es-war-wie-nach-einem-bombenangriff--3547690.html|work=Stern|access-date=18 June 2015|language=de|date=30 December 2004}}</ref> Kohl was a member of the [[Club of Madrid]].<ref name="cdm">{{cite web|url=http://www.clubmadrid.org/cmadrid/index.php?id=161|title=Helmut Kohl|publisher=Club of Madrid|access-date=1 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014222641/http://www.clubmadrid.org/cmadrid/index.php?id=161|archive-date=14 October 2007}}</ref>

As reported in the German press, he also gave his name to the ''Helmut Kohl Centre for European Studies'' (currently ''Centre for European Studies''), which is the new political foundation of the [[European People's Party]]. In late February 2008, Kohl suffered a stroke in combination with a fall which caused serious head injuries and required his hospitalisation, after which he was reported as bound to a wheelchair due to partial paralysis and with difficulty speaking.<ref>[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008/05/14/story_14-5-2008_pg4_5 "Ailing former German chancellor Helmut Kohl marries"], ''Daily Times'', 14 May 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/former-german-chancellor-in-hospital-concerns-grow-over-helmut-kohl-s-health-a-548676.html ''Former German Chancellor in Hospital: Concerns Grow Over Helmut Kohl's Health''], ''Der Spiegel'', 21 May 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.thelocal.de/politics/20090509-19173.html "Weakened Helmut Kohl appears in public after operation"], ''The Local'', 9 May 2009</ref><ref>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hrh6dqJ6W74wIlziZdewYHzu35_w ''Kohl, Bush, Gorbachev remember Cold War in Berlin''], AFP, 31 October 2009.</ref> He remained in intensive care since, marrying his 43-year-old partner, Maike Richter, on 8 May 2008, while still in hospital.

In 2011, Kohl, despite frail health, began giving a number of interviews and issued statements in which he sharply condemned his successor Angela Merkel, whom he had formerly mentored, on her policies in favour of strict [[austerity]] in the [[European debt crisis]] and later also towards Russia in the [[Ukrainian crisis]],<ref name="BI">Alessi, Christopher; Raymunt, Monica (214).

By April 2017, a German court ordered publisher Random House and the two journalists to pay Kohl damages of 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for violating his privacy, making it the highest judgment ever rendered for violations of privacy rights under German law.<ref>Andrea Shalal (27 April 2017), [https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-kohl-idUSL8N1HZ8NN Germany's Kohl wins record damages for unauthorised quotes] [[Reuters]].</ref>

== Political views ==
Kohl was committed to [[European integration]], maintaining close relations with the French President [[François Mitterrand]]. Parallel to this, he was committed to [[German reunification]]. Although he continued the [[Ostpolitik]] of his social-democratic predecessors, Kohl supported Reagan's more aggressive policies in order to weaken the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Sean N. Kalic, "Reagan's SDI announcement and the European reaction.

== Personality and media portrayals ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F045625-0010, Bonn, Pressekonferenz CDU Bundesvorstand, Kohl.jpg|thumb|right|Kohl in 1975. In his years as minister-president, Kohl was treated by the media as a progressive reformer in his own party. This image changed during the 70s with Kohl's assumption of leadership in the federal party. He experienced a fundamental animosity of journalists towards him.]]
Kohl faced stiff opposition from the West German political left and was mocked for his physical stature, alleged provinciality, simplistic language, and local dialect. Similar to historical French cartoons of [[Louis-Philippe of France]], Hans Traxler depicted Kohl as a [[pear]] in the left-leaning satirical journal ''[[Titanic (magazine)|Titanic]]''.<ref>[http://www.taz.de/!34964/ Hans Traxler wird 80, Der Erfinder der "Birne"], ''die Tageszeitung'', 20 May 2009</ref> The German word "Birne" ("pear") became a widespread nickname for and symbol of the chancellor.<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/883/312794/text Birne auf Breitwand, Dreharbeiten zu "Helmut Kohl – Der Film"], ''Sueddeutsche Zeitung'' 5 October 2008</ref>

Comedians like Thomas Freitag and Stefan Wald imitated the chancellor,<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13511297.html Se quätschn], in: Der Spiegel, November 12th, 1984, last retrieved June 18th, 2017.</ref> and books were sold with jokes rewritten with Kohl as the stupid protagonist. When Kohl died, left wing newspaper TAZ presented a title page showing a flower set typical for funerals, with a pear and the caption ''flourishing landscapes'', Kohl's euphemism for East Germany after reunification. Following protests the editor-in-chief apologised.<ref>[http://www.focus.de/politik/videos/das-ging-daneben-taz-chef-tut-titelseite-zu-kohls-tod-leid_id_7254227.html "taz"-Chef tut Titelseite zu Kohls Tod leid], in: FOCUS ONLINE, June 17th, 2017, last retrieved June 18th, 2017.</ref>

The minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate (1969–1976) was a young reformer in a somewhat backward state, and a newcomer who heavily criticised the older party leaders. The national media, for as much as they took notice of him, regarded him with curiosity. But this changed when Kohl became chair of the federal party in 1973, and even more dramatically when in late 1975 his party made him candidate for the chancellery. His opponents within the federal party, but also journalists and other observers, had their doubts whether the parochial but successful moderniser of a manageable smaller state was the right person to lead the Federal Republic, a huge and complicated industrial country.<ref>Hans Peter Schwarz: ''Helmut Kohl. Eine politische Biographie.'' DVA, Munich 2012, p. 215.</ref>

Biographer Hans Peter Schwarz names five problems of the 46 year old candidate: being unfamiliar with the complicated relations in the Bundestag faction, having no international experience, having no profound knowledge of economics, but also: a lack of charisma and no cultural acceptance in Northern Germany.<ref>Hans Peter Schwarz: ''Helmut Kohl. Eine politische Biographie.'' DVA, Munich 2012, p. 209.</ref>

In small circles Kohl was fascinating and a perfect host; the larger the crowd, the vaguer, weaker and paler he appeared. His gaze into TV cameras made him look helpless. When attacked, e.g. in election campaigns, he became a good fighter. But in general he was no great orator, his speeches were lengthy and verbose. Additionally, the Catholic with his Palatinate dialect, a folksy man who had culture but was simply no intellectual – to North German journalists (like from the important newspapers made in Hamburg) he just felt foreign, more than any previous CDU chairman.<ref>Hans Peter Schwarz: ''Helmut Kohl. Eine politische Biographie.'' DVA, Munich 2012, p. 217.</ref>

Kohl was a true people's person and loved to be in company of groups. His tremendous memory about people and their lives helped him to build up his networks in the Christian Democratic Union, in government and abroad. In a study of German chancellorship as political leadership, Henrik Gast gives examples how much time Kohl invested into personal relationships even with the backbenchers in the Bundestag and also party officials up to the local level. This worked, because it fitted Kohl's character and was authentic.<ref>Henrik Gast: ''Der Bundeskanzler als politischer Führer. Potenziale und Probleme deutscher Regierungschefs aus interdisziplinärer Perspektive.'' VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften / Springer Fachmedien, Wiesbaden 2011, p. 208/209, S. 242.</ref>

Kohl knew that all these people were the basis of his political power and that he needed their loyalty and personal affection. He could also be rude to subordinates and assistants, and confront political adversaries. "He was capable of both – being empathetic and being extremely confrontational! If you did not do what he wanted, empathy was over!", as Gast quotes a federal minister of Kohl's own party. There was also a difference between the younger Kohl and the chancellor in his later years, a parliamentary state secretary recalled: "A sense of tact and politeness? The early and the later Kohl – that was a tremendous difference. In the early years he had all of that, in the later years no more."<ref>Henrik Gast: ''Der Bundeskanzler als politischer Führer. Potenziale und Probleme deutscher Regierungschefs aus interdisziplinärer Perspektive.'' VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften / Springer Fachmedien, Wiesbaden 2011, p. 264..</ref>

==Personal life==

===Family of Helmut Kohl===

[[File:Hannelore kohl.jpg|thumb|Kohl's wife [[Hannelore Kohl]], to whom he was married from 1960 until her death in 2001]]
[[File:Friedhof-Ludwigshafen-Friesenheim-11.JPG|thumb|The Kohl family tomb in [[Ludwigshafen]] where [[Hannelore Kohl]] and both of Helmut Kohl's parents are interred]]

On 27 June 1960, Kohl married [[Hannelore Kohl|Hannelore Renner]], after he had already asked for her hand in marriage in 1953, delaying the ceremony until he was financially stable.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=88}} Both had known each other since 1948, when they met in a dancing class.{{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=83}} They had two sons, [[Walter Kohl]] (born 1963) and [[Peter Kohl]] (born 1965). Hannelore Kohl had studied languages and spoke fluent French and English; during her husband's political career, she was an important adviser to him, especially on world affairs. She was a steadfast advocate of [[German reunification]] even before it seemed feasible, and of [[NATO]] and Germany's alliance with the United States.

Both sons were educated in the United States, at Harvard University and MIT, respectively. Walter Kohl worked as a financial analyst with [[Morgan Stanley]] in New York City and later founded a consulting firm with his father in 1999. Peter Kohl worked as an investment banker in London for many years. Walter Kohl was formerly married to the business administration academic [[Christine Volkmann]] and they have a son, Johannes Volkmann; he is now married to the Korean-born Kyung-Sook Kohl née Hwang. Peter Kohl is married to the Turkish-born investment banker [[Elif Sözen-Kohl]], the daughter of a wealthy Turkish industrialist, and they have a daughter, Leyla Kohl (born 2002).<ref>"[http://www.rp-online.de/panorama/huerriyet-helmut-kohl-ist-grossvater-aid-1.2047064 Enkeltochter heißt Leyla – 'Hürriyet': Helmut Kohl ist Großvater]," ''[[Rheinische Post]]'', 12 March 2002</ref>

On 5 July 2001, his wife, [[Hannelore Kohl|Hannelore]], committed suicide; she had suffered from [[photodermatitis]] for many years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jul/15/theobserver.focus|title=The secret pain that only death could silence|date=15 July 2001|via=The Guardian}}</ref>
