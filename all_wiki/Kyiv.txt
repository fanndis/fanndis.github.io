Kyiv is an important industrial, scientific, educational and cultural center of Eastern Europe. It is home to many [[High tech|high-tech]] industries, higher education institutions, and historical landmarks. The city has an extensive system of public transport and infrastructure, including the [[Kyiv Metro]].

The city's name is said to derive from the name of [[Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv|Kyi]], one of its four legendary founders. During [[History of Kyiv|its history]], Kyiv, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of prominence and obscurity. The city probably existed as a commercial center as early as the 5th century. A [[Slavs|Slavic]] settlement on the great trade route between [[Scandinavia]] and [[Constantinople]], Kyiv was a tributary of the [[Khazars]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/kiev|title=Kiev|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref> until its capture by the [[Varangians]] ([[Vikings]]) in the mid-9th century. Under Varangian rule, the city became a capital of the [[Kievan Rus']], the first [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] state. Completely destroyed during the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasions]] in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. It was a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbours, first [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], then [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kyiv|title=Kyiv - History|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>

The city prospered again during the [[Russian Empire]]'s [[Industrial Revolution]] in the late 19th century. In 1918, after the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] declared independence from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], Kyiv became its capital. From 1921 onwards Kyiv was a city of [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]], which was proclaimed by the [[Red Army]], and, from 1934, Kyiv was its capital. The city was almost completely ruined during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]] but quickly recovered in the postwar years, remaining the [[Soviet Union]]'s third-largest city.

Following [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–1991)|the collapse of the Soviet Union]] and [[History of Ukraine|Ukrainian independence]] in 1991, Kyiv remained Ukraine's capital and experienced a steady influx of ethnic Ukrainian migrants from other regions of the country.<ref name="History of Ukraine">{{cite book|last=Magocsi|first=Paul Robert|title=A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0mKRsElYNkC&pg=PT481|edition=2nd, Revised|year=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-4426-9879-6|page=481}}</ref> During the country's transformation to a [[market economy]] and [[Representative democracy|electoral democracy]], Kyiv has continued to be Ukraine's largest and wealthiest city. Its armament-dependent industrial output fell after the Soviet collapse, adversely affecting science and technology, but new sectors of the economy such as services and [[finance]] facilitated Kyiv's growth in salaries and investment, as well as providing continuous funding for the development of [[housing]] and urban infrastructure. Kyiv emerged as the most pro-Western region of Ukraine; [[political parties in Ukraine|parties]] advocating tighter [[Ukraine–European Union relations|integration with the European Union]] dominate during [[Elections in Ukraine|elections]].<ref name="radiosvoboda.org">{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/24756059.html Виборчі комісії фіксують перемогу опозиційних кандидатів у Києві]</ref><ref name="Битва за Київ">{{cite news | url=http://kontrakty.ua/article/59790 | script-title=uk:Битва за Київ: чому посада мера вже не потрібна Кличку і чи будуть вибори взагалі | date=19 March 2013 | agency=Kontrakty | accessdate=19 August 2013|language=uk}}</ref><ref name="Nebozhenko">{{cite web | url=http://gazeta.ua/articles/politics/_u-kozhnogo-kiyanina-v-golovi-dosvid-majdanu-i-ce-golovnij-bil-vsih-predstavnikiv/493982 | script-title=uk:У кожного киянина в голові – досвід Майдану | date=20 April 2013 | accessdate=19 August 2013|language=uk}}</ref><ref name="pravda1629">{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2012/10/29/6975859/ Interactive parliamentary election 2012 result maps] by [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]<br/>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.cvk.gov.ua/ Election results in Ukraine since 1998], [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine]]<br/>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2UoQ-ueHjdEC&pg=PA1629 Nations and Nationalism: A Global Historical Overview], [[ABC-CLIO]], 2008, {{ISBN|1851099077}} (page 1629)<br/>[https://books.google.com/books?id=cQqr7f9QkngC&pg=PA122 Ukraine on its Meandering Path Between East and West] by [[Andrej Lushnycky]] and [[Mykola Riabchuk]], [[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang]], 2009, {{ISBN|303911607X}}  (page 122)<br/>[http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/eastweek/2012-11-07/after-parliamentary-elections-ukraine-a-tough-victory-party-regions After the parliamentary elections in Ukraine: a tough victory for the Party of Regions], [[Centre for Eastern Studies]] (7 November 2012)<br/>[https://books.google.com/books?id=H23Pv4Ik3vMC&pg=PA396 Communist and Post-Communist Parties in Europe] by [[Uwe Backes]] and [[Patrick Moreau]], [[Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht]], 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-525-36912-8}} (page 396)<br/>[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/126937.html#.UUzMyKnCus0 Party of Regions gets 185 seats in Ukrainian parliament, Batkivschyna 101 – CEC], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (12 November 2012)<br/>[https://archive.is/20130420221924/http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/udar-submits-to-rada-resolution-on-ukraines-integration-with-eu/ UDAR submits to Rada resolution on Ukraine’s integration with EU], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (8 January 2013)<br/>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.ucipr.kiev.ua/publications/electronic-bulletin-your-choice-2012-issue-4-batkivshchyna/lang/en Electronic Bulletin "Your Choice – 2012".

The Ukrainian name is {{lang-uk|Ки́їв|label=none|}}, written in the Ukrainian [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabet]], and usually rendered in Latin letters (or [[Romanization|romanized]]) as {{Transl|uk|Kyiv}}. Ukrainian is an [[Fusional language|inflected language]], and the [[Genitive case|genitive form]] is {{Lang-uk|Ки́єва|translit=Kyieva|label=none}}, meaning "of Kyiv". 

Before standardization of the alphabet in the early twentieth century, the name was also spelled {{Lang|uk|Кыѣвъ}}, {{Lang|uk|Киѣвъ}}, or {{Lang|uk|Кіѣвъ}} with the now-obsolete letter [[yat]]. The Old Ukrainian spelling from the 14th and 15th centuries was nominally *Києвъ, but various attested spellings include кїєва ([[Genitive case|gen.]]), Кїєвь and Киев ([[Accusative case|acc.]]), кїєво or кїєвом ([[Instrumental case|ins.]]), києвє, Кіеве, Кїєвѣ, Києвѣ, or Киѣве ([[Locative case|loc.]]).<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Slovnyk staroukraïnsʹkoï movy XIV–XV st&#46;|publisher=Naukova Dumka|year=1977|isbn=|editor-last=Humetsʹka|editor-first=L.

The name descends from [[Old East Slavic]] {{Transl|orv|Kyjevŭ}} ({{Lang-orv|Kыѥвъ|label=none}}). Old East Slavic chronicles, such as [[Laurentian Codex]] and [[Novgorod Chronicle]], used the spellings Києвъ, Къıєвъ, or Кїєвъ.<ref>[http://litopys.org.ua/lavrlet/lavr25.htm Lavretian Chronicle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118004304/http://litopys.org.ua/lavrlet/lavr25.htm|date=2008-01-18}} and [http://litopys.org.ua/novglet/novg23.htm Novgorod Chronicles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802215430/http://litopys.org.ua/novglet/novg24.htm|date=2020-08-02}}: [http://litopys.org.ua/novglet/novg24.htm "''В лЂто 6743.

As a prominent city with a long history, its English name was subject to gradual evolution. Early English sources spelled this word as ''Kiou'', ''Kiow'', ''Kiew'', ''Kiovia''. On one of the oldest English maps of the region, {{lang|la|Russiae, Moscoviae et Tartariae|italic=yes}} published by [[Abraham Ortelius|Ortelius]] (London, 1570) the name of the city is spelled ''Kiou''. On the 1650 map by [[Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan|Guillaume de Beauplan]], the name of the city is ''Kiiow'', and the region was named ''Kÿowia''. In the book ''Travels'', by Joseph Marshall (London, 1772), the city is called ''Kiovia''.<ref name=Marshall>{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=Joseph, fl.1770 |title=Travels through Germany, Russia, and Poland in the years 1769 and 1770. |origyear=1772 |year=1971 |publisher=Arno Press |location=New York |isbn=0-405-02763-X |lccn=77135821}} Originally published: London, J.

There is little historical evidence pertaining to the period when the city was founded. Scattered [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlements existed in the area from the 6th century, but it is unclear whether any of them later developed into the city. On the [[Ptolemy's map]] there are shown several settlements along the mid-stream of [[Borysthenes]] among of which is Azagarium. Some historians believe that it could be the old Kyiv.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/%D0%A0%D0%B8%D0%BC%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%9A%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%B2.html?id=YWg2ywEACAAJ Roman Kiev: or Castrum Azagarium at Kievan Podil (Римский Киев: или Castrum Azagarium на Киево-Подоле]</ref> However, according to the 1773 "Dictionary of Ancient Geography" of [[Alexander Macbean]], the settlement corresponds to modern city of [[Chernobyl]].

Another name related Kyiv mentioned in history, origin of which is not completely clear, is Sambat and has something to do with the [[Khazar Empire]]. As previously stated the ''Primary Chronicle'' mentions that residents of Kyiv told [[Askold and Dir|Askold]] that "there were three brothers Kyi, Shchek and Khoriv. They founded this town and died, and now we are staying and paying taxes to their relatives the Khazars". In his book [[De Administrando Imperio]] [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]], mentioning the caravan of small-cargo boats assembled annually before the capital city on the [[Dnieper]], writes, "They come down the river Dnieper and assemble at the strong-point of Kyiv (Kioava), also called Sambatas".<ref>Sigfús Blöndal. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=vFRug14ui7gC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=de+administrando+imperio+Kioava&source=bl&ots=Wnsq6ePXjd&sig=ACfU3U0q7AqEvpTy7StBDeqXxKsRj5Ee3A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj0ooe3rYjqAhVwQjABHfbIBRsQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=de%20administrando%20imperio%20Kioava&f=false The Varangians of Byzantium]".</ref> In addition to that at least three Arabic speaking 10th century geographers who traveled the area mention the city of Zānbat as the chief city of the Russes, among which are [[Ahmad ibn Rustah]], [[Abu Sa'id Gardezi]], and an author of the [[Hudud al-'Alam]]. The texts of those authors were discovered by Russian orientalist [[Alexander Tumansky]]. The etymology of Sambat has been argued by many historians including [[:ru:Ильинский, Григорий Андреевич|Grigoriy Ilyinsky]], [[Nikolay Karamzin]], [[Jan Potocki]], [[:ru:Ламбин, Николай Петрович|Nikolay Lambin]], [[Joachim Lelewel]], [[Guðbrandur Vigfússon]] and many others. The historian [[Julius Brutzkus]] in his work "The Khazar Origin of Ancient Kiev" hypothesizes that both Sambat and Kyiv are of Khazar origin meaning "hill fortress" and "lower settlement" respectively. Brutzkus claims that Sambat is not Kyiv, but rather [[Vyshhorod]] (High City) which is located nearby.

The Primary Chronicles state that at some point during the late 9th or early 10th century in Kyiv ruled [[Askold and Dir]] who may have been of Viking or Varangian descent and later were murdered by [[Oleg of Novgorod]]. The ''Primary Chronicle'' dates the Oleg's conquest of the town in 882, but some historians, such as [[Omeljan Pritsak]] and [[Constantine Zuckerman]], dispute that arguing that Khazar rule continued as late as the 920s (among notable historical documents are the [[Kyivan letter]] and [[Schechter Letter]]). Other historians suggest that Magyar tribes ruled the city between 840 and 878, before migrating with some [[Khazars|Khazar]] tribes to the [[Carpathian Basin]]. The Primary Chronicles also mention movement of Hungarians pass Kyiv. To this day in Kyiv exists a place known as "[[:ru:Угорское урочище|Uhorske urochyshche]]" (Hungarian place),<ref>[https://pechersk.kyivcity.gov.ua/content/mennyu-1.html History]. Pechersk Raion in the Kiev City.</ref> which is better known as [[Askold's Grave]]. According to the aforementioned scholars the building of the fortress of Kyiv was finished in 840 under the leadership of Keő (Keve), Csák and Geréb, the three brothers, possibly members of the [[Tarján tribe]]. The three names appear in the Kyiv Chronicle [[Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv]] may be not of Slavic origin as Russian historians have always struggled to account for their meanings and origins. According to Hungarian historian Viktor Padányi, their names were put into the Kyiv Chronicle in the 12th century, and they were identified as old-Russian mythological heroes.<ref>dr. Viktor Padányi – Dentu-Magyaria p. 325, footnote 15</ref>

In the early 1320s a Lithuanian army led by Grand Duke [[Gediminas]] defeated a Slavic army led by [[Stanislav of Kyiv]] at the [[Battle on the Irpen' River]] and conquered the city. The [[Tatars]], who also claimed Kyiv, retaliated in 1324–1325, so while Kyiv was ruled by a Lithuanian prince, it had to pay tribute to the [[Golden Horde]]. Finally, as a result of the [[Battle of Blue Waters]] in 1362, [[Algirdas]], Grand Duke of Lithuania, incorporated Kyiv and surrounding areas into the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref>Jones, Michael (2000).

In 1834 the Russian government established Saint Vladimir University, now called the [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]] after the Ukrainian poet [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814–1861). (Shevchenko worked as a field researcher and editor for the geography department). The medical faculty of the Saint Vladimir University, separated into an independent institution in 1919–1921 during the Soviet period, became the [[Bogomolets National Medical University]] in 1995.

During the 18th and 19th centuries the [[Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Russian military]] and ecclesiastical authorities dominated city life;{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] had involvement in a significant part of Kyiv's infrastructure and commercial activity. In the late 1840s the historian, [[Nikolay Kostomarov|Mykola Kostomarov]] ''({{lang-ru|link=no|Nikolay Kostomarov}})'', founded a secret political society, the Brotherhood of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril]] and [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]], whose members put forward the idea of a federation of free Slavic peoples with Ukrainians as a distinct and separate group rather than a subordinate part of the Russian nation; the Russian authorities quickly suppressed the society.

Following the gradual loss of Ukraine's autonomy, Kyiv experienced growing Russification in the 19th century by means of Russian migration, administrative actions and social modernization. At the beginning of the 20th century the [[Russian language|Russian]]-speaking part of the population dominated the city centre, while the [[Social class|lower classes]] living on the outskirts retained Ukrainian [[folk culture]] to a significant extent.{{Citation needed|date= April 2011}} However, enthusiasts among ethnic Ukrainian nobles, military and merchants made recurrent attempts to preserve native culture in Kyiv (by clandestine book-printing, amateur theatre, folk studies etc.)

[[File:Kiev downtown.jpg|thumb|right|Kyiv in the late 19th century]]
During the [[Russian industrial revolution]] in the late 19th century, Kyiv became an important trade and transportation centre of the [[Russian Empire]], specialising in sugar and grain export by railway and on the Dnieper river. By 1900 the city had also become a significant industrial centre, having a population of 250,000. Landmarks of that period include the railway infrastructure, the foundation of numerous educational and cultural facilities as well as notable architectural monuments (mostly merchant-oriented). In 1892 the [[Trams in Kyiv|first electric tram line]] of the Russian Empire started running in Kyiv (the 3rd in the world).

Kyiv prospered during the late 19th century [[Industrial Revolution]] in the [[Russian Empire]], when it became the third most important city of the Empire and the major centre of commerce of its southwest. In the [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|turbulent period]] following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|1917 Russian Revolution]], Kyiv became the capital of several [[Ukrainian People's Republic|successive Ukrainian states]] and was caught in the middle of several conflicts: [[World War I]], during which German soldiers occupied it from 2 March 1918 to November 1918, the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917 to 1922, and the [[Polish–Soviet War]] of 1919–1921. During the last three months of 1919, Kyiv was intermittently controlled by the [[White Army]]. Kyiv changed hands sixteen times from the end of 1918 to August 1920.<ref>{{cite book |title= Walking Since Daybreak|url= https://archive.org/details/walkingsincedayb0000ekst|url-access= registration|last= Eksteins|first= Modris|year= 1999|publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton Mifflin]]|isbn= 0-618-08231-X|page= [https://archive.org/details/walkingsincedayb0000ekst/page/87 87]}}</ref>

From 1921 to 1991 the city formed part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], which became a founding republic of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922. The major events that took place in Soviet Ukraine during the [[interwar period]] all affected Kyiv: the 1920s [[Ukrainization]] as well as the migration of the rural [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainophone]] population made the [[Russophone]] city Ukrainian-speaking and bolstered the development of [[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian cultural life]] in the city; the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)|Soviet Industrialization]] that started in the late 1920s turned the city, a former centre of commerce and religion, into a major industrial, technological and scientific centre; the [[Holodomor|1932–1933 Great Famine]] devastated the part of the migrant population not registered for ration cards; and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] of 1937–1938 almost eliminated the city's [[intelligentsia]]<ref name="Brama">{{cite web |url= http://www.brama.com/ukraine/history/terror/index.html |title= The Great Purge under Stalin 1937–38 |publisher= brama.com |accessdate= 14 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="Figes">[[Orlando Figes]] ''The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia'', 2007, {{ISBN|0805074619}}, pages 227–315.</ref><ref name="Social Catastrophe">Robert Gellately, ''Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe'' (Knopf, 2007: {{ISBN|1-4000-4005-1}}), 720 pages.</ref>

In 1934 Kyiv became the capital of Soviet Ukraine. The city boomed again during the years of Soviet industrialization as its population grew rapidly and many industrial giants were established, some of which exist today.

[[File:Ruined Kiev in WWII.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of Kyiv during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War&nbsp;II]]]]
In [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], the city again suffered significant damage, and [[Nazi Germany]] occupied it from 19 September 1941 to [[Battle of Kiev (1943)|6 November 1943]]. Axis forces killed or captured more than 600,000 Soviet soldiers in the great encirclement [[Battle of Kyiv (1941)|Battle of Kyiv]] in 1941. Most of those captured never returned alive.<ref>Daniel Goldhagen, ''Hitler's Willing Executioners'' (p. 290) – "2.8&nbsp;million young, healthy Soviet POWs" killed by the Germans, "mainly by starvation... in less than eight months" of 1941–42, before "the decimation of Soviet POWs... was stopped" and the Germans "began to use them as laborers".</ref> Shortly after the [[Wehrmacht]] occupied the city, a team of [[NKVD]] officers who had remained hidden dynamited most of the buildings on the [[Khreshchatyk]], the main street of the city, where German military and civil authorities had occupied most of the buildings; the buildings burned for days and 25,000 people were left homeless.

Allegedly in response to the actions of the NKVD, the Germans rounded up all the local [[The Holocaust in Ukraine|Jews]] they could find, nearly 34,000,<ref>{{Cite web|title= Babi Yar |website= Jewish Virtual Library |date= 2012 |url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/babiyar.html}}</ref> and massacred them at [[Babi Yar]] in Kyiv on 29 and 30 September 1941.<ref>Andy Dougan, ''Dynamo: Triumph and Tragedy in Nazi-Occupied Kiev'' (Globe Pequot, 2004: {{ISBN|1-59228-467-1}}), p. 83.</ref> In the months that followed, thousands more were taken to Babi Yar where they were shot.

Kyiv recovered economically in the post-war years, becoming once again the third-most important city of the Soviet Union. The [[Chernobyl disaster|catastrophic accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] in 1986 occurred only {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the city. However, the prevailing south wind blew most of the radioactive debris away from Kyiv.

In the course of the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–1991)|collapse of the Soviet Union]] the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian parliament]] proclaimed the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]] in the city on 24 August 1991. In 2004–2005, the city played host to the largest post-Soviet public demonstrations up to that time, in support of the [[Orange Revolution]]. From November 2013 until February 2014, central Kyiv became the primary location of [[Euromaidan]].

===Geography===
[[File:Kiev L7 20010914.jpg|thumb|left|[[Landsat 7]] image of Kyiv and the [[Dnieper]]]]
Geographically, Kyiv is located on the border of the [[Polesia]] woodland ecological zone, a part of the European mixed woods area, and the East European [[forest steppe]] [[biome]]. However, the city's unique landscape distinguishes it from the surrounding region. Kyiv is completely surrounded by [[Kyiv Oblast]].

Originally on the west bank, today Kyiv is located on both sides of the [[Dnieper]], which flows southwards through the city towards the [[Black Sea]]. The older and higher western part of the city sits on numerous wooded hills ([[Kyiv Mountains|Kyiv Hills]]), with ravines and small rivers. Kyiv's geographical relief contributed to its [[toponym]]s, such as Podil (means lower), Pechersk (caves), and uzviz (a steep street, "descent"). Kyiv is a part of the larger [[Dnieper Upland]] adjoining the western bank of the Dnieper in its mid-flow, and which contributes to the city's elevation change. The northern outskirts of the city border the [[Polesian Lowland]]. Kyiv expanded into the [[Dnieper Lowland]] on the left bank (''to the east'') as late as the 20th century. The whole portion of Kyiv on the left bank of the Dnieper is generally referred to as ''Left bank'' ({{lang-uk|Лівий берег}}, Livyi bereh). Significant areas of the left bank Dnieper valley were artificially sand-deposited, and are protected by dams.

Within the city the Dnieper River forms a branching system of [[tributary|tributaries]], isles, and harbors within the city limits. The city is close to the mouth of the [[Desna River]] and the [[Kyiv Reservoir]] in the north, and the [[Kaniv Reservoir]] in the south. Both the Dnieper and Desna rivers are [[navigation|navigable]] at Kyiv, although regulated by the reservoir shipping locks and limited by winter freeze-over.

In total, there are 448 bodies of open water within the boundaries of Kyiv, which include the Dnieper itself, its reservoirs, and several small rivers, dozens of lakes and artificially created ponds. They occupy 7949 hectares. Additionally, the city has 16 developed beaches (totalling 140 hectares) and 35 near-water recreational areas (covering more than 1,000 hectares). Many are used for pleasure and recreation, although some of the bodies of water are not suitable for swimming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kyivcity.gov.ua/news/u_kiyevi_bilya_vodoym_vidkrito_32_zoni_dlya_vidpochinku_z_yakikh_12__iz_mozhlivistyu_kupannya/ |website=kyivcity.gov.ua |title=У Києві біля водойм відкрито 32 зони для відпочинку, з яких 12 – із можливістю купання |publisher=Kyivcity.gov.ua|language=uk|date=19 June 2020 |accessdate=12 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2020/06/19/7256376/ |website=pravda.com.ua |title=У Кличка розповіли, де в Києві можна купатися, а де тільки засмагати.

==Legal status, local government and politics==

=== Legal status and local government ===
{{Main|Legal status and local government of Kyiv}}

The municipality of the city of Kyiv has a [[Cities with special status|special legal status]] within Ukraine compared to the other [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|administrative subdivisions of the country]]. The most significant difference is that the city is considered as a region of Ukraine (see [[Regions of Ukraine]]). It is the only city that has double jurisdiction. The Head of [[Chief of Local State Administration (Ukraine)|City State Administration]] — the city's governor, is appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]], while the Head of the City Council – the [[Mayor of Kyiv]], is elected by local popular vote.

The Mayor of Kyiv is [[Vitali Klitschko]] who was sworn in on 5 June 2014;<ref name=KKMs5614>[https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/208052.html Vitali Klitschko sworn in as mayor of Kyiv], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (5 June 2014)</ref> after he had won the [[2014 Kyiv local election|25 May 2014 Kyiv mayoral elections]] with almost 57% of the votes.<ref name="votecountKMEIU4614">[https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/207829.html Klitschko officially announced as winner of Kyiv mayor election], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (4 June 2014)</ref> Since 25 June 2014 Klitschko is also [[Kyiv City State Administration|Head of Kyiv City Administration]].<ref name="Poroshenko appoints Klitschko head of Kyiv city administration - decree">[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/210904.html Poroshenko appoints Klitschko head of Kyiv city administration – decree], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (25 June 2014)<br />[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/210980.html Poroshenko orders Klitschko to bring title of best European capital back to Kyiv], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (25 June 2014)</ref> Klitschko was last reelected in the [[2020 Kyiv local election]] with 50.52% of the votes, in the first round of the election.<ref name="3131537KlitschkoRE">[https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-elections/3131537-vitali-klitschko-wins-in-first-round-of-kyiv-mayor-election.html Vitali Klitschko wins in first round of Kyiv mayor election], [[Ukrinform]] (6 November 2020)</ref>

Most key buildings of the national government are located along [[Hrushevskoho Street]] (vulytsia Mykhaila Hrushevskoho) and Institute Street (vulytsia Instytutska). Hrushevskoho Street is named after the Ukrainian academician, politician, historian, and statesman [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]], who wrote an academic book titled: "Bar Starostvo: Historical Notes: XV-XVIII" about the history of [[Bar, Ukraine]].<ref>Hrushevsky, M., Bar Starostvo: Historical Notes: XV-XVIII, St. Vladimir University Publishing House, Bol'shaya-Vasil'kovskaya, Building no. 29-31, Kiev, Ukraine, 1894; Lviv, Ukraine, {{ISBN|5-12-004335-6}}, pp. 1 – 623, 1996.</ref> That portion of the city is also unofficially known as the government quarter ({{lang-uk|урядовий квартал}}).

The city state administration and council is located in the Kyiv City council building on [[Khreshchatyk]] Street. The oblast state administration and council is located in the [[Kyiv Oblast]] council building on ploshcha Lesi Ukrayinky (Lesya Ukrayinka Square). The [[Kyiv-Sviatoshyn Raion]] state administration is located near Kiltseva doroha (Ring Road) on prospekt Peremohy (Victory Parkway), while the Kyiv-Svyatoshyn Raion local council is located on vulytsia Yantarna (Yantarnaya Street).

The [[Dnieper River]] naturally divides Kyiv into the Right Bank and the Left Bank areas. Historically located on the western right bank of the river, the city expanded into the left bank only in the 20th century. Most of Kyiv's attractions as well as the majority of business and governmental institutions are located on the right bank. The eastern 'Left Bank' is predominantly residential. There are large industrial and green areas in both the Right Bank and the Left Bank.

Kyiv is further informally divided into historical or territorial neighbourhoods, each housing from about 5,000 to 100,000 inhabitants.

The first known formal subdivision of Kyiv dates to 1810 when the city was subdivided into 4 parts: [[Pechersk, Kyiv|Pechersk]], Starokyiv, and the first and the second parts of [[Podil]]. In 1833–1834 according to [[Russian tsar|Tsar]] [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]'s decree, Kyiv was subdivided into 6 police [[raion]]s (districts); later being increased to 10. In 1917, there were 8 Raion Councils (''Duma''), which were reorganised by [[bolshevik]]s into 6 Party-Territory Raions.

During the Soviet era, as the city was expanding, the number of raions also gradually increased. These newer districts of the city, along with some older areas were then named in honour of prominent communists and socialist-revolutionary figures; however, due to the way in which many communist party members eventually, after a certain period of time, fell out of favour and so were replaced with new, fresher minds, so too did the names of Kyiv's districts change accordingly.

The last raion reform took place in 2001 when the number of raions has been decreased from 14 to 10.

Under [[Oleksandr Omelchenko]] ([[Mayor of Kyiv|mayor]] from 1999 to 2006), there were further plans for the merger of some raions and revision of their boundaries, and the total number of raions had been planned to be decreased from 10 to 7. With the election of the new mayor-elect ([[Leonid Chernovetskyi|Leonid Chernovetsky]]) in 2006, these plans were shelved.

Each raion has its own [[local government|locally elected government]] with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs.

According to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|All-Ukrainian Census]], the population of Kyiv in 2001 was 2,611,300.<ref name=population/> The historic changes in population are shown in the side table. According to the census, some 1,393,000 (53.3%) were female and 1,219,000 (46.7%) were male. Comparing the results with the previous census (1989) shows the trend of [[population ageing]] which, while prevalent throughout the country, is partly offset in Kyiv by the inflow of working age migrants. Some 1,069,700 people had higher or completed secondary education, a significant increase of 21.7% since 1989.

The June 2007 unofficial population estimate based on amount of [[bakery]] products sold in the city (thus including temporary visitors and commuters) gave a number of at least 3.5&nbsp;million people.<ref name="undercounted residents in Kiev">{{cite news | url=http://www.korrespondent.net/main/194785 | title=There are up to 1.5 mln undercounted residents in Kiev | work=[[Korrespondent]] | date=15 June 2007 | accessdate=2 September 2013 | language=ru}}</ref>

Modern Kyiv is a mix of the old (Kyiv preserved about 70 percent of more than 1,000 buildings built during 1907–1914<ref name="Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv">[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/109648/ Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204003123/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/109648/ |date=4 February 2012 }}, [[Kyiv Post]] (28 July 2011)</ref>) and the new, seen in everything from the architecture to the stores and to the people themselves. When the capital of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] was moved from [[Kharkiv]] to Kyiv many new buildings were commissioned to give the city "the gloss and polish of a capital".<ref name="Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv"/> In the discussions that centered on how to create a showcase city center, the current city center of [[Khreshchatyk]] and [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] (Independence Square) were not the obvious choices.<ref name="Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv"/> Some of the early, ultimately not materialised, ideas included a part of [[Pechersk, Kyiv|Pechersk]], [[Lypky]], [[European Square, Kyiv|European Square]] and [[Mykhailivska Square]].<ref name="Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv"/> The plans of building massive monuments (of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]) were also abandoned; due to lack of money (in the 1930s–1950s) and because of Kyiv's hilly landscape.<ref name="Forgotten Soviet Plans For Kyiv"/> Experiencing rapid population growth between the 1970s and the mid-1990s, the city has continued its consistent growth after the turn of the millennium. As a result, Kyiv's central districts provide a dotted contrast of new, modern buildings among the pale yellows, blues and greys of older apartments. Urban sprawl has gradually reduced, while population densities of suburbs has increased. The most expensive properties are located in the Pechersk, and Khreshchatyk areas. It is also prestigious to own a property in newly constructed buildings in the [[Kharkivskyi neighborhood, Kyiv|Kharkivskyi Raion]] or [[Obolon Raion|Obolon]] along the Dnieper.

[[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Ukrainian independence]] at the turn of the millennium has heralded other changes. Western-style residential complexes, modern [[nightclub]]s, classy restaurants and prestigious hotels opened in the centre. And most importantly, with the easing of the visa rules in 2005,<ref>[http://www.workpermit.com/news/2005_08_10/europe/ukraine.htm Workpermit.com].

[[File:Владимирская 54 Киев 2010 01.JPG|thumb|right|The [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|Ukrainian Academy of Sciences]] is based in Kyiv.]]
Scientific research is conducted in many institutes of higher education and, additionally, in many [[research institute]]s affiliated with the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|Ukrainian Academy of Sciences]]. Kyiv is home to [[Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine|Ukraine's ministry of education and science]], and is also noted for its contributions to medical and computer science research.

In 2016 UNIT Factory (Ukrainian National IT Factory) opened. It offers a completely new format of IT education. The education is completely free for all trainees subject to compliance with the terms of the program. Within this project are the Technology Companies' Development Center (TCDC), BIONIC University open inter-corporate IT-university, as well as two hi-tech laboratories—VR Lab (Crytek) and Smart City lab.<ref>https://kfund.ua/en/unit-factory-a-key-element-of-the-future-innovation-park-opened-in-kyiv/ |title=UNIT Factory, a key element of the future innovation park, opened in Kyiv</ref>

===University education===
[[File:Universidad Roja de Kiev.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kyiv University|National Taras Shevchenko University]]]]
Kyiv hosts many universities, the major ones being [[Kyiv University|Kyiv National Taras Shevchenko University]],<ref>See also:[http://www.univ.kiev.ua/ Kyiv University official website].

While education traditionally remains largely in the hands of the state there are several accredited private institutions in the city.

===Secondary education===
There are about 530 general secondary schools and ca. 680 nursery schools and [[kindergarten]]s in Kyiv.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Vilenchuk|first1=S. R.|last2=Yatsuk|first2=T.B.

==Transportation==
{{main|Transport in Kyiv}}

===Local public transport===
[[File:ЕлектроЛАЗ-301 фото 2.jpg|thumb|Trolleybus ElektroLAZ-301 at Sofia Square, passing by the statue of Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]
Local public transportation in Kyiv includes the [[Kyiv Metro|Metro]] (underground), [[bus]]es and [[marshrutka|minibuses]], [[trolleybus]]es, [[tram]]s, [[Taxicab|taxi]] and [[Kyiv Funicular|funicular]]. There is also an [[Kyiv Urban Electric Train|intra-city ring railway service]].

The publicly owned and operated Kyiv Metro is the fastest, the most convenient and affordable network that covers most, but not all, of the city. The Metro is expanding towards the city limits to meet growing demand, having three lines with a total length of {{convert|66.1|km|abbr=off}} and 51 stations (some of which are renowned architectural landmarks). The Metro carries around 1.422 million passengers daily<ref name="update">{{in lang|uk}} [http://kyiv.ukrstat.gov.ua/p.php3?c=2257 Kyiv General Department of Statistics, 2011]</ref> accounting for 38% of the Kyiv's public transport load. In 2011, the total number of trips exceeded 519 million.

The historic [[Trams in Kyiv|Kyiv tram system]] was the first electric tramway in the former Russian Empire and the third one in Europe after the [[Trams in Berlin|Berlin Straßenbahn]] and the [[Budapest]] tramway. The tram system consists of {{convert|139.9|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track,<ref>For a 2004 plan of the Kyiv tram, please see [http://www.mashke.org/kievtram/history/schemes/2004/2004-tram.jpg mashke.org]</ref> including {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} two [[Kyiv Light Rail|Rapid Tram]] lines, served by 21 routes with the use of 523 tram cars. Once a well maintained and widely used method of transport, the system is now gradually being phased out in favor of buses and trolleybuses.

The [[Kyiv Funicular]] was constructed during 1902–1905. It connects the historic [[Old Kyiv|Uppertown]], and the lower commercial neighborhood of [[Podil]] through the steep [[Saint Vladimir Hill]] overseeing the Dnieper River. The line consists of only two stations.

All public road transport (except for some minibuses) is operated by the united [[Kyivpastrans]] municipal company. It is heavily subsidized by the city.

The Kyiv public transport system, except for taxi, uses a simple [[flat rate]] tariff system regardless of distance traveled: tickets or tokens must be purchased each time a vehicle is boarded. [[Digital ticket]] system is already established in Kyiv Metro, with plans for other transport modes. Discount passes are available for grade school and higher education students. Pensioners use public transportation free. There are monthly passes in all combinations of public transportation. Ticket prices are regulated by the city government, and the cost of one ride is far lower than in Western Europe.

The [[Taxicab|taxi]] market in Kyiv is expansive but not regulated. In particular, the taxi fare per kilometer is not regulated. There is a fierce competition between private taxi companies.

===Roads and bridges===
Kyiv represents the focal point of Ukraine's "national roads" system, thus linked by road to all cities of the country. [[international E-road network|European route]]s [[File:Tabliczka E40.svg|35px|link=European route E40]], [[File:Tabliczka E95.svg|35px|link=European route E95]] and [[File:Tabliczka E373.svg|35px|link=European route E373]] intersect in Kyiv.

There are 8 over-[[Dnieper]] bridges and dozens of [[grade separation|grade-separated]] intersections in the city. Several new intersections are under construction. There are plans to build a full-size, fully grade-separated [[ring road]] around Kyiv.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fakty.ua/140163-masshtabnoe-stroitelstvo |title=Азаров дал добро на строительство кольцевой дороги вокруг Киева – Газета "ФАКТЫ и комментарии" |publisher=Fakty.ua |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/news/251194.html |title=Вторая кольцевая дорога вокруг Киева обойдется в $5-5,5 млрд. – Последние новости Киева – Однако в направлении окружной дороги уже вся земля выкуплена &#124; СЕГОДНЯ |publisher=Segodnya.ua |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://korrespondent.net/kyiv/1259650-azarov-prognoziruet-nachalo-stroitelstva-vtoroj-kolcevoj-dorogi-vokrug-kieva-v-2012-godu |title=Азаров прогнозирует начало строительства второй кольцевой дороги вокруг Киева в 2012 году &#124; Новости Киева |publisher=Korrespondent.net |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>

In 2009, Kyiv's roads were in poor technical condition and maintained inadequately.<ref>[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/203506.html Kyiv Administration: Roads Are In Poor Technical State Because They Have Reached End Of Their Service Lives And Annual Maintenance Volume Is Low] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616154750/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/203506.html |date=16 June 2009 }}, [[Ukrainian News Agency]] (12 June 2009)</ref>

[[Traffic congestion|Traffic jam]]s and lack of parking space are growing problems for all road transport services in Kyiv.

===Air transport===

Kyiv is served by two international passenger airports: the [[Boryspil International Airport|Boryspil Airport]] located {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=off}} away, and the smaller, municipally owned [[Kyiv International Airport (Zhuliany)|Zhulyany Airport]] on the southern outskirts of the city. There are also the [[Gostomel Airport|Gostomel cargo airport]] and additional three operating [[airfield]]s facilitating the [[Antonov|Antonov aircraft manufacturing company]] and [[general aviation]].

===Railways===
Railways are Kyiv's main mode of intracity and suburban transportation. The city has a developed railroad infrastructure including a long-distance passenger station, 6 cargo stations, depots, and repairing facilities. However, this system still fails to meet the demand for passenger service. Particularly, the [[Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi Railway Station]] is the city's only long-distance passenger terminal (''vokzal'').

Construction is underway for turning the large [[Darnytsia railway station]] on the left-bank part of Kyiv into a long-distance passenger hub, which may ease traffic at the central station.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.archunion.com.ua/proekt-new-006.shtml Archunion.com.ua] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206120010/http://www.archunion.com.ua/proekt-new-006.shtml |date=6 February 2007 }}. Retrieved 20 June 2006.</ref> [[Bridges in Kyiv|Bridges over the Dnieper River]] are another problem restricting the development of city's railway system. Presently, only one rail bridge out of two is available for intense train traffic. A new combined rail-auto bridge is under construction, as a part of Darnytsia project.

In 2011 the Kyiv city administration established a new 'Urban Train' for Kyiv. This service runs at standard 4- to 10-minute intervals throughout the day and follows a circular route around the city centre, which allows it to serve many of Kyiv's inner suburbs. Interchanges between the Kyiv Metro and [[Trams in Kyiv|Fast Tram]] exist at many of the urban train's station stops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ua.rian.ru/economy/20111004/78875513.html |title=Азаров запустил в Киеве городскую электричку &#124; Экономика &#124; РИА Новости – Украина |publisher=Ua.rian.ru |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=12 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425083357/http://ua.rian.ru/economy/20111004/78875513.html |archivedate=25 April 2012}}</ref>

Suburban 'Elektrichka' trains are serviced by the publicly owned [[Ukrainian Railways]]. The suburban train service is fast, and unbeatably safe in terms of traffic accidents. But the trains are not reliable, as they may fall significantly behind schedule, may not be safe in terms of crime, and the ''elektrichka'' cars are poorly maintained and are overcrowded in [[rush hour]]s.

There are 5 ''elektrichka'' directions from Kyiv:
*[[Nizhyn]] (north-eastern)
*[[Hrebinka]] (south-eastern)
*[[Myronivka]] (southern)
*[[Fastiv]] (south-western)
*[[Korosten]] (western)

More than a dozen of ''elektrichka'' stops are located within the city allowing residents of different neighborhoods to use the suburban trains.
