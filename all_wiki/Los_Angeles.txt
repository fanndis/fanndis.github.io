Los Angeles created the first municipal [[zoning]] ordinance in the United States. On September 14, 1908, the [[Los Angeles City Council, 1889–1909|Los Angeles City Council]] promulgated residential and industrial land use zones. The new ordinance established three residential zones of a single type, where industrial uses were prohibited. The proscriptions included barns, lumber yards, and any industrial land use employing machine-powered equipment. These laws were enforced against industrial properties after-the-fact. These prohibitions were in addition to existing activities that were already regulated as nuisances. These included explosives warehousing, gas works, oil-drilling, slaughterhouses, and [[Tannery|tanneries]]. Los Angeles City Council also designated seven industrial zones within the city. However, between 1908 and 1915, Los Angeles City Council created various exceptions to the broad proscriptions that applied to these three residential zones, and as a consequence, some industrial uses emerged within them. There are two differences from the 1908 Residence District Ordinance and later zoning laws in the United States. First, the 1908 laws did not establish a comprehensive zoning map as the [[Zoning in the United States#Origins and history|1916 New York City Zoning Ordinance]] did. Second, the residential zones did not distinguish types of housing; it treated apartments, hotels, and detached-single-family housing equally.<ref name="weiss80">{{cite book|title=The Rise of the Community Builders: The American Real Estate Industry and Urban Land Planning|author=Weiss, Marc A|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0-231-06505-4|location=New York|pages=80{{endash}}86}}</ref>

During [[United States home front during World War II|World War II]], Los Angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing, such as shipbuilding and aircraft. [[California Shipbuilding Corporation|Calship]] built hundreds of [[Liberty Ship]]s and [[Victory Ship]]s on Terminal Island, and the Los Angeles area was the headquarters of six of the country's major aircraft manufacturers ([[Douglas Aircraft Company]], [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes Aircraft]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[North American Aviation]], [[Northrop Corporation]], and [[Vultee Aircraft|Vultee]]). During the war, more aircraft were produced in one year than in all the pre-war years since the Wright brothers flew the first airplane in 1903, combined. Manufacturing in Los Angeles skyrocketed, and as [[William S.

Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes because of its location on the [[Ring of Fire|Pacific Ring of Fire]].

==== Overview ====
The city's street patterns generally follow a [[grid plan]], with uniform block lengths and occasional roads that cut across blocks. However, this is complicated by rugged terrain, which has necessitated having different grids for each of the valleys that Los Angeles covers. Major streets are designed to move large volumes of traffic through many parts of the city, many of which are extremely long; [[Sepulveda Boulevard]] is {{convert|43|mi}} long, while [[Foothill Boulevard (Southern California)|Foothill Boulevard]] is over {{convert|60|mi}} long, reaching as far east as San Bernardino. Drivers in Los Angeles suffer from one of the worst rush hour periods in the world, according to an annual traffic index by navigation system maker, [[TomTom]]. LA drivers spend an additional 92 hours in traffic each year. During the peak rush hour there is 80% congestion, according to the index.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/04/01/worst-cities-traffic-usa-los-angeles/70762026/|title=Los Angeles tops worst cities for traffic in USA|website=USA TODAY|accessdate=December 31, 2015}}</ref>

Los Angeles is often characterized by the presence of [[low-rise]] buildings. Outside of a few centers such as [[Downtown Los Angeles|Downtown]], [[Warner Center]], [[Century City]], [[Koreatown, Los Angeles|Koreatown]], [[Miracle Mile, Los Angeles|Miracle Mile]], [[Hollywood]], and [[Westwood, Los Angeles|Westwood]], skyscrapers and high-rise buildings are not common. The few skyscrapers built outside of those areas often stand out above the rest of the surrounding landscape. Most construction is done in separate units, rather than [[Curtain wall (architecture)|wall-to-wall]]. That being said, Downtown Los Angeles itself has many buildings over 30 stories, with fourteen over 50 stories, and two over 70 stories, the tallest of which is the [[Wilshire Grand Center]]. Also, Los Angeles is increasingly becoming a city of apartments rather than single family dwellings, especially in the dense inner city and [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|Westside]] neighborhoods.

Los Angeles has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb'' on the coast and most of downtown, ''Csa'' near the metropolitan region to the west), and receives just enough annual precipitation to avoid [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSh)'',<ref name="Peel">{{cite journal|author1=Peel, M.

The Los Angeles area is also subject to phenomena typical of a [[microclimate]], causing extreme variations in temperature in close physical proximity to each other. For example, the average July maximum temperature at the [[Santa Monica Pier]] is {{convert|70|F}} whereas it is {{convert|95|F}} in Canoga Park, {{convert|15|mi}} away.<ref name="climateofCA">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/CALIFORNIA.htm|title=Climate of California|publisher=Western Regional Climate Center|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref> The city, like much of the southern California coast, is subject to a late spring/early summer weather phenomenon called "[[June Gloom]]".

Downtown Los Angeles averages {{convert|14.93|in|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually, mainly occurring between November and March,<ref name="NCDC-CANOGA" /> generally in the form of moderate rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall during winter storms. Rainfall is usually higher in the hills and coastal slopes of the mountains because of [[orographic]] uplift. Summer days are usually rainless. Rarely, an incursion of moist air from the south or east can bring brief thunderstorms in late summer, especially to the mountains. The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the inland and mountain areas get considerably more. Years of average rainfall are rare. The usual pattern is year to year variability, with a short string of dry years of {{convert|5|–|10|in|abbr=on|mm}} rainfall, followed by one or two wet years with more than {{convert|20|in|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name="NCDC-CANOGA" /> Wet years are usually associated with warm water [[El Niño]] conditions in the Pacific, dry years with cooler water [[La Niña]] episodes. A series of rainy days can bring floods to the lowlands and mudslides to the hills, especially after [[wildfire]]s have denuded the slopes.

Both freezing temperatures and snowfall are extremely rare in the city basin and along the coast, with the last occurrence of a {{convert|32|F}} reading at the downtown station being January 29, 1979;<ref name="NCDC-CANOGA" /> freezing temperatures occur nearly every year in valley locations while the mountains within city limits typically receive snowfall every winter.

Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the [[United States Clean Air Act|Clean Air Act]]. When the act was passed, California was unable to create a [[State Implementation Plan]] that would enable it to meet the new air quality standards, largely because of the level of pollution in Los Angeles generated by older vehicles.<ref>“Early Implementation of the Clean Air Act of 1970 in California.” EPA Alumni Association.

July 12, 2016.</ref> More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating [[low-emission vehicle]]s. Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years because of aggressive steps to reduce it, which include [[Electric car|electric]] and [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] cars, improvements in [[mass transit]], and other measures.

Los Angeles is also home to the nation's largest urban [[oil field]].

The charter of the City of Los Angeles ratified by voters in 1999 created a system of advisory neighborhood councils that would represent the diversity of stakeholders, defined as those who live, work or own property in the neighborhood. The neighborhood councils are relatively autonomous and spontaneous in that they identify their own boundaries, establish their own bylaws, and elect their own officers. There are about 90 neighborhood councils.

Residents of Los Angeles elect [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors|supervisors]] for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th supervisorial districts.
