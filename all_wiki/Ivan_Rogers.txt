'''Sir Mark Ivan Rogers''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCMG}} (born March 1960) is a former senior British [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|civil servant]], who was the [[List of Permanent Representatives of the United Kingdom to the European Union|Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the European Union]] from 4 November 2013 until his resignation on 3 January 2017.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/88c29514-d1b0-11e6-9341-7393bb2e1b51|title=Britain's EU ambassador resigns weeks before Brexit talks|last=Barker|first=Alex|date=3 January 2017|website=Financial Times|access-date=2017-01-03}}</ref>

==Education==
Rogers was educated at [[Bournemouth School]] in his hometown, the south-coast town of [[Bournemouth]] in Dorset,<ref name=Politico>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/camerons-sherpa/|title=Ivan Rogers – Cameron's sherpa – Profile of UK's permanent representative|work=European Voice, Politico.EU|author=Tim Jones|date=12 November 2013|accessdate=2017-01-05}}</ref> at which his father taught history.<ref name=Politico/> After a gap year in [[Bremen]], in north-western Germany, he studied History for three years at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] at the [[University of Oxford]], followed by the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris. This was followed by another three years at Balliol, at which he pursued doctoral studies in the history of socio-biology and eugenic thinking on the political left, though he did not finish his degree.<ref name=Politico/>

== Career ==
Rogers successfully applied for a place on the civil service's 'fast track', and chose the [[Department of Health and Social Security]]. In 1992, he was seconded to the Treasury and did not return to his former department.<ref name=Politico/> He served in the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], including as [[Private Secretary]], to [[Kenneth Clarke]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. He then was seconded to the [[European Commission]] as Chief of Staff to [[Leon Brittan|Sir Leon Brittan]], returning to be Director, European Strategy and Policy and later Director of Budget and Public Finances under Gordon Brown.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/people/ivan-rogers|title=Sir Ivan Rogers KCMG&nbsp;– GOV.UK|website=gov.uk|access-date=2016-03-19}}</ref>

In 2003, Rogers was chosen to succeed [[Jeremy Heywood|Jeremy (later Sir Jeremy) Heywood]] as the [[Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister]], [[Tony Blair]]. After three years in this role, Rogers left the [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|civil service]] in 2006 to become Head of the UK Public Sector Group at [[Citigroup]]. In 2010 Rogers transferred to be Head of the Public Sector Industry Group, UK and Ireland, at [[Barclays Capital]] from 2010 to 2011.<ref name=":0"/>

In 2012, Rogers returned to the civil service as the Prime Minister's Adviser for Europe and Global Issues and the Head of the European and Global Issues Secretariat, based in the Prime Minister's Office at [[Number 10 Downing Street|Number 10]], replacing [[Jon Cunliffe]] who had become the senior British diplomat at the EU. On Cunliffe's move to the [[Bank of England]] the next year, Rogers succeeded him again, moving to [[List of Permanent Representatives of the United Kingdom to the European Union|Brussels]] in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/change-of-uk-permanent-representative-to-european-union|title=Change of UK Permanent Representative to European Union&nbsp;– Press releases&nbsp;– GOV.UK|website=gov.uk|access-date=2017-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/camerons-sherpa/|title=Ivan Rogers&nbsp;– Cameron's sherpa|date=11 December 2013|newspaper=POLITICO|access-date=2017-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-chooses-europhile-ivan-rogers-to-represent-uk-in-brussels-8749073.html|title=David Cameron chooses 'Europhile' Ivan Rogers to represent UK in|date=6 August 2013|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=2017-01-03}}</ref>

As of 2015, Rogers was paid a salary of between £170,000 and £174,999 by the Foreign Office, making him one of the 328 most highly paid people in the British public sector at that time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/492289/150K_senior_salaries.csv/preview|title=Senior officials 'high earners' salaries as at 30 September 2015&nbsp;– GOV.UK|date=17 December 2015|website=gov.uk|access-date=2016-03-11}}</ref>

Following the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|Brexit referendum]] in June 2016, Rogers became a key civil servant in the negotiations to leave.

==Personal views of the EU and resignation==

In December 2016, an internal memo Rogers had written suggesting difficulties for agreement was leaked.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/15/post-brexit-trade-deal-could-take-10-years-still-fail-warns/|title=Post-Brexit trade deal could take up to 10 years and still fail, warns UK's EU ambassador|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-01-03}}</ref> According to this leaked memo, Sir Ivan privately held the view that a settlement between the UK and the European Union might not be reached for 10 years, if at all, which did not reflect the Government's view. Questions were raised in the press whether Downing Street could any longer have confidence in his advice.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/15/sir-ivan-rogers-led-david-cameron-european-doom-would-theresa/|title=Sir Ivan Rogers led David Cameron to European doom. Why would Theresa May listen to him on Brexit?|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-01-03}}</ref> He resigned on 3 January 2017,<ref name=":1"/> nine months ahead of the nominal end of his posting in October 2017.

On 11 October 2018, in Cambridge,<ref>Trinity College, Cambridge. October 2018.[https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/events/brexit-as-a-revolution/] Rogers]</ref> Rogers delivered a lecture on "Brexit as Revolution", in which he said that he continued to think that the risks of an accidental "no deal" Brexit caused by persistent British misreading of others' incentives and views, and by the EU's frequent inability to comprehend [[UK politics]], were higher than was in the price.<ref>[https://share.trin.cam.ac.uk/sites/public/Comms/Rogers_brexit_as_revolution.pdf Ivan Rogers – Cambridge 2018]</ref>

In a lecture that Rogers delivered on 13 December 2018 at the University of Liverpool he said that the EU was always adroit at reframing things that have already been agreed, such as [[Brexit#Terminology and etymology|the "backstop"]], in ways that "make the medicine slip down".<ref>[https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2018/12/13/full-speech-sir-ivan-rogers-on-brexit/ Sir Ivan Rogers on Brexit, University of Liverpool]</ref>

Rogers was very critical of the strategy pursued by the British team in their negotiations with the EU following the triggering of Article 50. On 4 March 2019, while speaking to the Institute for Government, he pointed out the similarities in the tactics adopted by Theresa May's government and the tactics used by David Cameron's government in their renegotiations with the EU prior to the 2016 referendum. He said that May and her advisers' approach was to attempt to deal directly with the leaders of the major governments within the EU but the "reflex in the British system (is) always to think that we can deal direct with the organ grinders and not the monkeys: it never works like that. It didn't work like that in the Cameron renegotiation either. That stuff is not done in the way British politics works, leader to leader. It's done via the bureaucrats, and the sherpas, and the people at the top of the institutions."<ref>{{cite news |title=May 'did not understand EU when she triggered Brexit' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/04/theresa-may-did-not-understand-eu-when-she-triggered-brexit |newspaper=The Guardian |date=5 March 2019}}</ref>
