===Sexual harassment and pornography allegations===

During the [[2017 Westminster sexual scandals]] revelations, a Cabinet Office inquiry was started into allegations Green sent suggestive text messages and "fleetingly" touched the knee of a young Conservative activist. He disputes this, stating it's "absolutely and completely untrue that I’ve ever made any sexual advances on Ms [Kate] Maltby".<ref>{{cite news |last=Weaver |first=Matthew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/01/damian-green-denies-making-sexual-advances-towards-kate-maltby-tory-activist |title=Damian Green denies making sexual advances towards young Tory activist |work=The Guardian |date=1 November 2017 |accessdate=1 December 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104170721/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/01/damian-green-denies-making-sexual-advances-towards-kate-maltby-tory-activist |archive-date=4 November 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Both [[Baroness Kennedy]] and journalist Rosamund Urwin stated that Maltby had made the claims to them over a year before making them public.

During this investigation, allegations emerged that pornography had been found on Green's work computer when he was arrested over leaks in 2008.

On 20 December 2017, Green was removed from his position; it was found that he had lied to colleagues over pornography found on his computer. The report concluded that Green's conduct as a Minister had "generally been both professional and proper", but that regarding the allegations by Maltby, although the private nature of their meetings meant that it was "not possible to reach a definitive conclusion" regarding his behaviour towards her, the report found her account to be "plausible".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/670198/SUMMARY_OF_THE_CABINET_SECRETARY_S_REPORT_ON_ALLEGATIONS_ABOUT_DAMIAN_GREEN_S_CONDUCT.pdf |title=SUMMARY OF THE CABINET SECRETARY'S REPORT ON ALLEGATIONS ABOUT DAMIAN GREEN'S CONDUCT |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223102712/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/670198/SUMMARY_OF_THE_CABINET_SECRETARY_S_REPORT_ON_ALLEGATIONS_ABOUT_DAMIAN_GREEN_S_CONDUCT.pdf |archive-date=23 December 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In his resignation letter, Green said that he deeply regretted the distress to Maltby that the reaction to her article about him had caused, and although maintaining that he did not recognise the events described in it, he "clearly made her feel uncomfortable" and apologised for doing so.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kentish |first=Ben |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/damian-green-quits-latest-resignation-letter-in-full-theresa-may-a8121291.html |title=Damian Green's resignation letter in full: read it here |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223075510/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/damian-green-quits-latest-resignation-letter-in-full-theresa-may-a8121291.html |archive-date=23 December 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Theresa May had asked him to resign and accepted his resignation.

A few days later, Green faced calls to stand down as an MP, following the disclosure of a "dirty tricks" campaign which appeared to target his accuser.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/24/damian-green-faces-calls-stand-mp-accusation-dirty-tricks-against/|title=Damian Green faces calls to stand down as MP after accusation of 'dirty tricks' against Kate Maltby|first=Gordon|last=Rayner|date=24 December 2017|newspaper=The Telegraph|access-date=2 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203065948/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/24/damian-green-faces-calls-stand-mp-accusation-dirty-tricks-against/|archive-date=3 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It emerged that text messages passed to the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'', allegedly sent between Maltby and Green before she made her complaint, had been edited and rewritten in order to inaccurately suggest that Maltby, rather than Green, had encouraged a continued close relationship and solicited a meeting between the two.<ref name="thetimes.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/damian-green-accused-of-dirty-tricks-over-leaked-text-messages-92t2jzwvj|title=Damian Green accused of 'dirty tricks' over leaked text messages|first=Tom Harper, Caroline Wheeler and|last=Jon&nbsp;Ungoed‑Thomas|date=24 December 2017|newspaper=The Times|access-date=2 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203065401/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/damian-green-accused-of-dirty-tricks-over-leaked-text-messages-92t2jzwvj|archive-date=3 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> After contacting Maltby prior to publication, the ''Mail on Sunday'' corrected one series of messages and the newspaper later issued a further post-publication correction acknowledging that it had published a second forged message and falsely attributed it to her.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} The faked message and subsequent article falsely accused of her of having flirtatiously texted Green that she regretted his absence from his party, because in his stead one of his aides had "been smooching the room on your behalf x".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/mos-corrects-story-based-on-damian-green-texts-after-journalist-maltby-says-they-were-crudely-edited/|title=MoS corrects story based on Damian Green texts after journalist Maltby says they were 'crudely edited' – Press Gazette|website=www.pressgazette.co.uk|date=2 January 2018|access-date=2 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203065028/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/mos-corrects-story-based-on-damian-green-texts-after-journalist-maltby-says-they-were-crudely-edited/|archive-date=3 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Conservative MP [[Anna Soubry]], previously an ally of Green, and like him a Remain voter, told the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' that attempts to smear Maltby were "wrong and shameful". Another Conservative MP said: "It appears that Green's allies barely paused for breath after he apologised for the distress caused to Kate Maltby before launching an attack. It smacks of a dirty tricks campaign and is unhelpful to the government when it is still dealing with the fallout of the Westminster harassment scandal."<ref name="thetimes.co.uk"/> Maltby and her supporters had accused Green of also being behind a negative, anonymously-briefed attack on her written by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' journalist [[Andrew Pierce]]. Her parents, in a statement, responded angrily to claims made by Pierce that they disapproved of her actions and condemned "the attempted campaign in certain sections of the media to denigrate and intimidate her and other witnesses".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/24/kate-maltby-press-war-risks-leveson-revival|title=The press's war on Kate Maltby risks a Leveson revival|first=Jane|last=Martinson|date=24 December 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=2 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202165157/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/dec/24/kate-maltby-press-war-risks-leveson-revival|archive-date=2 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Writing in the ''Sunday Times'', Maltby alleged that the ''Daily Mail'' attack had been coordinated by Green's team and formed part of a broader strategy of witness intimidation. Maltby alleged that two other women had intended to make allegations against Green, but "as a result" of the ''Daily Mail''{{'}} coverage of her own complaint, "immediately backed out".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/kate-maltby-i-wanted-just-one-word-so-mr-green-are-you-sorry-now-kltwxbgg3|title=Kate Maltby: I wanted just one word.
