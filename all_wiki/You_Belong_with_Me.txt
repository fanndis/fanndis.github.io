Craig Rosen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' believes "You Belong with Me"'s plot is "confessional" and regards scenarios themed with high school, while Swift "is the girl next door who's had her heart broken and takes refuge in music".<ref name="hollywoodreporterreview" /> Lucy Davies of the [[BBC]] noted, "Swift deals in the prosaic imagery of high school boys".<ref name="bbc" /> In one [[verse (popular music)|verse]], Swift contrasts herself with her friend's girlfriend and states, "She wears high heels, I wear sneakers / She's cheer captain, I'm on the bleachers", which Davies interpreted as the song's protagonist feeling envy towards cheerleaders, in particular, the one dating her male friend.<ref name="bbc" /> In the choruses, Swift attempts "to persuade some boy to come to his senses and submit to her everygirl charms".<ref name="washingtonpost" />

==Music video==
[[File:Taylor Swift - You Belong with Me music video 02.JPG|thumb|Swift portrays the [[antagonist]], a popular, brunette [[cheerleader]], in the music video for "You Belong with Me"]]
The song's accompanying music video was directed by [[Roman White]]. In the video, Swift portrays both the [[protagonist]] and [[antagonist]], which she respectively described as "the nerd, who is pining away for this guy that she can't have" and "the popular girl."<ref name="hooksupwithtill" /> Swift described the popular girl's persona as "horrible and scary and intimidating and perfect".<ref name="onset">{{cite episode|title=On the Set Behind the Scenes 'You Belong with Me'|minutes=20:45|series=Taylor Swift: On the Set|network=[[Great American Country]]|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref> Her love interest is portrayed by American actor [[Lucas Till]]; Swift met Till while acting on the set of ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]'' in April 2008. She later asked him to act in the video, as she was intrigued by his "cool look", embodying a "dreamy guy".<ref name="onset" /> In regards to his acting on the video, Swift said, "He's absolutely perfect for the part and really fun to be around, too."<ref name="hooksupwithtill" /> According to her, the video's plot is "charming"; she also said that, "the whole video, I'm just sitting there pining away, wishing I could be in her position."<ref name="onset" /> In regards to the video's conclusion, White explained that Swift "becomes who she really is", while Swift thought it was a happy ending.<ref name="onset" /> Swift commented, "One of my favorite things about this video is that there wasn't a standard performance scene. This video was pretty much all story line and I'm narrating it in the moment, basically narrating while all this is happening around me."<ref name="onset" />

The video was shot in two days in [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]] and [[Hendersonville, Tennessee]].<ref name="hooksupwithtill" /> On the first day of filming, Swift used a [[body double]] in order for both Swift, as the protagonist and antagonist, to appear in one shot.<ref name="onset" /> In a scene where she appeared dancing, White replaced Swift's routine with one having no rhythm; she recalled, "It was some of the most fun I'd had in a long time, just freaking out and doing the dumbest moves."<ref name="onset" /> On the second day, they first filmed a prom scene and, lastly, the football game, both being filmed at [[Pope John Paul II High School (Hendersonville, Tennessee)|Pope John Paul II High School]]. The school supplied many students as extras, including football players, band members, cheerleaders and students. The final prom scene used the school's decorations for its real prom the next night. When filming for a touchdown, Till was unable to catch the ball, furthering the length of the shoot.<ref name="onset" /> "You put a lot of good solid effort in it and it looks good," Swift stated about filming.<ref name="onset" />

The video commences with Till arguing with his girlfriend through a phone call. As soon as Swift, as the protagonist, notices, they begin to communicate by holding up signs through their adjoining bedroom windows. Till closes his curtains, and Swift holds up a sign saying, "I love you". As the song's chorus approaches, Swift starts to sing and dance in front of a mirror, changing to different clothing multiple times reflecting various high school [[adolescent cliques|cliques]] including a goth, a hippie, and a skater. Afterward, Swift is sitting in a bench while reading a book. Till arrives and the two talk. Then, Swift, as the antagonist, arrives in a red convertible car and Till gets in it; Swift, the antagonist, kisses him and gives a hostile look towards the protagonist. Suddenly, the antagonist Swift is seen cheerleading at a football game while Swift's other persona is in the bleachers, performing in the school band. After scoring the winning touchdown, Till moves toward his girlfriend and finds her flirting with a teammate, resulting in a heated argument which results in their breakup. Meanwhile, Swift the protagonist stares in amazement. Back looking at each other through their bedroom windows, Till and Swift again communicate through signs. Till asks Swift the protagonist if she was attending prom and she responds, "no, studying". Swift, however, notices Till has a dejected expression as he leaves, and she changes her mind. Shortly after, Swift is seen entering prom with a white dress, no longer looking like a nerd, while all her peers stare in amazement. When Till spots her, he walks towards her and Swift the antagonist, in a red dress, attempts to stop him, but he ignores her. Ending the video, Till and Swift reveal folded signs saying "I love you" and kiss while Swift the antagonist stares at them in anger.

The video deals with themes such as fitting in and staying true to oneself. As of January 2020, the video has over 1 billion views on [[YouTube]], making it the first [[country music]] video on the site that reached that milestone.
