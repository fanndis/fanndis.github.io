A '''deed poll''' (plural: '''deeds poll''' or '''deed polls''') is a legal document binding only to a single person or several persons acting jointly to express an active intention. It is, strictly speaking, not a [[contract]] because it binds only one [[party (law)|party]] and expresses an intention instead of a promise.

==Use for changing name==
{{main|Deed of change of name}}
The most common use is a [[name change]] through a deed of change of name (often referred to simply as a ''deed poll''). Deeds poll are used for this purpose in countries including the United Kingdom,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll|title=Change your name by deed poll - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-05-10}}</ref> Australia,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pch.health.wa.gov.au/~/media/Files/Corporate/general%20documents/CAHS/PC191_Change_of_Patient_Name.pdf|title=PC191_Change_of_Patient_Name.pdf|website=pch.health.wa.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2020-05-10}}</ref> Ireland,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html|title=Changing your name by deed poll|website=citizensinformation.ie|language=en|access-date=2020-05-16}}</ref> Hong Kong and Singapore. In the UK, a deed poll can also be used to change a child's name, as long as everyone with parental responsibility for the child consents to it and the child does not object to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/relationships_e/relationships_birth_certificates_and_changing_your_name_e/changing_your_name.htm|title=Changing your name|website=AdviceGuide UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116011355/http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/relationships_e/relationships_birth_certificates_and_changing_your_name_e/changing_your_name.htm|archive-date=16 November 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> The child's parents execute the deed poll on the child's behalf. In some other jurisdictions, a person may simply start using a new name without any formal legal process. The usual requirements are that the new name must be used exclusively and that the change must not be made with intent to [[fraud|defraud]]. In English law a person must notify every creditor of a change of name by deed poll.

In [[Australia]], prior to 1 November 2000,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.justice.tas.gov.au/bdm/changeofname/deed_poll_searches_(pre-2000)|title=Births Deaths and Marriages : Deed poll searches (pre-2000)|website=www.justice.tas.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-02-05}}</ref> name change was formerly accomplished by deed poll but now is done by completing a Change of Name form.

==Other uses==
Another common use is to [[Partition (law)|partition]] land. This form of deed poll is commonly used in Hong Kong.

A deed poll may also be used (in England and Wales) for clergy of the Church of England to relinquish their [[holy orders]].

Bonds, powers of attorney, and wills are also good examples of deed polls as they are made by grantor alone.{{fact|date=January 2020}}

==Origin of the term==
The term "deed", also known in this context as a "specialty", is common to signed written undertakings not supported by consideration: the seal (even if not a literal wax seal but only a notional one referred to by the execution formula, "signed, sealed and delivered", or even merely "executed as a deed") is deemed to be the consideration necessary to support the obligation. "Poll" is an archaic legal term referring to documents with straight edges; these distinguished a deed binding only one person from one affecting more than a single person (an "[[indenture]]", so named during the time when such agreements would be written out repeatedly on a single sheet, then the copies separated by being irregularly torn or cut, i.e. "indented", so that each party had a document with corresponding tears, to discourage forgery).
