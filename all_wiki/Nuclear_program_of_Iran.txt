{{Nuclear power in Iran}}

The '''nuclear program of Iran''' has included several research sites, two [[uranium mine]]s, a [[Nuclear reactor technology|research reactor]], and uranium processing facilities that include three known [[Enriched uranium#Gas centrifuge|uranium enrichment plants]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL34544.pdf |title=Iran's Nuclear Program: Status |last=Kerr |first=Paul |publisher=Congressional Research Service |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=2 October 2012 }}</ref> In 1970, Iran ratified the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT),<ref name="npt">{{cite web

In 1981, Iranian officials concluded that the country's nuclear development should continue. Negotiations took place with France in the late 1980s and with Argentina in the early 1990s, and agreements were reached. In the 1990s, Russia formed a joint research organization with Iran, providing Iran with Russian nuclear experts and technical information.

In the 2000s, the revelation of Iran's clandestine uranium enrichment program raised concerns that it might be intended for non-peaceful uses. The IAEA launched an investigation in 2003 after an Iranian dissident group revealed undeclared nuclear activities carried out by Iran.<ref name="Armscontrolwonk.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/517/exiles-and-iran-intel |title=ArmsControlWonk: Exiles and Iran Intel |publisher=Armscontrolwonk.com |accessdate=26 October 2008}}</ref><ref name="ReferenceB">{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/gov2003-40.pdf |id=GOV/2003/40 |title=Implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency |accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref> In 2006, because of Iran's noncompliance with its NPT obligations, the [[United Nations Security Council]] demanded that Iran suspend its enrichment programs.

===1950s & 1960s===
The foundations for [[Iran]]'s nuclear program were laid on 5 March 1957, when a "proposed agreement for cooperation in research in the peaceful uses of atomic energy" was announced under the auspices of Eisenhower's [[Atoms for Peace|Atoms for Peace program]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/iran/irans-nuclear-program/p16811 |title=Iran's Nuclear Program – Council on Foreign Relations |publisher=Cfr.org |accessdate=4 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220182315/http://www.cfr.org/iran/irans-nuclear-program/p16811 |archive-date=20 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1967, the [[Tehran Nuclear Research Center]] (TNRC) was established, run by the [[Atomic Energy Organization of Iran]] (AEOI). The TNRC was equipped with a US-supplied, 5-megawatt nuclear [[research reactor]], which was fueled by [[highly enriched uranium]].<ref name=IAEA-untreaty-8866>{{Cite journal|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20614/volume-614-I-8866-English.pdf|title=Contract between the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran and the United States of America for the transfer of Enriched Uranium and Plutonium for a Research Reactor in Iran|journal=IAEA|publisher=United Nations|date=7 June 1967|accessdate=8 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nnsa.doe.gov/na-20/frrsnf.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924034225/http://www.nnsa.doe.gov/na-20/frrsnf.shtml|archive-date=24 September 2006|title=Foreign Research Reactor Spent Nuclear Fuel Acceptance|publisher=US National Nuclear Security Administration|accessdate=24 September 2006}}</ref>

Iran signed the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) in 1968 and ratified it in 1970, making Iran's nuclear program subject to IAEA verification.

A [[Central Treaty Organisation]] nuclear sciences institute<ref>MCKAY, H. The Cento Institute of Nuclear Science in Tehran. [[Nature]] 186, 513–515 (1960). https://doi.org/10.1038/186513a0</ref> was moved from Baghdad to Tehran after Iraq left CENTO.

===1970s===
The Shah approved plans to construct up to 23 nuclear power stations by 2000.<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RS21592.pdf Iran's Nuclear Program: Recent Developments]: "The Shah's plan to build 23 nuclear power reactors by the 1990s was regarded as grandiose, but not necessarily viewed as a "back door" to a nuclear weapons program, possibly because Iran did not then seek the technologies to enrich or reprocess its own fuel"</ref>
In March 1974, the Shah envisioned a time when the world's oil supply would run out, and declared, "Petroleum is a noble material, much too valuable to burn&nbsp;...

In 1975, the [[Erlangen]]/[[Frankfurt]] firm [[Kraftwerk Union AG]], a joint venture of [[Siemens AG]] and [[AEG]], signed a contract worth $4 to {{Nowrap|$6 billion}} to build the [[pressurized water reactor]] nuclear power plant. Construction of the two 1,196 [[MWe]], and was to have been completed in 1981.

In 1975 Sweden's 10 per cent share in [[Eurodif]] went to Iran. The French government subsidiary company [[Areva NC|Cogéma]] and the Iranian Government established the Sofidif (''Société franco–iranienne pour l'enrichissement de l'uranium par diffusion gazeuse'') enterprise with 60 and 40 per cent shares, respectively. In turn, Sofidif acquired a 25 per cent share in Eurodif, which gave Iran its 10 per cent share of Eurodif. Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi lent {{Nowrap|1 billion}} dollars (and another {{Nowrap|180 million}} dollars in 1977) for the construction of the Eurodif factory, to have the right of buying 10 per cent of the production of the site.

"President [[Gerald Ford]] signed a directive in 1976 offering [[Tehran]] the chance to buy and operate a U.S.-built reprocessing facility for extracting [[plutonium]] from nuclear reactor fuel. The deal was for a complete 'nuclear fuel cycle'."<ref name="wp1" >{{Cite news|author=Dafna Linzer|work=Washington Post |date=27 March 2005|title=Past Arguments Don't Square With Current Iran Policy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3983-2005Mar26.html}}</ref>
The Ford strategy paper said the "introduction of nuclear power will both provide for the growing needs of Iran's economy and free remaining oil reserves for export or conversion to petrochemicals."

===Post-revolution, 1979–1989===
Following the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Revolution]], most of the international nuclear cooperation with Iran was cut off. Kraftwerk Union stopped working at the Bushehr nuclear project in January 1979, with one reactor 50 per cent complete, and the other reactor 85 per cent complete, and they fully withdrew from the project in July 1979. The company said they based their action on Iran's non-payment of {{Nowrap|$450 million}} in overdue payments,<ref name="anti1" >{{cite web|url=http://www.antiwar.com/prather/?articleid=8308|title=ElBaradei Isn't Perfect|author=Gordon Prather|date=27 December 2005|publisher=Antiwar.com}}</ref> while other sources claim the construction was halted under pressure from the United States.<ref name=NRSBINT /><ref>[http://www.nti.org/db/nisprofs/russia/exports/rusiran/react.htm Russia: Nuclear Exports to Iran: Reactors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411115206/http://www.nti.org/db/nisprofs/russia/exports/rusiran/react.htm |date=11 April 2010 }} ''Nuclear Threat Initiative''</ref> The United States cut off the supply of highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel for the [[Tehran Nuclear Research Center]], which forced the reactor to shut down for a number of years.

In 1981, Iranian governmental officials concluded that the country's nuclear development should continue. Reports to the IAEA included that a site at Esfahan Nuclear Technology Center (ENTEC) would act "as the center for the transfer and development of nuclear technology, as well as contribute to the formation of local expertise and manpower needed to sustain a very ambitious program in the field of nuclear power reactor technology and fuel cycle technology." The IAEA also was informed about Entec's largest department, for materials testing, which was responsible for {{chem|UO|2}} pellet fuel fabrication and a chemical department whose goal was the conversion of [[Triuranium octoxide|{{chem|U|3|O|8}}]] to nuclear grade [[uranium dioxide|{{chem|UO|2}}]].<ref name=Hibbs83 />

In 1983, IAEA officials were keen to assist Iran in chemical aspects of reactor fuel fabrication, chemical engineering and design aspects of pilot plants for uranium conversion, corrosion of nuclear materials, LWR fuel fabrication, and pilot plant development for production of nuclear grade {{chem|UO|2}}.<ref name=Hibbs83 /> However, the US government "directly intervened" to discourage IAEA assistance in Iranian production of [[uranium dioxide|{{chem|UO|2}}]] and [[uranium hexafluoride|{{chem|UF|6}}]].<ref>{{cite web|title=US in 1983 stopped IAEA from helping Iran make UF6|url=http://www.geocities.com/thelasian/nucleafuel_iran.html|publisher=Platt's Nuclear Fuel|date=August 2003|author=Mark Hibbs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207122814/http://geocities.com/thelasian/nucleafuel_iran.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 February 2009}}</ref> A former US official said "we stopped that in its tracks."

In April 1984, West German intelligence reported that Iran might have a nuclear bomb within two years with uranium from Pakistan. The Germans leaked this news in the first public Western intelligence report of a post-revolutionary nuclear weapons program in Iran.<ref>Anthony H.

During the [[Iran–Iraq War]], the two Bushehr reactors were damaged by multiple Iraqi air strikes and work on the nuclear program came to a standstill. Iran notified the International Atomic Energy Agency of the blasts, and complained about international inaction and the use of French made missiles in the attack.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/publications/documents/infcircs/correspondence-between-president-atomic-energy-organization-iran-and-director-general |title=Correspondence between the President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and the Director General |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency |date=September 1984 |format=PDF |accessdate=28 March 2017 |id=INFCIRC/318 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/publications/documents/infcircs/telex-messages-director-general-president-atomic-energy-organization-iran |id=INFCIRC/346/Add.2 |date=27 November 1987 |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency |title=TelEx Messages to the Director General from the President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran |format=PDF |accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref> In late 2015, [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] revealed that Iran considered pursuing weapons of mass destruction during the war against Iraq.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-rafsanjani/iran-considered-nuclear-weapons-during-1980s-iraq-war-ex-president-says-idUSKCN0SN0E720151029 Iran considered nuclear weapons during 1980s Iraq war, ex-president says], Reuters, Sam Wilkin, 29 October 2015</ref>

In 1985, Iran began to put pressure on France in order to recover its debt from the Eurodif's investment and to get the enriched uranium delivered. French hostages were taken in Lebanon from spring 1985; in 1986, terror attacks were perpetrated in Paris and Eurodif manager [[Georges Besse]] was assassinated. In their investigation ''La République atomique, France-Iran le pacte nucléaire'', David Carr-Brown and [[Dominique Lorentz]] pointed to the Iranian intelligence services' responsibility. It was later ascertained, however, that the assassination was committed by the left-wing terror group [[Action directe (armed group)|Action directe]]. On 6 May 1988, French premier Jacques Chirac signed an accord with Iran: France agreed to accept Iran back in its share-holder status of Eurodif and to deliver it enriched uranium "without restrictions".

In 1987–88, [[Argentina]]'s [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] signed an agreement with Iran to help in converting the reactor from [[highly enriched uranium]] fuel to 19.75 per cent [[low-enriched uranium]], and to supply the low-enriched uranium to Iran.<ref name=IAEA-untreaty-8865-amendment>{{Cite journal|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201562/volume-1562-I-8865-English.pdf|title=Amendment to Agreement between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Government of Iran for assistance by the Agency to Iran in establishing a Research Reactor Project|journal=IAEA|publisher=United Nations|date=9 December 1988|accessdate=8 April 2010}}</ref> According to a report by the Argentine justice in 2006, during the late 1980s and early 1990s the US pressured Argentina to terminate its nuclear cooperation with Iran, and from early 1992 to 1994 negotiations between Argentina and Iran took place with the aim of re-establishing the three agreements made in 1987–88.<ref name="Argentine">{{cite web |title=Middle East News, Iraq, Iran current affairs|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HK15Ak03.html |publisher=Asia Times Online |accessdate=24 February 2008|date=15 November 2008}}</ref> Some have linked attacks such as the [[1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires]] and the [[AMIA bombing]] as part of an Iranian campaign to pressure Argentina into honoring the agreements.<ref>[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HK15Ak03.html Argentina's Iranian nuke connection], ''Gareth Porter'', 15 November 2006</ref><ref name=norton>Norton, Augustus Richard, ''Hezbollah: A Short History'',  Princeton University Press, 2007, p.79</ref> The uranium was delivered in 1993.<ref name=CNS-suppliers>{{cite web|url=http://cns.miis.edu/wmdme/flow/iran/reactor.htm|title=Foreign Suppliers to Iran's Nuclear Development|publisher=James Martin Center For Nonproliferation Studies|accessdate=26 September 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409171200/http://cns.miis.edu/wmdme/flow/iran/reactor.htm|archive-date=9 April 2010}}</ref>

===1990–2002===
From the beginning of the 1990s, [[Russia]] formed a joint research organization with Iran called ''Persepolis'' which provided Iran with Russian nuclear experts, and technical information. Five Russian institutions, including the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] helped Tehran to improve its missiles. The exchange of technical information with Iran was personally approved by the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] director Trubnikov.<ref name="Lunev" >[[Stanislav Lunev]].

After public allegations about Iran's previously undeclared nuclear activities, the IAEA launched an investigation that concluded in November 2003 that Iran had systematically failed to meet its obligations under its NPT safeguards agreement to report those activities to the IAEA, although it also reported no evidence of links to a nuclear weapons program. The IAEA Board of Governors delayed a formal finding of non-compliance until September 2005, and reported that non-compliance to the UN Security Council in February 2006. After the IAEA Board of Governors reported Iran's noncompliance with its safeguards agreement to the United Nations Security Council, the Council demanded that Iran suspend its enrichment programs. The Council imposed sanctions after Iran refused to do so. A May 2009 US Congressional Report suggested "the United States, and later the Europeans, argued that Iran's deception meant it should forfeit its right to enrich, a position likely to be up for negotiation in talks with Iran."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/2009_rpt/iran.html |title=Iran: Where We Are Today – A Report to the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate, One Hundred Eleventh Congress, May&nbsp;4, 2009 |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref>

In exchange for suspending its enrichment program, Iran has been offered "a long-term comprehensive arrangement which would allow for the development of relations and cooperation with Iran based on mutual respect and the establishment of international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program."<ref>{{cite web|title=Security council demands iran suspend uranium enrichment by August&nbsp;31, or face possible economic, diplomatic sanctions|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/sc8792.doc.htm|accessdate=24 February 2008|year=2008}}</ref> However, Iran has consistently refused to give up its enrichment program, arguing that the program is necessary for its energy security, that such "long term arrangements" are inherently unreliable, and would deprive it of its inalienable right to peaceful nuclear technology.

Estimating when Iran might possibly achieve nuclear "breakout" capability, defined as having produced a sufficient quantity of highly enriched uranium to fuel a weapon – if a working design for one existed and the political decision to assemble it was made – is uncertain.  A detailed analysis by physicists at the [[Federation of American Scientists]] concludes that such an estimate would depend on the total number and overall efficiency of the [[Gas centrifuge|centrifuges]] Iran has in operation, and the amount of low-enriched uranium it has stockpiled to serve as "feedstock" for a possible high-enrichment program.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL32048.pdf|title=Using Enrichment Capacity to Estimate Iran's Breakout Potential |last=Barzashka |first=Ivanka |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |date=21 January 2011 |accessdate=11 March 2012}}</ref> A 23 March 2012 [[US Congressional Research Service]] report quotes 24 February 2012 IAEA report saying that Iran has stockpiled 240 pounds of 20-per-cent-enriched uranium – an enrichment level necessary for medical applications – as an indication of their capacity to enrich to higher levels.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL32048.pdf |title=Iran: U.S. Concerns and Policy Responses |last=Katzman |first=Kenneth  |publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]] |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref> The authoritarian political culture of Iran may pose additional challenges to a scientific program requiring cooperation among many technical specialists.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/op-eds/crying-wolf-about-iranian-nuclear-bomb  |title=Crying Wolf About An Iranian Nuclear Bomb  |last=Hymans |first=Jacques E.C. |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=17 January 2012 |accessdate=27 April 2012}}</ref> Some experts argue that the intense focus on Iran's nuclear program detracts from a need for broader diplomatic engagement with the Islamic Republic.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.agenceglobal.com/index.php?show=article&Tid=2965 |title=Time To Face Te Truth About Iran |author1=Flynt Leveritt  |author2=Hillary Mann Leveritt  |name-list-style=amp |magazine=[[The Nation]] |date=7 February 2013 |accessdate=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/jun/06/ruthless-iran-can-deal-be-made/?pagination=false |title=Ruthless Iran:Can A Deal Be Made? |last=Cohen |first=Roger |work=New York Review of Books |date=21 May 2013}}</ref> [[United States Intelligence Community|US intelligence agency]] officials interviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in March 2012 said they continued to assess that Iran had not restarted its weaponization program, which the 2007 [[National Intelligence Estimate]] said Iran had discontinued in 2003, although they have found evidence that some weaponization-related activities have continued.

The EU-3 in return explicitly agreed to recognize Iran's nuclear rights and to discuss ways Iran could provide "satisfactory assurances" regarding its nuclear power program, after which Iran would gain easier access to modern technology. Iran signed an Additional Protocol on 18 December 2003, and agreed to act as if the protocol were in force, making the required reports to the IAEA and allowing the required access by IAEA inspectors, pending Iran's ratification of the Additional Protocol.

Under the terms of the Paris Agreement,<ref>[http://www.armscontrol.org/country/iran/ParisAgreement.asp]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522082429/http://www.armscontrol.org/country/iran/ParisAgreement.asp |date=22 May 2008 }}</ref> on 14 November 2004, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator announced a voluntary and temporary suspension of its uranium enrichment program (enrichment is not a violation of the NPT) and the voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol, after pressure from the United Kingdom, France, and Germany acting on behalf of the [[European Union]] (EU, known in this context as the ''[[EU-3]]''). The measure was said at the time to be a voluntary, confidence-building measure, to continue for some reasonable period of time (six months being mentioned as a reference) as negotiations with the EU-3 continued. On 24 November, Iran sought to amend the terms of its agreement with the EU to exclude a handful of the equipment from this deal for research work. This request was dropped four days later. According to Seyyed Hossein Mousavian, one of the Iranian representatives to the Paris Agreement negotiations, the Iranians made it clear to their European counterparts that Iran would not consider a permanent end to uranium enrichment:

{{quote|Before the Paris [Agreement] text was signed, Dr Rohani&nbsp;... stressed that they should be committed neither to speak nor even think of a cessation any more. The ambassadors delivered his message to their foreign ministers prior to the signing of the Paris agreed text&nbsp;... The Iranians made it clear to their European counterparts that if the latter sought a complete termination of Iran's nuclear fuel-cycle activities, there would be no negotiations. The Europeans answered that they were not seeking such a termination, only an assurance on the non-diversion of Iran's nuclear programme to military ends.<ref>[http://www.comw.org/pda/fulltext/06mousavian.pdf "Iran and the West: The Path to Nuclear Deadlock".

Iran ceased its implementation of the Additional Protocol in 2006, and also ceased all other cooperation with the IAEA beyond what Iran acknowledged it was required to provide under its safeguards agreement, after the IAEA Board of Governors decided, in February 2006, to report Iran's safeguards non-compliance to the UN Security Council.<ref name="IAEA-GOV/2006/15" /> The UN Security Council, invoking Chapter&nbsp;VII of the UN Charter, then passed Resolution 1737, which obligated Iran to implement the Additional Protocol.

======May 2007 Report======
On 30 July 2007, inspectors from the IAEA spent five hours at the Arak complex, the first such visit since April. Visits to other plants in Iran were expected during the following days. It has been suggested that access may have been granted in an attempt to head off further sanctions.<ref name="Reuters300707" >[https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSDAH02145320070730 UN inspectors revisit Iran's Arak heavy-water site], ''[[Reuters]]'', published 30 July 2007.

======August 2007 Report and Agreement between Iran and the IAEA======
An IAEA report to the Board of Governors on 30 August 2007 stated that Iran's Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz was operating "well below the expected quantity for a facility of this design," and that 12 of the intended 18 centrifuge cascades at the plant were operating. The report stated that the IAEA had "been able to verify the non-diversion of the declared nuclear materials at the enrichment facilities in Iran," and that longstanding issues regarding plutonium experiments and HEU contamination on spent fuel containers were considered "resolved." However, the report added that the Agency remained unable to verify certain aspects relevant to the scope and nature of Iran's nuclear program.

The report also outlined a work plan agreed by Iran and the IAEA on 21 August 2007. The work plan reflected agreement on "modalities for resolving the remaining safeguards implementation issues, including the long outstanding issues." According to the plan, these modalities covered all remaining issues regarding Iran's past nuclear program and activities. The IAEA report described the work plan as "a significant step forward," but added "the Agency considers it essential that Iran adheres to the time line defined therein and implements all the necessary safeguards and transparency measures, including the measures provided for in the Additional Protocol."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2007/gov2007-48.pdf |title=GOV/2007/48 – Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> Although the work plan did not include a commitment by Iran to implement the Additional Protocol, IAEA safeguards head [[Olli Heinonen]] observed that measures in the work plan "for resolving our outstanding issues go beyond the requirements of the Additional Protocol."<ref>{{cite web|title=Quote from Olli Heinonen, Head of IAEA Safeguards.|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2007/workplan_heinonen.html|accessdate=24 February 2008|year=2008}}</ref>

In late October 2007, according to the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', the head of the IAEA, Mohamed ElBaradei, stated that he had seen "no evidence" of Iran developing nuclear weapons. The IHT quoted ElBaradei as saying "We have information that there has been maybe some studies about possible weaponization. That's why we have said that we cannot give Iran a pass right now, because there is still a lot of question marks.&nbsp;... But have we seen Iran having the nuclear material that can readily be used into a weapon? No. Have we seen an active weaponization program? No." The IHT report went on to say that "ElBaradei said he was worried about the growing rhetoric from the U.S., which he noted focused on Iran's alleged intentions to build a nuclear weapon rather than evidence the country was actively doing so. If there is actual evidence, ElBaradei said he would welcome seeing it."<ref name="IHT_IAEA_rhetoric">{{cite web|title=UN nuclear watchdog chief expresses concern about anti-Iran rhetoric from US|work=International Herald Tribune|date=28 October 2007|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/28/america/NA-GEN-US-Iran.php|accessdate=29 October 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030064253/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/10/28/america/NA-GEN-US-Iran.php|archive-date=30 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

======November 2007 report======
15 November 2007, IAEA report found that on nine outstanding issues listed in the August 2007 workplan, including experiments on the P-2 centrifuge and work with uranium metals, "Iran's statements are consistent with&nbsp;... information available to the agency," but it warned that its knowledge of Tehran's present atomic work was shrinking due to Iran's refusal to continue voluntarily implementing the Additional Protocol, as it had done in the past under the October 2003 Tehran agreement and the November 2004 Paris agreement. The only remaining issues were traces of HEU found at one location, and allegations by US intelligence agencies based on a laptop computer allegedly stolen from Iran which reportedly contained nuclear weapons-related designs. The IAEA report also stated that Tehran continues to produce LEU. Iran has declared it has a right to peaceful nuclear technology under the NPT, despite Security Council demands that it cease its nuclear enrichment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2007/gov2007-58.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – gov2007-58.doc |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref>

With respect to the report, IAEA Director Mohammad ElBaradei stated that "We have managed to clarify all the remaining outstanding issues, including the most important issue, which is the scope and nature of Iran's enrichment programme" with the exception of a single issue, "and that is the alleged weaponization studies that supposedly Iran has conducted in the past."<ref>{{cite web|title=Latest Iran Safeguards Report Circulated to IAEA Board|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2008/iranreport0208.html|accessdate=24 February 2008|year=2008}}</ref>

According to the report, the IAEA shared intelligence with Iran recently provided by the US regarding "alleged studies" on a nuclear weaponization program.

The February 2008 IAEA report states that the Agency has "not detected the use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies, nor does it have credible information in this regard."<ref name=IAEA_022208 />

======May 2008 report======
On 26 May 2008, the IAEA issued another regular report on the implementation of safeguards in Iran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2008/gov2008-15.pdf%7cpublisher=IAEA%7cyear=2008|title=IAEA Publications|work=iaea.org}}</ref>

According to the report, the IAEA has been able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran, and Iran has provided the Agency with access to declared nuclear material and accountancy reports, as required by its safeguards agreement.

Iran had installed several new centrifuges, including more advanced models, and environmental samples showed the centrifuges "continued to operate as declared", making low-enriched uranium. The report also noted that other elements of Iran's nuclear program continued to be subject to IAEA monitoring and safeguards as well, including the construction of the heavy water facility in Arak, the construction and use of hot cells associated with the Tehran Research Reactor, the uranium conversion efforts, and the Russian nuclear fuel delivered for the Bushehr reactor.

The report stated that the IAEA had requested, as a voluntary "transparency measure", to be allowed access to centrifuge manufacturing sites, but that Iran had refused the request. The IAEA report stated that Iran had also submitted replies to questions regarding "possible military dimensions" to its nuclear program, which include "alleged studies" on a so-called [[Green Salt Project]], high-explosive testing and missile re-entry vehicles. According to the report, Iran's answers were still under review by the IAEA at the time the report was published. However, as part of its earlier "overall assessment" of the allegations, Iran had responded that the documents making the allegations were forged, not authentic, or referred to conventional applications.

The report stated that Iran may have more information on the alleged studies, which "remain a matter of serious concern", but that the IAEA itself had not detected evidence of actual design or manufacture by Iran of nuclear weapons or components. The IAEA also stated that it was not itself in possession of certain documents containing the allegations against Iran, and so was not able to share the documents with Iran.

======September 2008 report======
According to 15 September 2008 IAEA report on the implementation of safeguards in Iran,<ref name=0908Rep >[http://www.isis-online.org/publications/iran/IAEA_Iran_Report_15September2008.pdf ''ISIS'': Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement and relevant provisions of Security Council resolutions 1737 (2006), 1747 (2007) and 1803 (2008) in the Islamic Republic of Iran] 15 September 2008</ref> Iran continued to provide the IAEA with access to declared nuclear material and activities, which continued to be operated under safeguards and with no evidence of any diversion of nuclear material for non-peaceful uses. Nevertheless, the report reiterated that the IAEA would not be able to verify the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program unless Iran adopted "transparency measures" which exceeded its safeguards agreement with the IAEA, since the IAEA does not verify the absence of undeclared nuclear activities in any country unless the Additional Protocol is in force.

With respect to the report, IAEA Director Mohammad ElBaradei stated that, "We have managed to clarify all the remaining outstanding issues, including the most important issue, which is the scope and nature of Iran's enrichment programme" with the exception of a single issue, "and that is the alleged weaponization studies that supposedly Iran has conducted in the past."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2008/iranreport0208.html |title=Latest Iran Safeguards Report Circulated to IAEA Board, Staff Report, February&nbsp;22, 2008 |publisher=Iaea.org |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref>

According to the report, Iran had increased the number of operating centrifuges at its Fuel Enrichment Plant in Isfahan, and continued to enrich uranium. Contrary to some media reports which claimed that Iran had diverted [[uranium hexafluoride]] (UF<sub>6</sub>) for a renewed nuclear weapons program,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/2800255/Iran-renews-nuclear-weapons-development.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912093840/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/2800255/Iran-renews-nuclear-weapons-development.html|archive-date=12 September 2008|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=12 September 2008|newspaper=The Telegraph|title=Iran renews nuclear weapons development}}</ref> the IAEA emphasized that all of the [[uranium hexafluoride]] was under IAEA safeguards. This was re-iterated by IAEA spokesman Melissa Fleming, who characterized the report of missing nuclear material in Iran as being "fictitious."{{cn|date=November 2020}} Iran was also asked to clarify information about foreign assistance it may have received in connection with a high explosive charge suitable for an implosion type nuclear device. Iran stated that there had been no such activities in Iran.<ref name=0908Rep />

The IAEA also reported that it had held a series of meetings with Iranian officials to resolve the outstanding issues including the "alleged studies" into nuclear weaponization which were listed in the May 2008 IAEA report. During the course of these meetings, the Iranians filed a series of written responses including a 117-page presentation which confirmed the partial veracity of some of the allegations, but which asserted that the allegations as a whole were based on "forged" documents and "fabricated" data, and that Iran had not actually received the documentation substantiating the allegations. According to the August 2007 "Modalities Agreement" between Iran and the IAEA, Iran had agreed to review and assess the "alleged studies" claims, as good faith gesture, "upon receiving all related documents."<ref>[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/2007/infcirc711.pdf Understandings of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the IAEA on the Modalities of Resolution of the Outstanding Issues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510230820/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/2007/infcirc711.pdf |date=10 May 2012 }} INFCIRC/711, 27 August 2007</ref>

Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, [[Ali Asghar Soltaniyeh]], accused the United States of preventing the IAEA from delivering the documents about the alleged studies to Iran as required by the Modalities Agreement, and stated that Iran had done its best to respond to the allegations but would not accept "any request beyond our legal obligation and particularly beyond the Work Plan, which we have already implemented."{{cn|date=November 2020}}

While once again expressing "regret" that the IAEA was not able to provide Iran with copies of the documentation concerning the alleged studies, the report also urged Iran to provide the IAEA with "substantive information to support its statements and provide access to relevant documentation and individuals" regarding the alleged studies, as a "matter of transparency".<ref name=0908Rep /> The IAEA submitted a number of proposals to Iran to help resolve the allegations and expressed a willingness to discuss modalities that could enable Iran to demonstrate credibly that the activities referred to in the documentation were not nuclear-related, as Iran asserted, while protecting sensitive information related to its conventional military activities. The report does not indicate whether Iran accepted or rejected these proposals.<ref name=0908Rep />

The report also reiterated that IAEA inspectors had found "no evidence on the actual design or manufacture by Iran of nuclear material components of a nuclear weapon or of certain other key components, such as initiators, or on related nuclear physics studies&nbsp;... Nor has the Agency detected the actual use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies" but insisted that the IAEA would not be able to formally verify the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program unless Iran had agreed to adopt the requested "transparency measures."<ref name=0908Rep />

======February 2009 report======
In a 19 February 2009, report to the Board of Governors,<ref name=GOV20098 >{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2009/gov2009-8.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – gov2009-8.doc |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> IAEA Director General ElBaradei reported that Iran continued to enrich uranium contrary to the decisions of the Security Council and had produced over a ton of low enriched uranium. Results of environmental samples taken by the Agency at the FEP and PFEP5 indicated that the plants have been operating at levels declared by Tehran, "within the measurement uncertainties normally associated with enrichment plants of a similar throughput." The Agency was also able to confirm there was no ongoing reprocessing related activities at Iran's Tehran Research Reactor and Xenon Radioisotope Production Facility.

According to the report, Iran also continued to refuse to provide design information or access to verify design information for its IR-40 heavy water research reactor. Iran and the IAEA in February 2003 agreed to modify a provision in the Subsidiary Arrangement to its safeguards agreement (Code 3.1) to require such access.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/gov2003-40.pdf |id=GOV/2003/40 |title=Implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran |website=iaea.org |accessdate=24 March 2017 |at=paragraph 6}}</ref> Iran told the Agency in March 2007 that it "suspended" the implementation of the modified Code 3.1, which had been "accepted in 2003, but not yet ratified by the parliament", and that it would "revert" to the implementation of the 1976 version of Code 3.1.<ref name="GOV/2008/22">[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2007/gov2007-22.pdf GOV/2007/22] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026213523/http://geocities.com/csafdari/ |date=26 October 2009 }} Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement and Relevant Provisions of Security Council Resolutions in the Islamic Republic of Iran, 27 May 2007, paragraphs 12–14.</ref> The subsidiary arrangement may only be modified by mutual agreement.<ref>[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc214.pdf INFCIRC/214] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060104011741/http%3A//www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/Others/infcirc214.pdf |date=4 January 2006 }}, Iran's NPT safeguards agreement, see paragraph 39</ref> Iran says that since the reactor is not in a position to receive nuclear material the IAEA's request for access was not justified, and requested that the IAEA not schedule an inspection to verify design information.<ref name=GOV20098 /> The Agency says its right to verify design information provided to it is a "continuing right, which is not dependent on the stage of construction of, or the presence of nuclear material at, a facility."<ref name="GOV/2008/22" />

Regarding the "alleged studies" into nuclear weaponization, the Agency said that "as a result of the continued lack of cooperation by Iran in connection with the remaining issues which give rise to concerns about possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear programme, the Agency has not made any substantive progress on these issues." The Agency called on member states which had provided information about the alleged programs to allow the information to be shared with Iran. The Agency said Iran's continued refusal to implement the Additional Protocol was contrary to the request of the Board of Governors and the Security Council.

In a February 2009 press interview, IAEA Director Mohamed ElBaradei said Iran has low enriched uranium, but "that doesn't mean that they are going tomorrow to have nuclear weapons, because as long as they are under IAEA verification, as long as they are not weaponizing, you know." ElBaradei continued that there is a confidence deficit with Iran, but that the concern should not be hyped and that "many other countries are enriching uranium without the world making any fuss about it."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0902/01/fzgps.01.html |title=Fareed Zakaria GPS Transcript |publisher=CNN |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref>

======August 2012 report======
In late August, the IAEA set up an Iran Task Force to deal with inspections and other issues related to Iran's nuclear program, in an attempt to focus and streamline the IAEA's handling of Iran's nuclear program by concentrating experts and other resources into one dedicated team.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jahn|first=George|title=IAEA establishes Iran Task Force|url=http://www.boston.com/business/news/2012/08/29/iaea-establishes-iran-task-force/zZx1ZjGvMTBsqM3Ht3Q8VL/story.html|accessdate=30 August 2012|newspaper=AP|date=29 August 2012}}</ref>

On 30 August, the IAEA released a report showing a major expansion of Iranian enrichment activities.  The report said that Iran has more than doubled the number of centrifuges at the underground facility at Fordow, from 1,064 centrifuges in May to 2,140 centrifuges in August,  though the number of operating centrifuges had not increased.  The report said that since 2010 Iran had produced about 190&nbsp;kg of 20-per-cent-enriched uranium, up from 145&nbsp;kg in May. The report also noted that Iran had converted some of the 20-per-cent-enriched uranium to an oxide form and fabricated into fuel for use in research reactors, and that once this conversion and fabrication have taken place, the fuel cannot be readily enriched to weapon-grade purity.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/un-iran-speeding-up-uranium-production-at-underground-plant/2012/08/30/d08bd4a6-f2c5-11e1-892d-bc92fee603a7_print.html| title=U.N.: Iran speeding up uranium enrichment at underground plant |author=Joby Warrick |newspaper=Washington Post |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=31 August 2012| author-link=Joby Warrick }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ISIS Analysis of IAEA Iran Safeguards Report|url=http://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/ISIS_Analysis_IAEA_Report_30Aug2012.pdf|publisher=Institute for Science and International Security|accessdate=2 September 2012|date=30 August 2012}}</ref>

The report also expressed concerns over [[Parchin]], which the IAEA has sought to inspect for evidence of nuclear weapons development.  Since the IAEA requested access, "significant ground scraping and landscaping have been undertaken over an extensive area at and around the location," five buildings had been demolished, while power lines, fences, and paved roads were removed, all of which would hamper the IAEA investigation if it were granted access.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jpost.com/IranianThreat/News/Article.aspx?id=283278 | title=IAEA: Iran doubles nuclear capacity in 'major expansion' | newspaper=Reuters | author=Keinon, Herb| date=30 August 2012 | accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref>

In a briefing to the Board of Governors on this report in early September 2012, IAEA Deputy Director General Herman Nackaerts and Assistant Director General Rafael Grossi displayed satellite images for its member states which allegedly demonstrate Iranian efforts to remove incriminating evidence from its facility at Parchin, or a "nuclear clean-up."  These images showed a building at Parchin covered in what appeared to be a pink tarpaulin, as well as demolition of building and removal of earth that the IAEA said would "significantly hamper" its investigation.  A senior Western diplomat described the presentation as "pretty compelling."  The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) said that the purpose of the pink tarpaulin could be to hide further "clean-up work" from satellites.  However, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran's envoy to the IAEA, denied the contents of the presentation, saying that "merely having a photo from up there, a satellite imagery ... this is not the way the agency should do its professional job."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/05/us-nuclear-iran-iaea-idUSBRE8841FK20120905 | title=IAEA shows diplomats images of suspected Iran nuclear clean-up | work=Reuters | date=5 September 2012 | accessdate=10 September 2012 | author=Dahl, Frederick}}</ref>

According to the Associated Press, the IAEA received "new and significant intelligence" by September 2012, which four diplomats confirmed was the basis for a passage in the August 2012 IAEA report that "the agency has obtained more information which further corroborates" suspicions.  The intelligence reportedly indicates that Iran had advanced work on computer modeling of the performance of a nuclear warhead, work David Albright of [[Institute for Science and International Security|ISIS]] said was "critical to the development of a nuclear weapon."  The intelligence would also boost fears by the IAEA that Iran has advanced its weapons research on multiple fronts, as computer modeling is usually accompanied by physical tests of the components which would enter a nuclear weapon.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/11/iran-nuclear-weapon-capab_n_1873365.html?| title=IAEA Iran Nuclear Weapon Capabilities Closer: Report | newspaper = Associated Press | date=11 September 2012 | accessdate=11 September 2012 | author=Jahn, George}}</ref>

In response to this report, the IAEA Board of Governors on 13 September passed a resolution that rebuked Iran for defying UN Security Council resolutions to suspend uranium enrichment and called on Iran to allow inspections of evidence that it is pursuing weapons technology.<ref>{{cite web|title=Implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement and relevant provisions of United Nations Security Council resolutions in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Resolution adopted by the Board of Governors on 13 September 2012|url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/gov2012-50.pdf|publisher=IAEA|accessdate=8 October 2017|date=13 September 2012}}</ref>  The resolution, which passed by a vote of 31–1 with 3 abstentions, also expressed "serious concerns" about Iran's nuclear program while desiring a peaceful resolution.  Senior United States diplomat Robert Wood blamed Iran for "systematically demolishing" a facility at the Parchin military base, which IAEA inspectors have attempted to visit in the past, but were not granted access, saying "Iran has been taking measures that appear consistent with an effort to remove evidence of its past activities at Parchin."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jpost.com/IranianThreat/News/Article.aspx?id=285023 | title=United Nations nuclear agency board rebukes Iran | work=Reuters | date=13 September 2012 | accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref>  The resolution was introduced jointly by China, France, Germany, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/09/12/uk-nuclear-iran-iaea-idUKBRE88B0FU20120912| title=Russia, China join West in Iran rebuke at U.N. nuclear meet | work=Reuters | date= 13 September 2012 | accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref>

======February 2013 report======
On 21 February, the IAEA released a report showing continued expansion in Iranian uranium enrichment capabilities. As of 19 February, 12,699 IR-1 centrifuges have been installed at Natanz. This includes the installation of 2,255 centrifuges since the previous IAEA report in November.<ref name="iaea.org">[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2012/gov2012-55.pdf "Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement and relevant provisions of Security Council resolutions in the Islamic Republic of Iran"], 16 November 2012, IAEA Board of Governors</ref>

Fordow, the nuclear facility near Qom, contains 16 cascades, equally divided between Unit 1 and Unit 2, with a total of 2,710 centrifuges. Iran is continuing to operate the four cascades of 174 IR-1 centrifuges each in two tandem sets to produce 19.75 per cent LEU in a total of 696 enriching centrifuges, the same number of centrifuges enriching as was reported in November 2012.<ref name="isis-online.org">{{cite web|title=ISIS Analysis of IAEA Iran Safeguards Report|url=http://www.isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/ISIS_Analysis_IAEA_safeguards_Report_21Feb2013.pdf|publisher=Institute for Science and International Security|accessdate=21 February 2013|date=21 February 2013}}</ref>

Iran has produced approximately 280&nbsp;kg of near-20 per cent enriched uranium, an increase of 47&nbsp;kg since the November 2012 IAEA report and the total 3.5 per cent LEU production stands at 8,271&nbsp;kg (compared to 7,611&nbsp;kg reported during the last quarter).<ref name="iaea.org"/>

The IAEA February 2013 report stated that Iran has resumed reconverting near-20 per cent enriched uranium into Oxide form to fabricate fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor, which makes it more difficult to further enrich that uranium to [[weapons grade]], since it would first need to be converted back to uranium hexafluoride gas.<ref name="IAEA GOV/2013/6">{{cite web|title=Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement and relevant provisions of Security Council resolutions in the Islamic Republic of Iran|url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/gov2013-6.pdf|publisher= International Atomic Energy Agency|date=21 February 2013|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>

The February report noted that Iran has continued to deny the IAEA access to the military site at [[Parchin]].  Citing evidence from satellite imagery that "Iran constructed a large explosives containment vessel in which to conduct hydrodynamic experiments". Such installation could be an indicator of nuclear weapons development. The report expresses concern that changes taking place at the Parchin military site might eliminate evidence of past nuclear activities, noting that there had been virtually no activity at that location between February 2005 and the time the IAEA requested access.  Those changes include:
* Reinstatement of some of the chamber building's features, for example wall panels and exhaust piping.
* Alterations to the roofs of the chamber building and the other large building.
* Dismantlement and reconstruction of the annex to the other large building.
* Construction of one small building at the same place where a building of similar size had previously been demolished.
* Spreading, levelling and compacting of another layer of material over a large area.
* Installation of a fence that divides the location into two areas. Most of these activities have also been documented by ISIS in satellite imagery reports, dated 29 November 2012, 12 December 2012 and 25 January 2013.<ref name="isis-online.org"/><ref name="IAEA GOV/2013/6"/>

Iran said that the IR-40 heavy water-moderated research reactor at Arak was expected begin to operate in the first quarter of 2014.  During on-site inspections of the IR-40 design, IAEA inspectors observed that the previously reported installation of cooling and moderator circuit piping was almost complete. The IAEA reports that Iran will use the TRR to test fuel for the IR-40 reactor, a reactor that the UN Security Council has demanded that Iran stop building because it could be used to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. The IAEA report states that "on 26 November 2012, the Agency verified a prototype IR-40 natural uranium fuel assembly before its transfer to TRR for irradiation testing."<ref name="IAEA GOV/2013/6"/> Since its last visit on 17 August 2011, the Agency has not been provided with further access to the plant so is relying on satellite imagery to monitor the status of the plant.<ref name="IAEA GOV/2013/6"/>

======March 2015 report======
In March 2015, IAEA Director General Amano reported that Iran did not provide sufficient access or information to resolve a dozen issues related to the possible military dimensions of its nuclear program, giving only very limited information on only one of those issues.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mufson |first=Steven |title=Iran isn't providing needed access or information, nuclear watchdog says |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/un-nuclear-watchdog-iran-not-providing-needed-information-access/2015/03/24/6557b24a-d23d-11e4-8fce-3941fc548f1c_story.html |newspaper=Washington Post |date=24 March 2015 |access-date=3 April 2015 }}</ref>

======December 2015 report======
In December 2015, the IAEA issued a report concluding:<ref>{{cite web|title=Final Assessment on Past and Present Outstanding Issues regarding Iran's Nuclear Programme|url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/gov-2015-68.pdf|publisher=IAEA|date=2 December 2015}}</ref>
<blockquote>The Agency  assesses  that  a  range  of  activities  relevant  to  the  development  of  a  nuclear explosive  device  were conducted  in  Iran  prior  to  the  end  of  2003  as  a  coordinated  effort,  and  some activities took place after 2003. The Agency also assesses that these activities did not advance beyond feasibility  and  scientific  studies,  and the acquisition  of  certain  relevant technical  competences and capabilities. The Agency has no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009.</blockquote>

Following this report, the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution closing its consideration of the issues in the report and terminating previous resolutions about Iran.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action implementation and verification and monitoring in the Islamic Republic of Iran in light of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015)|url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/gov-2015-72-derestricted.pdf|publisher=IAEA|date=15 December 2015}}</ref>

In explaining why it had left its enrichment program undeclared to the IAEA, Iran said that for the past twenty-four years it has "been subject to the most severe series of sanctions and export restrictions on material and technology for peaceful nuclear technology," so that some elements of its program had to be done discreetly. Iran said the US intention "is nothing but to make this deprivation" of Iran's inalienable right to enrichment technology "final and eternal," and that the United States is completely silent on Israel's nuclear enrichment and weapons program.<ref name=IC657 /> Iran began its nuclear research as early as 1975, when France cooperated with Iran to set up the Esfahan Nuclear Technology Center (ENTC) to provide training for personnel to develop certain nuclear fuel cycle capabilities.<ref>{{cite document|title=Energy Citations Database (ECD) – Document No. 7095626|year=2008|osti=7095626}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Esfahan / Isfahan – Iran Special Weapons Facilities|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iran/esfahan.htm|accessdate=24 February 2008|year=2008}}</ref> Iran did not hide other elements of its nuclear program.

"They should know that the Iranian nation will not yield to pressure and will not let its rights be trampled on," Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] told a crowd 31 August 2006, in a televised speech in the northwestern Iranian city of [[Orumiyeh]]. In front of his strongest supporters in one of his provincial power bases, the Iranian leader attacked what he called "intimidation" by the United Nations, which he said was led by the United States. Ahmadinejad criticised a White House rebuff of his offer for a televised debate with President Bush. "They say they support dialog and the free flow of information," he said. "But when debate was proposed, they avoided and opposed it." Ahmadinejad said that sanctions "cannot dissuade Iranians from their decision to make progress," according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency. "On the contrary, many of our successes, including access to the nuclear fuel cycle and producing of heavy water, have been achieved under sanctions."

Iran insists enrichment activities are intended for peaceful purposes, but much of the West, including the United States, allege that Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons, or a nuclear weapons "capability". 31 August 2006, deadline called for Iran to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1696 and suspend its enrichment-related activities or face the possibility of economic sanctions. The United States believes the council will agree to implement sanctions when high-level ministers reconvene in mid-September, US Undersecretary of State [[R. Nicholas Burns|Nicholas Burns]] said. "We're sure going to work toward that [sanctions] with a great deal of energy and determination because this cannot go unanswered," Burns said. "The Iranians are obviously proceeding with their nuclear research; they are doing things that the International Atomic Energy Agency does not want them to do, the Security Council doesn't want them to do. There has to be an international answer, and we believe there will be one."<ref name="CNN-08-31" />

Iran asserts that there is no legal basis for Iran's referral to the United Nations Security Council since the IAEA has not proven that previously undeclared activities had a relationship to a weapons program, and that all nuclear material in Iran (including material that may not have been declared) had been accounted for and had not been diverted to military purposes.

Iran also minimizes the significance of the IAEA's inability to verify the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program, arguing the IAEA has only drawn such conclusions in a subset of states that have ratified and implemented the Additional Protocol.

Iran agreed to implement the Additional Protocol under the terms of the October 2003 Tehran agreement and its successor, the November 2004 Paris agreement, and did so for two years before withdrawing from the Paris agreement in early 2006 following the breakdown of negotiations with the EU-3. Since then, Iran has offered not only to ratify the Additional Protocol, but to implement transparency measures on its nuclear program that exceed the Additional Protocol, as long as its right to operate an enrichment program is recognized. The UN Security Council, however, insists that Iran must suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, and the United States explicitly ruled out the possibility that it would allow Iran to produce its own nuclear fuel, even under intense international inspection.<ref name="sanger1" >{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/us/politics/27clinton.html |title=Clinton Says Nuclear Aim of Iran Is Fruitless|author=David Sanger|work=New York Times|date=26 July 2009}}</ref>

The negotiations between [[Ahmadinejad's government]] and the P5+1 group did not end the dispute due to Iran's firm stance on not suspending uranium enrichment. At the same time, the top clerics in Tehran felt Ahmadinejad's firm standing against the West would destabilize their regime. Ahmadinejad had some tendency toward Iranian nationalism, which deviated from the clerics' theocratic rule. Hence they labeled the faction associated with him as "[[deviant current]]". When Ahmadinejad became a lame duck president in the last year of his second term (2012–2013), the clerics bypassed him and the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|Majles]], and tried to negotiate secretly with the U.S. officials. They sent a separate team to Muscat to negotiate a nuclear deal through a back channel with the White House.

A congressional report released on 23 August 2006, summarized the documentary history of Iran's nuclear program, but also made allegations against the IAEA. The IAEA responded with a strongly worded letter to then US House Intelligence Committee Chairman [[Peter Hoekstra]], which labeled as "outrageous and dishonest" the report's allegation that an IAEA inspector was dismissed for violating a supposed IAEA policy against "telling the whole truth" about Iran and pointed out other factual errors, such as a claim that Iran had enriched "weapons-grade" uranium.<ref>{{cite news|title=US Iran report branded dishonest|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/5346524.stm|accessdate=24 February 2008|date=14 September 2006|work=BBC News}}</ref>

[[John R.

Bolton said that when the deadline passes "a little flag will go up." "In terms of what happens afterward, at that point, if they have not suspended all uranium enrichment activities, they will not be in compliance with the resolution," he said. "And at that point, the steps that the foreign ministers have agreed upon previously&nbsp;... we would begin to talk about how to implement those steps." The five permanent members of the Security Council, plus Germany, previously offered Iran a package of incentives aimed at getting the country to restart negotiations, but Iran refused to halt its nuclear activities first. Incentives included offers to improve Iran's access to the international economy through participation in groups such as the [[World Trade Organization]] and to modernize its telecommunications industry. The incentives also mentioned the possibility of lifting restrictions on US and European manufacturers wanting to export civil aircraft to Iran.

The impending opening of the [[Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant|Bushehr I]] plant in late 2010 prompted the [[White House]] to question why Iran is continuing to enrich uranium within its borders. "Russia is providing the fuel, and taking the fuel back out," White House spokesman [[Robert Gibbs]] said in August. "It, quite clearly, I think, underscores that Iran does not need its own enrichment capability if its intentions, as it states, are for a peaceful nuclear program," he said.<ref name="CNN.com"/>

Therefore, the report recommended that the United States should increase sanctions on Iran in order to curb its ability to develop weapon-grade uranium.

Iran has held a series of meetings with a group of six countries: China, France, Germany, Russia, United Kingdom, United States.  These six are known as the P5+1 (the permanent five members of the UN Security Council plus Germany) or alternatively as the E3+3.  These meetings are intended to resolve concerns about Iran's nuclear program.

Also in October, the United States, France and Russia proposed a UN-drafted deal to Iran regarding its nuclear program, in an effort to find a compromise between Iran's stated need for a nuclear reactor and international concerns that Iran harbors a secret intent on developing a nuclear weapon.

In November 2009, the IAEA Board of Governors passed a resolution that criticized Iran for defying a UN Security Council ban on uranium enrichment, censured Iran for secretly building a uranium enrichment facility and demanded that it immediately suspend further construction.

The continuing controversy over Iran's nuclear program revolves in part around allegations of nuclear studies by Iran with possible military applications until 2003, when, according to the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, the program was ended. The allegations, which include claims that Iran had engaged in high-explosives testing, sought to manufacture "green salt" ({{chem|UF|4}}) and to design a nuclear-capable missile warhead, were based on information obtained from a laptop computer which was allegedly retrieved from Iran in 2004.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/07/AR2006020702126_pf.html |title=Strong Leads and Dead Ends in Nuclear Case Against Iran |first=Dafna |last=Linzer |work=Washington Post |date=8 February 2006 |accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref> The US presented some of the alleged contents of the laptop in 2005 to an audience of international diplomats, though the laptop and the full documents contained in it have yet to be given to the IAEA for independent verification. According to the ''New York Times'':

{{bquote|Nonetheless, doubts about the intelligence persist among some foreign analysts. In part, that is because American officials, citing the need to protect their source, have largely refused to provide details of the origins of the laptop computer beyond saying that they obtained it in mid-2004 from a longtime contact in Iran. Moreover, this chapter in the confrontation with Iran is infused with the memory of the faulty intelligence on Iraq's unconventional arms. In this atmosphere, though few countries are willing to believe Iran's denials about nuclear arms, few are willing to accept the United States' weapons intelligence without question. "I can fabricate that data," a senior European diplomat said of the documents. "It looks beautiful, but is open to doubt.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/international/middleeast/13nukes.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Laptop: Relying on Computer, U.S. Seeks to Prove Iran's Nuclear Aims |first1=William J. |last1=Broad |first2=David E. |last2=Sanger |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 November 2005 |accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref>}}

On 21 August 2007, Iran and the IAEA finalized an agreement, titled "Understandings of The Islamic Republic of Iran and the IAEA on the Modalities of Resolution of the Outstanding Issues," that listed outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear program and set out a timetable to resolve each issue in order. These unresolved issues included the status of Iran's uranium mine at Gchine, allegations of experiments with plutonium and uranium metal, and the use of Polonium 210.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/2007/infcirc711.pdf |title=INFCIRC/711 Date: 27 August 2007 |accessdate=4 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510230820/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Infcircs/2007/infcirc711.pdf |archive-date=10 May 2012  }}</ref> Specifically regarding the "Alleged Studies", the Modalities agreement asserted that while Iran considers the documents to be fabricated, Iran would nevertheless address the allegations "upon receiving all related documents" as a goodwill gesture. The Modalities Agreement specifically said that aside from the issues identified in the document, there were "no other remaining issues and ambiguities regarding Iran's past nuclear program and activities."

The United States was opposed to the Modalities Agreement between Iran and the IAEA, and vehemently objected to it, accusing Iran of "manipulating" IAEA.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  Olli Heinonen, the IAEA Deputy Director General for safeguards underlined the importance of the Iran-IAEA agreement as a working arrangement on how to resolve the outstanding issues that triggered Security Council resolutions:

{{bquote|All these measures which you see there for resolving our outstanding issues go beyond the requirements of the Additional Protocol&nbsp;...

Following the implementation of the Modalities Agreement, the IAEA issued another report on the status of Iran's nuclear program on 22 February 2008. According to this report, the IAEA had no evidence of a current, undeclared nuclear program in Iran, and all of the remaining issues listed in the Modalities Agreement regarding past undeclared nuclear activities had been resolved, with the exception of the "Alleged Studies" issue. Regarding this report, IAEA director ElBaradei specifically stated:

{{bquote|[W]e have made quite good progress in clarifying the outstanding issues that had to do with Iran's past nuclear activities, with the exception of one issue, and that is the alleged weaponization studies that supposedly Iran has conducted in the past.

The US had made some of the "Alleged Studies" documentation available to the IAEA just a week prior to the issuance of the IAEA's February 2008 report on Iran's nuclear program. According to the IAEA report itself, the IAEA had "not detected the use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies, nor does it have credible information in this regard." Some diplomats reportedly dismissed the new allegations as being "of doubtful value&nbsp;... relatively insignificant and coming too late."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.wsvn.com/news/articles/world/MI77582/ |title=Diplomats say US again shares information on Iran's nuclear program, Associated Press, Thursday, 21 February 2008 |publisher=.wsvn.com |accessdate=4 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307004933/http://www1.wsvn.com/news/articles/world/MI77582/ |archive-date=7 March 2012  }}</ref>

It was reported on 3 March 2008, that Olli Heinonen, the IAEA Deputy Director general of safeguards, had briefed diplomats about the contents of the "Alleged Studies" documents a week earlier. Reportedly, Heinonen added that the IAEA had obtained corroborating information from the intelligence agencies of several countries, that pointed to sophisticated research into some key technologies needed to build and deliver a nuclear bomb.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/01/AR2008030101722.html|work=The Washington Post|title=UN Says Iran May Not Have Come Clean on Nuclear Past|first1=Joby|last1=Warrick|first2=Colum|last2=Lynch|date=2 March 2008|accessdate=9 April 2010}}</ref>

In April 2008, Iran reportedly agreed to address the sole outstanding issue of the "Alleged Studies"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/24/world/middleeast/24iran.html |title=Iran to Discuss Alleged Studies of Atomic Arms|work=Reuters|date=24 April 2008}}</ref> However, according to the subsequent May 2008 IAEA report, the IAEA was not able to actually provide these same "Alleged Studies" documents to Iran, because the IAEA did not have the documents itself or was not allowed to share them with Iran. For example, in paragraph 21, the IAEA report states: "Although the Agency had been shown the documents that led it to these conclusions, it was not in possession of the documents and was therefore unfortunately unable to make them available to Iran." Also, in paragraph 16, the IAEA report states: "The Agency received much of this information only in electronic form and was not authorised to provide copies to Iran." The IAEA has requested that it be allowed to share the documents with Iran. Nevertheless, according to the report, Iran may have more information on the alleged studies which "remain a matter of serious concern" but the IAEA itself had not detected evidence of actual design or manufacture by Iran of nuclear weapons or components.

Iran's refusal to respond to the IAEA's questions unless it is given access to the original documents has caused a standoff. In February 2008, ''The New York Times'' reported that the US refusal to provide access to those documents was a source of friction between the Bush Administration and then Director General ElBaradei.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/world/middleeast/15iran.html?pagewanted=print "U.S. to Produce Data on Iran's Nuclear Program", ''New York Times'', By David E.

The IAEA has requested that third parties{{vague|date=November 2011}} allow it to share the documents on the alleged studies with Iran. The IAEA has further stated that though it has not provided full documents containing the alleged studies, information from other countries has corroborated some of the allegations, which appear to the IAEA to be consistent and credible, and that Iran should therefore address the alleged studies even without obtaining the full documents. However, questions about the authenticity of the documents persist, with claims that the documents were obtained either from Israel or the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]], an Iranian dissident group based on Islamic and Socialist ideology officially considered to be a [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist organization]] by the United States, and that investigations into the alleged studies are intended to reveal intelligence about Iran's conventional weapons programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/KI22Ak01.html |title=Iran and IAEA re-enter missile row By Gareth Porter, Asia Times, 22 September 2009 |publisher=Atimes.com |date=22 September 2009 |accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41416 |title=POLITICS: Iran Nuke Laptop Data Came from Terror Group, By Gareth Porter, IPS News, 29 February 2008 |publisher=Ipsnews.net |accessdate=4 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313112002/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41416 |archive-date=13 March 2012  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Julian Borger in Vienna |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/22/iran.usa |title=US Iran intelligence 'is incorrect', by Julian Borger, The Guardian, Thursday 22 February 2007 |newspaper=Guardian |date= 22 February 2007|accessdate=4 April 2012 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiwar.com/orig/sahimi.php?articleid=13559 |title=Iran, the IAEA, and the Laptop: Where is the digital chain of custody? by Muhammad Sahimi, Antiwar.com, 7 October 2008 |publisher=Antiwar.com |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref> Some IAEA officials have requested a clear statement be made by the agency that it could not affirm the documents' authenticity.

===Iranian statements on nuclear deterrence===
The Iranian authorities deny seeking a nuclear weapons capacity for deterrence or retaliation since Iran's level of technological progress cannot match that of existing nuclear weapons states, and the acquisition of nuclear weapons would only spark an arms race in the Middle East. According to Ambassador Javad Zarif:

{{bquote|It is true that Iran has neighbors with abundant nuclear weapons, but this does not mean that Iran must follow suit. In fact, the predominant view among Iranian decision-makers is that development, acquisition or possession of nuclear weapons would only undermine Iranian security. Viable security for Iran can be attained only through inclusion and regional and global engagement.<ref>[http://www.un.int/iran/pressaffairs/pressreleases/1997/articles/1.html An Unnecessary Crisis: Setting the Record Straight about Iran's Nuclear Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924034649/http://www.un.int/iran/pressaffairs/pressreleases/1997/articles/1.html |date=24 September 2008 }} by Amb. Zarif, Published in New York Times (18 November 2005)</ref> }}

Iran's President Ahmadinejad, during an interview with NBC anchor Brian Williams in July 2008, also dismissed the utility of nuclear weapons as a source of security and stated:

{{bquote|Again, did nuclear arms help the Soviet Union from falling and disintegrating? For that matter, did a nuclear bomb help the U.S. to prevail inside Iraq or Afghanistan, for that matter? Nuclear bombs belong to the 20th century. We are living in a new century&nbsp;... Nuclear energy must not be equaled to a nuclear bomb. This is a disservice to the society of man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25887437 |title=Transcript: 'Response&nbsp;... will be a positive one' – Nightly News with Brian Williams – NBC News |publisher=NBC News |date=28 July 2008 |accessdate=26 October 2008}}</ref>}}

According to Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization:

{{bquote|In matters of national security we are not timid. We will assert our intentions. If nuclear weapons would have brought security, we would have announced to the world that we would go after them&nbsp;... We do not think a nuclear Iran would be stronger&nbsp;... If we have weapons of mass destruction we are not going to use them – we cannot. We did not use chemical weapons against Iraq. Secondly, we do not feel any real threat from our neighbours. Pakistan and the Persian Gulf, we have no particular problems with them, nor with Afghanistan. The only powerful country is Russia in the north, and no matter how many nuclear weapons we had we could not match Russia. Israel, our next neighbour, we do not consider an entity by itself but as part of the US. Facing Israel means facing the US. We cannot match the US. We do not have strategic differences with our neighbours, including Turkey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranaffairs.com/iran_affairs/2009/07/irans-nuclear-programme-is-peaceful--september-9-2004-----the-board-of-the-international-atomic-energy-agency-iaea.html |archive-date=28 July 2009 |archive-url=https://swap.stanford.edu/20090728161611/http://www.iranaffairs.com/iran_affairs/2009/07/irans%2Dnuclear%2Dprogramme%2Dis%2Dpeaceful%2D%2Dseptember%2D9%2D2004%2D%2D%2D%2D%2Dthe%2Dboard%2Dof%2Dthe%2Dinternational%2Datomic%2Denergy%2Dagency%2Diaea.html |url-status=dead|title=Iran's nuclear program is peaceful-Financial Times, 9 September 2004, by Gareth Smyth |publisher=Iranaffairs.com |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=4 April 2012 }}</ref>}}

===Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in the Middle East===
{{main|Middle East nuclear weapon free zone}}

Historically, until its own nuclear program began development, Iran had consistently supported the creation of a nuclear-weapons free zone in the Middle East. In 1974, as concerns in the region grew over Israel's nuclear weapon program, Iran formally proposed the concept of a nuclear weapon free zone in the Middle East in a joint resolution in the UN General Assembly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acronym.org.uk/dd/dd86/86nwfzme.htm |title=Disarmament Diplomacy, Issue No. 86, Autumn 2007, Rethinking Security Interests for a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the Middle East, Rebecca Johnson |publisher=Acronym.org.uk |accessdate=20 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308193802/http://acronym.org.uk/dd/dd86/86nwfzme.htm |archive-date=8 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
