== Career with the Humane Society of the United States ==
[[File:Wayne Pacelle at Nicola's Books.JPG|thumb|left|Wayne Pacelle at a book signing event, [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] ]]
Pacelle secured the passage of dozens of federal statutes and amendments to protect animals, including laws to increase penalties for harming law enforcement animals, protect great apes in their native habitats protections for great apes, sharks, and big cats, elevated punishments for animal fighting, mandated accurate labels for fur, and other legal victories. Pacelle has testified before U.S. House and Senate committees on a wide variety of animal protection issues, including farm animal welfare including calls for increased funding for the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] and efforts to ban cockfighting, dogfighting, and other harmful practices.   

Pacelle has been associated with 26 successful statewide ballot initiatives to protect animals, including measures to prohibit cockfighting, prohibit mourning dove hunting, restrict steel traps and certain poisons, and ban certain farming methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hslf.org/ballot-initiatives/ballot_initiative_history.html |title=Ballot Initiatives |publisher=The Humane Society Legislative Fund |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722212341/http://www.hslf.org/ballot-initiatives/ballot_initiative_history.html |archive-date=2011-07-22 |accessdate=2011-04-04 |quote=Between 1990 and 2008, animal advocates squared off against factory farmers, hunters, and other animal industries in 41 statewide ballot campaigns, winning in 28 campaigns and marking a huge surge in the use of the process on animal issues. |url-status=dead}}</ref> He has been vocal in criticizing individuals and groups who he says resort to intimidation, vandalism, or violence.<ref name=Oldenburg/>

Under Pacelle's direction, the HSUS has secured the adoption of "cage-free" egg-purchasing policies by several hundred universities and corporations;<ref>{{cite news |title= Cage-free hens pushed to rule roost |first= Deena |last= Shankar |url= http://fortune.com/2015/04/09/humane-society-food-companies-negotiation/ |magazine= [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |date= 2015-04-09 |accessdate=2016-06-08}}</ref> the phase-out of gestation crates by key pork producers nationwide;<ref>{{cite news | title= Pork Producers Phase Out Use of Sow Stalls |first=Philip |last=Brasher |url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/pork_producers_phase_out_use_of_sow_stalls-219757-1.html |newspaper=[[Roll Call]] |date=2012-12-06 |accessdate=2016-06-08}}</ref> the exposure of an international trophy hunting scam;<ref>{{cite news |title= Congress votes to shut down trophy hunting tax scam |first= Amy |last= Lorentzen |url= http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=016280 |agency= [[Associated Press]] |date= 2006-08-06 |accessdate= 2011-04-11 |quote= The issue came to lawmakers' attention after the Humane Society of the United States conducted a two-year investigation into a scam where they said hunters shot rare animals from around the world, then donated them to phony museums in order to get charitable tax deductions. |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080311091713/http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic%3Bf%3D1%3Bt%3D016280 |archive-date= 2008-03-11 |url-status=dead}}</ref> successful congressional votes and litigation to end horse slaughter; and an agreement from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to begin enforcement of federal laws concerning the transportation of farm animals. 

; Animal cruelty

In early 2008, the HSUS's investigation of animal treatment at the [[Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company]] sparked the largest beef recall in American history and congressional calls for reform of the slaughterhouse inspection system.<ref>{{cite news |title= Congress to investigate food safety process in wake of Chino slaughterhouse scandal |first1= Kimberly |last1= Pierceall |first2= Ben |last2= Goad |url= http://www.pe.com/localnews/inland/stories/PE_News_Local_D_meat20.3c5df3c.html |newspaper= [[The Press-Enterprise (California)|The Press-Enterprise]] |publisher= Ronald R.

; Successes

Two November 2006 ballot initiatives conducted with HSUS's support outlawed dove hunting in Michigan and abusive farming practices in Arizona.  In January, 2007, several months after passage of the Arizona ballot measure, [[Smithfield Foods]], the largest pork producer in the world, announced that it would phase out the use of [[gestation crate]]s that immobilize pregnant sows through confinement.<ref>{{cite news |title= Arizona voters truly made difference |url= https://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/opinions/articles/0131wed2-31.html |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120721143043/http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/opinions/articles/0131wed2-31.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2012-07-21 |newspaper= [[The Arizona Republic]] |publisher= John Zidich |location= [[Phoenix, Arizona]] |date= 2007-01-31 |accessdate= 2011-04-12}}</ref> Maple Leaf Foods, Canada's largest pork producer and the Strauss Veal company<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.humanesociety.org/news/news/2008/12/strauss_veal_crate_free_122408.html |title= Nation's Largest Veal Producer Ends Use of Crates |date=2008-12-24 |publisher= [[Humane Society of the United States|The Humane Society of the United States]] |location= [[Washington, D.C.]] |accessdate= 2011-04-14 }} {{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}</ref> also followed suit.

; Agreement with United Egg Producers

In 2011, Pacelle and Chad Gregory of the [[United Egg Producers]] (UEP) agreed to work together in support of federal hen welfare legislation.

; Agreement with Sea World

In March 2016, Pacelle and [[SeaWorld]] CEO [[Joel Manby]] agreed to cooperate on several issues of mutual concern, and SeaWorld agreed to phase out its use of orca whales in performance, to end breeding of captive orcas, and to implement reforms including the introduction of humanely raised products to menus at SeaWorld's theme parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-cfb-tourism-column-0404-20160401-story.html|title=How SeaWorld, Humane Society united|first=Sandra|last=Pedicini|website=OrlandoSentinel.com|accessdate=February 3, 2018}}</ref>

; Humane Society Legislative Fund

Pacelle is a cofounder of the Humane Society Legislative Fund (HSLF), a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization that lobbies for animal welfare legislation and works to elect humane-minded candidates to public office. He also cofounded Humane USA, a nonpartisan political action committee (PAC) that supports candidates of any political party based on their support for animal protection. These two organizations helped defeat lawmakers in Congress they consider hostile to animals, including Rep. [[Chris John]] of Louisiana, Rep. [[Richard Pombo]] of California, and Senator [[Conrad Burns]] of Montana.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Humane Society Becomes a Political Animal |first=Jeffrey H. |last=Birnbaum |author-link=Jeffrey Birnbaum |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/29/AR2007012901861.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2007-01-30 |accessdate=2011-04-11 |quote=The Humane Society targeted both in last year's elections after [[Robert Ehrlich|Ehrlich]] supported bear hunting and [[Richard Pombo|Pombo]] supported commercial whaling and trapping in wildlife refuges. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026064929/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/29/AR2007012901861.html |archive-date=2012-10-26 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

; Corporate combinations

The HSUS experienced major growth since 2004, primarily as a result of corporate combinations Pacelle forged with The Fund for Animals in 2005 and the [[Doris Day Animal League]] in 2006. During the first 30 months of Pacelle's tenure, overall revenues and expenditures grew by more than 50 percent. HSUS's annual budget for 2006 was $103 million. The organization claims nearly 10 million members and constituents.<ref name="sarasohnWP">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/06/AR2006090601770.html|title=Merger Adds to Humane Society's Bite|last=Sarasohn|first=Judy|date=2006-09-07|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=2011-04-01|quote=One would think that a membership roster of 9.5 million would make a special interest group quite special on Capitol Hill, but the Humane Society of the United States wants more firepower.}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
HSUS has faced criticism from various groups during Pacelle's tenure, including the [[Center for Consumer Freedom]], which receives money from the food industry, and [[Protect the Harvest]], which is funded by oilman [[Forrest Lucas]].

===Pacelle's Resignation===

In 2018, [[Chronicle of Philanthropy]] reported that Pacelle was under investigation for a "sexual relationship with an employee".<ref>https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Humane-Society-CEO-Under/242342</ref> In December 2018 HSUS launched an internal investigation, hiring the law firm [[Morgan, Lewis & Bockius]] to investigate three separate allegations of sexual harassment. Investigators found that the charity had offered settlements to three additional individuals who alleged they were dismissed or demoted after reporting instances of harassment by Pacelle.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/humane-society-ceo-is-subject-of-sexual-harassment-complaints-from-three-women-according-to-internal-investigation/2018/01/29/12c8961e-053b-11e8-94e8-e8b8600ade23_story.html?noredirect=on|title=Humane Society CEO is subject of sexual harassment complaints from three women, according to internal investigation|last=Paquette|first=Danielle|date=January 29, 2018|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=June 10, 2018}}</ref> [[The New York Times]] subsequently reported on an interview with a Humane Society employee who alleges Pacelle sexually assaulted her in his office.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/us/humane-society-ceo-sexual-harassment-.html</ref> Pacelle has denied each allegation.

Donors like the Greenbaum Foundation, which donated nearly $100,000 to the HSUS in 2017, claimed they would likely stop funding the HSUS because of the board’s handling the allegations against Pacelle.

Some defended Pacelle's placement as CEO. The Washington Post's Kathleen Parker offered support in the wake of Pacelle's resignation, claiming that it was not necessarily the best "for the organization he built or the animals it has served..." and thanked Pacelle for his "stewardship, advocacy and legendary work ethic." She added "No person is all one thing, good or bad, and Pacelle is no exception."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-metoo-backlash-is-inevitable/2018/02/02/51d2d626-0860-11e8-b48c-b07fea957bd5_story.html|title=Opinion {{!}} A #MeToo backlash is inevitable|last=Parker|first=Kathleen|date=2018-02-02|work=Washington Post|accessdate=2018-04-19|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Other affiliates of the organization supported Pacelle's resignation, claiming that the HSUS board had put Pacelle's fundraising abilities above concerns for other employees in their evaluation of the evidence against Pacelle.

=== Food and agriculture industries ===
The Center for Consumer Freedom has criticized Pacelle for holding animal-rights views, arguing, "When Wayne Pacelle took over, it ceased being an animal welfare group and suddenly became an animal rights group."<ref name="LA">{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-pacelle19-2008jul19-story.html|title=Wayne Pacelle works for the winged, finned and furry|last=Hall|first=Carla|website=latimes.com|accessdate=2016-12-30}}</ref>
<!-- Need a source to explain why this should be "criticism", and according to whom
Before he joined HSUS, Pacelle made a number of comments against hunting and pets. When asked if he would campaign against hunting for food, Pacelle stated, “I think that I would campaign against it.” When asked about not campaigning against fishing, Pacelle admitted it was because fish were not “furry and cute.” And when asked if he envisioned a future without pets, he replied, “I wouldn’t say that I envision that, no. If I had my personal view perhaps that might take hold. In fact, I don’t want to see another cat or dog born. It’s not something I strive for, though.”<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bloodties: Nature, Culture, and the Hunt|last=Kerasote|first=Ted|year=1994}}</ref> -->
Under Pacelle, HSUS created state agriculture advisory councils. Members of the agriculture councils have criticized the direction of HSUS, arguing that the agriculture councils' influence has waned while more radical elements of HSUS have gained influence. One Nebraska rancher and spokesperson for the agriculture councils claimed that Pacelle allowed HSUS to become a "good ol' boys vegan club."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-humane-societys-descent-into-abolitionist-veganism/article/2005167|title=The Humane Society's Descent Into Abolitionist Veganism|date=2016-11-01|newspaper=Weekly Standard|accessdate=2016-12-30}}</ref>
