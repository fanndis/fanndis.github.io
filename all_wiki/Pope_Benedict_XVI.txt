'''Pope Benedict XVI''' ({{lang-la|Benedictus XVI}}; {{lang-it|Benedetto XVI}}; {{lang-de|link=no|Benedikt XVI.}}; born '''Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger''', {{IPA-de|ˈjoːzɛf ˈalɔʏzi̯ʊs ˈʁatsɪŋɐ|lang}}, 16 April 1927) is a retired [[prelate]] of the [[Catholic Church]] who served as head of the Church and sovereign of the [[Vatican City]] State from 2005 until [[resignation of Pope Benedict XVI|his resignation]] in 2013. Benedict's election as pope occurred in the [[2005 papal conclave]] that followed the death of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Benedict chose to be known by the title "[[bishop in the Catholic Church#Pope emeritus|pope emeritus]]" upon his resignation.<ref name="pope emeritus"/><ref name="pope emeritus ncr">{{cite web | title=Benedict's New Name: Pope Emeritus, His Holiness Benedict XVI, Roman Pontiff Emeritus | url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/benedicts-new-name-pope-emeritus-his-holiness-benedict-xvi-roman-pontiff-em | date=26 February 2013 | access-date=23 June 2018 | first=Edward | last=Petin}}</ref>

Ordained as a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] in 1951 in his native [[Bavaria]], Ratzinger embarked on an academic career and established himself as a highly regarded theologian by the late 1950s. He was appointed a full professor in 1958 at the age 31. After a long career as a professor of theology at several German universities, he was appointed [[Archbishop of Munich and Freising]] and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1977, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 1981, he was appointed Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], one of the most important [[dicasteries]] of the [[Roman Curia]]. From 2002 until his election as pope, he was also [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]]. Prior to becoming pope, he was "a major figure on the [[Holy See|Vatican]] stage for a quarter of a century"; he had an influence "second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions" as one of John Paul II's closest confidants.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Walsh |first1= Mary Ann |title= From Pope John Paul II to Benedict XVI: an inside look at the end of an era, the beginning of a new one, and the future of the church |year= 2005 |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield |isbn= 1-58051-202-X |page= 135}}</ref> He has lived in Rome since 1981.

He views [[relativism]]'s denial of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective truth]], and the denial of [[Moral relativism|moral truths]] in particular, as the central problem of the 21st century.

On 11 February 2013, Benedict unexpectedly announced his resignation in a speech in Latin before the cardinals, citing a "lack of strength of mind and body" due to his advanced age. [[Resignation of Pope Benedict XVI|His resignation]] became effective on 28 February 2013. He is the first pope to resign since [[Gregory XII]] in 1415, and the first to do so on his own initiative since [[Celestine V]] in 1294. As pope emeritus, Benedict retains the [[style (manner of address)|style]] of [[His Holiness]] and continues to dress in the papal colour of white. He was succeeded by [[Pope Francis]] on 13 March 2013, and he moved into the newly renovated [[Mater Ecclesiae Monastery]] for his retirement on 2 May 2013. In his retirement, Benedict XVI has made occasional public appearances alongside Francis.

In addition to his native German, Benedict speaks French, Italian and English<ref>{{cite web | publisher=[[EWTN Television]] | title=World Over – 23 February 2013 – Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger Interview Special with Raymond Arroyo | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKVO_v2FbtE | access-date=23 May 2013}}</ref> fluently.

<!-- Due to the size of the overall article, please consider whether it would be more appropriate to add any additional information to the larger article on the early life of Pope Benedict XVI rather than this one. -->
Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger was born on 16 April, [[Holy Saturday]], 1927, at Schulstraße 11, at 8:30 in the morning in his parents' home in Marktl, Bavaria, Germany. He was baptised the same day. He is the third and youngest child of [[Joseph Ratzinger Sr.]], a police officer, and Maria Ratzinger (née Peintner); his grand-uncle was the German priest-politician [[Georg Ratzinger (politician)|Georg Ratzinger]]. His mother's family was originally from [[South Tyrol]] (now in Italy).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/articolo.asp?c=536395 |title=Vatican Radio – Pope Benedict: proud to be part of Tyrol a "land made by Angels" |publisher=En.radiovaticana.va |date=9 November 2011 |access-date=17 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517123128/http://en.radiovaticana.va/articolo.asp?c=536395 |archive-date=17 May 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Pope Benedict's elder brother, [[Georg Ratzinger]], was a Catholic priest and was the former director of the [[Regensburger Domspatzen]] choir. His sister, Maria Ratzinger, who never married, managed Cardinal Ratzinger's household until her death in 1991.

At the age of five, Ratzinger was in a group of children who welcomed the visiting [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Cardinal Archbishop of Munich]], [[Michael von Faulhaber]], with flowers. Struck by the cardinal's distinctive garb, he announced later that day that he wanted to be a cardinal. He attended the elementary school in [[Aschau am Inn]], which was renamed in his honour in 2009.<ref>{{cite news

Ratzinger and his brother Georg entered Saint Michael Seminary in Traunstein in November 1945, later studying at the [[Ducal Georgianum]] (''Herzogliches Georgianum'') of the [[Ludwig-Maximilian University]] in Munich. They were both ordained in [[Freising]] on 29 June 1951 by Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] of Munich. Ratzinger recalled: "at the moment the elderly Archbishop laid his hands on me, a little bird – perhaps a lark – flew up from the altar in the high cathedral and trilled a little joyful song."<ref>{{cite book |title=Milestones: Memoirs 1927–1977 |url=https://archive.org/details/milestonesmemoir00ratz | url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/milestonesmemoir00ratz/page/99 99] | publisher=[[Ignatius Press]]| year=1998 |language=de| isbn=978-0-89870-702-1 |author=Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger |author2=Erasmo Leiva-Merikakis (translator)}}</ref>

Ratzinger's 1953 dissertation was on [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and was titled ''The People and the House of God in Augustine's Doctrine of the Church''. His [[habilitation]] (which qualified him for a professorship) was on [[Bonaventure]]. It was completed in 1957 and he became a professor of Freising College in 1958.

=== Encounter with Romano Guardini ===
In his early twenties, he was deeply influenced by the thought of Italian German [[Romano Guardini]]<ref>[https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=8547 ''"Ratzinger and Guardini, a Decisive Encounter"''] essay by Silvano Zucal in ''Vita E Pensiero'' Publisher Catholic University of Milan, 1 October 2008</ref> who taught in Munich 1946 to 1951 when Ratzinger was studying in Freising and later at the University of Munich. The intellectual affinity between these two thinkers, who would later become decisive figures for the twentieth-century Church, was preoccupied with rediscovering the essential in Christianity: Guardini wrote his 1938 "The Essence of Christianity," while Ratzinger penned "Introduction to Christianity," three decades later in 1968. Guardini inspired many in the Catholic social-democratic tradition, particularly the Communion and Liberation movement in the ''New Evangelization'' encouraged under the papacy of Polish Pope John Paul II. Ratzinger wrote an introduction to a 1996 reissue of Guardini's 1954 "[[The Lord (book)|The Lord]]".<ref>''"[[The Lord (book)|The Lord]]"'' [https://www.amazon.com/Lord-None-Romano-Guardini/dp/0895267144 by Roman Guardini, 1996, reprint of 1954 first English translation] Regnery Publishing</ref>

===Academic career: 1951–1977===
{{Ratzinger}}
{{Catholic philosophy}}
Ratzinger became a professor at the [[University of Bonn]] in 1959, with his inaugural lecture on "The God of Faith and the God of Philosophy". In 1963, he moved to the [[University of Münster]]. During this period, he participated in the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–1965) and served as a ''[[peritus]]'' (theological consultant) to [[Josef Frings|Cardinal Frings of Cologne]]. He was viewed during the time of the council as a reformer, cooperating with theologians like [[Hans Küng]] and [[Edward Schillebeeckx]]. Ratzinger became an admirer of [[Karl Rahner]], a well-known academic theologian of the [[Nouvelle Théologie]] and a proponent of church reform.

In 1966, Ratzinger was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology at the [[University of Tübingen]], where he was a colleague of [[Hans Küng]]. In his 1968 book ''[[Introduction to Christianity]]'', he wrote that the pope has a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and he downplayed the centrality of the papacy. During this time, he distanced himself from the atmosphere of Tübingen and the [[Marxism|Marxist]] leanings of the student movement of the 1960s that quickly radicalised, in the years 1967 and 1968, culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968. Ratzinger came increasingly to see these and associated developments (such as decreasing respect for authority among his students) as connected to a departure from traditional Catholic teachings.<ref name="sobene">{{cite news |first=David |last=Van Biema |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1053658%2C00.html |title=The Turning Point |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=24 April 2005 |access-date=7 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215042935/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1053658,00.html |archive-date=15 December 2011}}</ref> Despite his reformist bent, his views increasingly came to contrast with the liberal ideas gaining currency in theological circles.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Daniel J. |last1=Wakin |first2=Richard |last2=Bernstein |first3=Mark |last3=Landler |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/international/worldspecial2/24ratzinger.html?position=&incamp=article_popular_5&pagewanted=print&position= |title=Turbulence on Campus in 60's Hardened Views of Future Pope |work=The New York Times |date=24 April 2005 |access-date=8 June 2005 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416205557/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/international/worldspecial2/24ratzinger.html?position=&incamp=article_popular_5&pagewanted=print&position= |archive-date=16 April 2009}}</ref>

Some voices, among them Küng, deem this a turn towards conservatism, while Ratzinger himself said in a 1993 interview, "I see no break in my views as a theologian [over the years]".<ref>{{cite news |work=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C979775-1%2C00.html |title=Keeper of the Straight and Narrow |last1=Ostling |first1=Richard N. |last2=Moody |first2=John |last3=Morris |first3=Nomi |date=6 December 1993 |access-date=10 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823043007/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979775-1,00.html |archive-date=23 August 2012}}</ref> Ratzinger continued to defend the work of the Second Vatican Council, including ''[[Nostra aetate]],'' the document on respect of other religions, [[ecumenism]] and the declaration of the right to [[freedom of religion]]. Later, as the [[Joseph Ratzinger as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], Ratzinger most clearly spelled out the Catholic Church's position on other religions in the 2000 document ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' which also talks about the Catholic way to engage in "[[Catholic Church and ecumenism|ecumenical]] dialogue". During his time at Tübingen University, Ratzinger published articles in the reformist theological journal ''[[Concilium (journal)|Concilium]]'', though he increasingly chose less reformist themes than other contributors to the magazine such as Küng and Schillebeeckx.

In 1969, he returned to Bavaria, to the [[University of Regensburg]] and co-founded the theological journal ''[[Communio]]'', with [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], [[Henri de Lubac]], [[Walter Kasper]] and others, in 1972. ''Communio'', now published in seventeen languages, including German, English and Spanish, has become a prominent journal of contemporary Catholic theological thought. Until his election as pope, he remained one of the journal's most prolific contributors. In 1976, he suggested that the [[Augsburg Confession]] might possibly be recognised as a Catholic statement of faith.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dulles, s.j.|first=Avery|date=October 1983 |title=The Catholicity of the Augsburg Confession|journal=[[The Journal of Religion]]|volume=63|issue=4|pages=337–354|doi=10.1086/487060|author-link=Avery Dulles|jstor=1203403|s2cid=170148693}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Fahlbusch | first1 = Erwin|first2=Geoffrey William |last2= Bromiley |first3=David B. |last3= Barrett | chapter=Evangelical Catholicity|title = The Encyclopedia of Christianity | publisher=Wm.

In the consistory of the following 27 June, he was named Cardinal-Priest of [[Santa Maria Consolatrice al Tiburtino]] by Pope Paul VI. By the time of the 2005 Conclave, he was one of only 14 remaining cardinals appointed by Paul VI, and one of only three of those under the age of 80.

===Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: 1981–2005===
[[File:Ratzinger-Rom88.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Cardinal Ratzinger in Rome, 12 October 1988]]
{{Main|Joseph Ratzinger as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith}}

On 25 November 1981, Pope John Paul II, upon the retirement of [[Franjo Šeper]], named Ratzinger as the Prefect of the [[Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], formerly known as the "Sacred Congregation of the [[Holy Office]]", the historical [[Roman Inquisition]]. Consequently, he resigned his post at Munich in early 1982. He was promoted within the College of Cardinals to become [[Bishop of Velletri-Segni|Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni]] in 1993 and was made the college's vice-dean in 1998 and dean in 2002. Just a year after its foundation in 1990 Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger joined
the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in Salzburg/Austria in 1991.<ref>[http://www.theology.de/theologie/theologen/papstbenediktxvi.php theology] → Biography Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger / Pope Benedict XVI → Mitgliedschaften → EuropAcad → 1991</ref><ref>[http://www.abitur-werne.de/english/religion/bio-pope-benedict.html Biography of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger / Pope Benedict XVI] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114500/http://www.abitur-werne.de/english/religion/bio-pope-benedict.html |date=4 March 2016}} → Mitgliedschaften → EuropAcad → 1991</ref>

Ratzinger defended and reaffirmed Catholic doctrine, including teaching on topics such as [[birth control]], homosexuality and inter-religious dialogue. The theologian [[Leonardo Boff]], for example, was suspended, while others such as [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]] were censured. Other issues also prompted condemnations or revocations of rights to teach: for instance, some posthumous writings of [[Jesuit]] priest [[Anthony de Mello]] were the subject of a [[Notification (Holy See)|notification]]. Ratzinger and the congregation viewed many of them, particularly the later works, as having an element of religious indifferentism (''i.e.'', Christ was "one master alongside others"). In particular, ''Dominus Iesus'', published by the congregation in the jubilee year 2000, reaffirmed many recently "unpopular" ideas, including the Catholic Church's position that "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved." The document angered many Protestant churches by claiming that they are not actually churches, but "ecclesial communities".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000806_dominus-iesus_en.html|title=Dominus Iesus}}</ref>

Ratzinger's 2001 letter ''[[De delictis gravioribus]]'' clarified the confidentiality of internal church investigations, as defined in the 1962 document ''[[Crimen Sollicitationis]]'', into accusations made against priests of certain crimes, including [[sexual abuse]]. This became a subject of controversy during the [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|sex abuse cases]].<ref name="observer-2001-let">{{cite news | first=Jamie | last=Doward | url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1469055,00.html | title=Pope 'obstructed' sex abuse inquiry |work=The Observer |location=London | date=24 April 2005 |access-date=14 July 2007}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20111031044043/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/apr/24/children.childprotection WebCitation archive]</ref> For 20 years, Ratzinger had been the man in charge of enforcing the document.<ref name="BBC2006Doc">''[[Sex Crimes and the Vatican (film)|Sex Crimes and the Vatican]]'' ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/5402928.stm Quotation from an October 2006 BBC documentary]):

On 12 March 1983, Ratzinger, as prefect, notified the lay faithful and the clergy that [[Archbishop]] [[Pierre Martin Ngo Dinh Thuc]] had incurred [[excommunication]] ''[[latae sententiae]]'' for [[valid but illicit|illicit]] [[ordination|episcopal consecrations]] without the apostolic mandate.

===Election to the papacy===
{{Main|Papal conclave, 2005}}

Benedict XVI was [[Papal election|elected]] the [[List of popes|265th pope]] at the age of 78. He is the [[List of ages of Popes|oldest person to have been elected pope]] since [[Pope Clement XII]] (1730–1740). He served longer as a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] before becoming Pope than any Pontiff since [[Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (1724–1730). Benedict and his [[Polish people|Polish]] predecessor [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] were the first consecutive non-Italian popes since the seven consecutive Frenchmen of the [[Avignon Papacy]] (1309–1378). The last pope named Benedict was [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]], an Italian who reigned from 1914 to 1922, during World War I (1914–1918).

On 2 January 2005, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine quoted unnamed Vatican sources as saying that Ratzinger was a front runner to succeed John Paul II should he die or become too ill to continue as pope. On the death of John Paul II, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' gave the odds of Ratzinger becoming pope as 7–1, the lead position, but close to his rivals on the liberal wing of the church. In April 2005, before his election as pope, he was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by ''Time''.<ref name="Time 100">{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1972656_1972691_1973018,00.html | title=Time 100 2005 | work=Time | date=18 April 2005 | access-date=3 April 2013 | author=Sullivan, Andrew}}</ref> While Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger repeatedly stated he would like to retire to his house in the Bavarian village of Pentling near [[Regensburg]] and dedicate himself to writing books.

At the [[Papal conclave|conclave]], "it was, if not Ratzinger, who? And as they came to know him, the question became, why not Ratzinger?"<ref name="goodstein">{{cite news|author=Goodstein, Laurie and Elisabetta Povoledo |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/world/europe/among-cardinals-deep-divisions-over-next-pope.html |title=Before Smoke Rises at Vatican, It's Romans vs. the Reformers |work= New York Times|date= 11 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Ivereigh, Austen |url=http://www.osvdailytake.com/2013/03/ivereigh-in-rome-does-cardinal.html |title=Does cardinal confusion spell a long conclave? |work=Our Sunday Visitor |date=11 March 2013 |access-date=12 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316114559/http://www.osvdailytake.com/2013/03/ivereigh-in-rome-does-cardinal.html |archive-date=16 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 19 April 2005, he was elected on the second day after four ballots.<ref name="goodstein"/> Cardinal [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor]] described the final vote, "It's very solemn when you go up one by one to put your vote in the urn and you're looking up at the Last Judgement of Michelangelo.

Retrieved 21 August 2011 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111228010014/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/02/world/main684865.shtml WebCitation archive]</ref> Before his first appearance on the balcony of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]], he was announced by [[Jorge Medina Estévez]], [[Cardinal Protodeacon]] of the Catholic Church. Cardinal Medina Estévez first addressed the massive crowd as "dear(est) brothers and sisters" in Italian, Spanish, French, German and English, with each language receiving cheers from the international crowd, before continuing with the traditional ''[[Habemus Papam]]'' announcement in Latin.

At the balcony, Benedict's first words to the crowd, given in Italian before he gave the traditional ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' blessing in Latin, were:

{{quote|Dear brothers and sisters, after the great Pope John Paul II, the Cardinals have elected me, a simple, humble labourer in the vineyard of the Lord. The fact that the Lord knows how to work and to act even with insufficient instruments comforts me, and above all I entrust myself to your prayers. In the joy of the Risen Lord, confident of his unfailing help, let us move forward. The Lord will help us, and Mary, His Most Holy Mother, will be on our side. Thank you.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/index_en.htm|title=Election – BENEDICT XVI}}</ref>}}

On 24 April, he celebrated the [[Papal Inauguration]] Mass in [[St. Peter's Square]], during which he was invested with the [[Pallium]] and the [[Ring of the Fisherman]]. On 7 May, he took possession of his cathedral church, the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]].

===Choice of name===
Ratzinger chose the [[papal name|pontifical name]] [[Pope Benedict (disambiguation)|Benedict]], which comes from the Latin word meaning "the blessed", in honour of both [[Pope Benedict XV]] and Saint [[Benedict of Nursia]]. [[Pope Benedict XV]] was pope during the First World War, during which time he passionately pursued peace between the warring nations. St. Benedict of Nursia was the founder of the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monasteries (most monasteries of the Middle Ages were of the Benedictine order) and the author of the ''[[Rule of Saint Benedict]]'', which is still the most influential writing regarding the monastic life of Western Christianity. The Pope explained his choice of name during his first general audience in St. Peter's Square, on 27 April 2005:

{{quote|Filled with sentiments of awe and thanksgiving, I wish to speak of why I chose the name Benedict. Firstly, I remember [[Pope Benedict XV]], that courageous prophet of peace, who guided the Church through turbulent times of war. In his footsteps I place my ministry in the service of reconciliation and harmony between peoples. Additionally, I recall [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict of Nursia]], co-[[patron saint|patron]] of Europe, whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe. I ask him to help us all to hold firm to the centrality of Christ in our Christian life: May Christ always take first place in our thoughts and actions!<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/audiences/2005/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20050427_en.html|title=General Audience of 27 April 2005 – BENEDICT XVI}}</ref>}}

===Tone of papacy===
[[File:Benedikt XVI im Papamobil.jpg|thumb|Pope Benedict XVI's first trip in a [[popemobile]]]]
During his inaugural Mass, the previous custom of every cardinal submitting to the Pope was replaced by having twelve people, including cardinals, clergy, religious, a married couple and their child, and newly [[confirmation|confirmed]] people, greet him. (The cardinals had formally sworn their obedience upon his election.) He began using an open-topped [[Popemobile|papal car]], saying that he wanted to be closer to the people. Pope Benedict continued the tradition of his predecessor John Paul II and baptised several infants in the Sistine Chapel at the beginning of each year, on the [[Baptism of the Lord|Feast of the Baptism of the Lord]], in his pastoral role as Bishop of Rome.

====Beatifications====
On 9 May 2005, Benedict XVI began the [[beatification]] process for his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. Normally, five years must pass after a person's death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Pope Benedict, [[Camillo Ruini]], [[Vicar General]] of the Diocese of Rome and the official responsible for promoting the [[canonization|cause for canonization]] of any person who dies within that diocese, cited "exceptional circumstances" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived. This happened before, when Pope Paul VI waived the five-year rule and announced beatification processes for two of his predecessors, [[Pope Pius XII]] and [[Pope John XXIII]]. Benedict XVI followed this precedent when he waived the five-year rule for John Paul II.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050509_rescritto-gpii_en.html |title=Response of His Holiness Benedict XVI for the examination of the cause for beatification and canonization of the Servant of God John Paul II |publisher=Vatican.va |date=9 May 2005 |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110181753/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050509_rescritto-gpii_en.html |archive-date=10 November 2011}}</ref> The decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of [[Our Lady of Fátima]] and the 24th anniversary of the attempt on John Paul II's life.<ref>{{cite news |author=Drummer, Alexander |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-13001?l=english |title=Waiting Period Waived for John Paul II |agency=[[Zenit News Agency]] |date=13 May 2005 |access-date=24 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001064726/http://www.zenit.org/article-13001?l=english |archive-date=1 October 2012}}</ref> John Paul II often credited Our Lady of Fátima for preserving him on that day.

The first beatification under the new pope was celebrated on 14 May 2005, by [[José Cardinal Saraiva Martins]], Cardinal Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]]. The new Blesseds were [[Mother Marianne Cope]] and [[Mother Ascensión Nicol Goñi]]. Cardinal [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]] was beatified on 9 October 2005. [[Mariano de la Mata]] was beatified in November 2006 and [[Rosa Eluvathingal]] was beatified 3 December of that year, and Fr. [[Basil Moreau]] was beatified September 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.holycrossusa.org/spirituality/our-founder-blessed-basil-moreau-csc/ |title=Our Founder |publisher=[[Congregation of Holy Cross]] |date=24 August 2011 |access-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016095517/http://www.holycrossusa.org/spirituality/our-founder-blessed-basil-moreau-csc/ |archive-date=16 October 2011}}</ref> In October 2008, the following beatifications took place: [[Maria Anna Donati|Celestine of the Mother of God]], Giuseppina Nicoli, Hendrina Stenmanns, Maria Rosa Flesch, Marta Anna Wiecka, [[Michael Sopocko]], [[Petrus Kibe Kasui and 187 Companions]], [[Blessed Candlemas of San José|Susana Paz-Castillo Ramírez]], and Maria Isbael Salvat Romero.

Unlike his predecessor, Benedict XVI delegated the beatification liturgical service to a Cardinal. On 29 September 2005, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued a communiqué announcing that henceforth beatifications would be celebrated by a representative of the pope, usually the prefect of that Congregation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050929_comunicato_en.html |title=Communiqué on beatification process |publisher=Vatican.va |date=29 September 2005 |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103085410/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050929_comunicato_en.html |archive-date=3 November 2011}}</ref>

===Curia reform===
Pope Benedict made only modest changes to the structure of the Roman Curia. In March 2006, he placed both the [[Pontifical Council for Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples]] and the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace]] under a single president, Cardinal [[Renato Martino]]. When Martino retired in 2009, the Councils each received its own preside once again. Also in March 2006, the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]] was briefly merged into the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]] under Cardinal [[Paul Poupard]]. Those Councils maintained their separate officials and staffs while their status and competencies continued unchanged, and in May 2007, Interreligious Dialogue was restored to its separate status again with its own president.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper = National Catholic Reporter |access-date= 2 September 2016 |date= 30 May 2006 | url = https://www.ncronline.org/news/council-interreligious-dialogue-be-restored-vatican-says | title=Council for Interreligious Dialogue to be restored, Vatican says | first = John L. |last= Allen Jr.}}</ref> In June 2010, Benedict created the [[Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation]], appointing Archbishop [[Rino Fisichella]] its first president.<ref>{{cite news |agency= Catholic News Agency | access-date = 2 September 2016 | date = 30 June 2010 | url = http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-appoints-archbishop-fisichella-to-lead-council-for-new-evangelization/ |title= Pope appoints Archbishop Fisichella to lead Council for New Evangelization}}</ref> On 16 January 2013, Pope Benedict transferred responsibility for [[catechesis]] from the [[Congregation for the Clergy]] to the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pope transfers responsibility for catechesis, seminaries|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-transfers-responsibility-for-catechesis-seminaries/|access-date=2 September 2016|agency=Catholic News Agency|date=25 January 2013}}</ref>

===Teachings===
{{See also|Theology of Pope Benedict XVI}}
As pope, one of Benedict XVI's main roles was to teach about the Catholic faith and the solutions to the problems of discerning and living the faith,<ref>Beach, Kevin [http://www.catholicmissionleaflets.org/leafpope.htm "What is the role of the Pope?"] Catholic Mission Leaflets [https://web.archive.org/web/20111012035803/http://catholicmissionleaflets.org/leafpope.htm WebCitation archive]</ref> a role that he could play well as a former head of the Church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The main points of emphasis of his teachings are stated in more detail in Theology of Pope Benedict XVI.

===="Friendship with Jesus Christ"====
At the conclusion of his first homily as pope, Benedict referred to both Jesus Christ and John Paul II. Citing John Paul II's well-known words, "Do not be afraid! Open wide the doors for Christ!", Benedict XVI said:
{{quote|Are we not perhaps all afraid in some way? If we let Christ enter fully into our lives, if we open ourselves totally to Him, are we not afraid that He might take something away from us?...And once again the Pope said: No! If we let Christ into our lives, we lose nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of what makes life free, beautiful and great. No! Only in this friendship do we experience beauty and liberation....When we give ourselves to Him, we receive a hundredfold in return. Yes, open, open wide the doors to Christ&nbsp;– and you will find true life.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20050424_inizio-pontificato_en.html |title=Mass for the Inauguration of the Pontificate of Pope Benedict XVI&nbsp;– Homily of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI |publisher=Vatican.va |date=24 April 2005 |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101130100/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20050424_inizio-pontificato_en.html |archive-date=1 November 2011}}</ref>}}

"Friendship with Jesus Christ" is a frequent theme of his preaching.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/B16CLERO.HTM |title=To the Clergy of Rome, with Response to Interventions by Roman Clergy |publisher=EWTN |date=13 May 2005 |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709184929/http://www.ewtn.com/library/papaldoc/b16clero.htm |archive-date=9 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/pope/words/conclave_homily.asp |title=For Electing the Supreme Pontiff |publisher=EWTN |date=18 April 2005 |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115103236/http://www.ewtn.com/pope/words/conclave_homily.asp |archive-date=15 November 2011}}</ref> He stressed that on this intimate friendship, "everything depends."<ref name=JON/> He also said: "We are all called to open ourselves to this friendship with God... speaking to him as to a friend, the only One who can make the world both good and happy... That is all we have to do is put ourselves at his disposal...is an extremely important message. It is a message that helps to overcome what can be considered the great temptation of our time: the claim, that after the Big Bang, God withdrew from history."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfjosma.htm|title=ST JOSEMARÍA}}</ref> Thus, in his book ''Jesus of Nazareth'', his main purpose was "to help foster [in the reader] the growth of a living relationship" with Jesus Christ.<ref name="JON">{{cite news |author=Drummer, Alexander |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-19369?l=english |title=Benedict XVI's Book a Pastoral Work |agency=Zenit News Agency |date=15 April 2007 |access-date=24 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001064700/http://www.zenit.org/article-19369?l=english |archive-date=1 October 2012}}</ref>

He took up this theme in his first encyclical ''[[Deus caritas est]]''. In his personal explanation and summary of the encyclical, he stated: "If friendship with God becomes for us something ever more important and decisive, then we will begin to love those whom God loves and who are in need of us. God wants us to be friends of his friends and we can be so, if we are interiorly close to them."<ref>{{cite news |author=Drummer, Alexander |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-15211?l=english |title=The Secret of Love, According to Benedict XVI&nbsp;– Pope Explains Encyclical to Readers of Italian Magazine |agency=Zenit News Agency |date=7 February 2006 |access-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811075615/http://www.zenit.org/article-15211?l=english |archive-date=11 August 2011}}</ref> Thus, he said that prayer is "urgently needed... It is time to reaffirm the importance of prayer in the face of the activism and the growing secularism of many Christians engaged in charitable work."

===="Dictatorship of relativism"====
Continuing what he said in the pre-conclave Mass about what he often referred to as the "central problem of our faith today",<ref>Ratzinger, Joseph ''[[Relativism: The Central Problem for Faith Today]]'' [[Eternal Word Television Network|EWTN]] May 1996. Retrieved 8 October 2011 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111006175209/http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/ratzrela.htm WebCitation archive]</ref> on 6 June 2005 Pope Benedict also said:
{{quote|Today, a particularly insidious obstacle to the task of education is the massive presence in our society and culture of that relativism which, recognising nothing as definitive, leaves as the ultimate criterion only the self with its desires. And under the semblance of freedom it becomes a prison for each one, for it separates people from one another, locking each person into his or her own ego.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/june/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050606_convegno-famiglia_en.html "Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the participants in the Ecclesial Diocesan Convention of Rome"] 6 June 2005

He said that "a dictatorship of relativism"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/wyd082105.htm |title=Coverage of World Youth Day exclusively by NCR Report #4: Do-it-yourself religion 'cannot ultimately help us,' pope tells youth |last=Allen, Jr. |first=John L. |newspaper=[[National Catholic Reporter]] |date=21 August 2005 |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927165721/http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/wyd082105.htm |archive-date=27 September 2011 }}</ref> was the core challenge facing the church and humanity. At the root of this problem, he said, is [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s "self-limitation of reason". This, he said, is contradictory to the modern acclamation of science whose excellence is based on the power of reason to know the truth. He said that this self-amputation of reason leads to pathologies of religion such as terrorism and pathologies of science such as [[List of environmental disasters|ecological disasters]].<ref name="TT">{{cite book |title=Truth And Tolerance: Christian Belief And World Religions |last=Ratzinger |first=Joseph |year=2003 |publisher=[[Ignatius Press]]|isbn=1-58617-035-X }}</ref> Benedict traced the failed revolutions and violent ideologies of the 20th century to a conversion of partial points of view into absolute guides.

In an address to a conference of the Diocese of Rome held at the basilica of [[St. John Lateran]] 6 June 2005, Benedict remarked on the issues of [[same sex marriage]] and abortion:
{{quote|The various forms of the dissolution of matrimony today, like free unions, trial marriages and going up to pseudo-matrimonies by people of the same sex, are rather expressions of an anarchic freedom that wrongly passes for true freedom of man...from here it becomes all the more clear how contrary it is to human love, to the profound vocation of man and woman, to systematically close their union to the gift of life, and even worse to suppress or tamper with the life that is born.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/6/6/144634.shtml |title=NewsMax Archives |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609135145/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/6/6/144634.shtml |archive-date=9 June 2012}}</ref>}}

====Christianity as religion according to reason====
In the discussion with [[secularism]] and [[rationalism]], one of Benedict's basic ideas can be found in his address on the "Crisis of Culture" in the West, a day before Pope John Paul II died, when he referred to Christianity as the Religion of the Logos (the Greek for "word", "reason", "meaning", or "intelligence"). He said:
{{quote|From the beginning, Christianity has understood itself as the religion of the ''Logos'', as the religion according to reason... It has always defined men, all men without distinction, as creatures and images of God, proclaiming for them...the same dignity. In this connection, the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is of Christian origin and it is no accident that it was born precisely and exclusively in the realm of the Christian faith....It was and is the merit of the Enlightenment to have again proposed these original values of Christianity and of having given back to reason its own voice... Today, this should be precisely [Christianity's] philosophical strength, in so far as the problem is whether the world comes from the irrational, and reason is not other than a 'sub-product,' on occasion even harmful of its development—or whether the world comes from reason, and is, as a consequence, its criterion and goal...In the so necessary dialogue between secularists and Catholics, we Christians must be very careful to remain faithful to this fundamental line: to live a faith that comes from the ''Logos'', from creative reason, and that, because of this, is also open to all that is truly rational.<ref name=Zenit05>{{cite news |author=Drummer, Alexander |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-13705?l=english |title=Cardinal Ratzinger on Europe's Crisis of Culture (Part 4) |agency=[[Zenit News Agency]] |date=29 July 2005 |access-date=24 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001064719/http://www.zenit.org/article-13705?l=english |archive-date=1 October 2012}}</ref>}}

Benedict also emphasised that "Only creative reason, which in the crucified God is manifested as love, can really show us the way."<ref name=Zenit05 />

Pope Benedict wrote three [[encyclical]]s: ''[[Deus caritas est]]'' (Latin for "God is Love"), ''[[Spe Salvi]]'' ("Saved by Hope"), and ''[[Caritas in veritate]]'' ("Love in Truth"). In his first encyclical, ''Deus caritas est'', he said that a human being, created in the image of God who is love, is able to practice love: to give himself to God and others ([[agape]]) by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation. This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as [[Mother Teresa|Teresa of Calcutta]] and the [[Veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church|Blessed Virgin Mary]], and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them in Jesus Christ.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est_en.html |title=''Deus caritas est'' |publisher=Vatican.va |date=25 December 2005 |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008152102/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est_en.html |archive-date=8 October 2011}}</ref>

The encyclical contains almost 16,000 words in 42 paragraphs. The first half is said to have been written by Benedict in German, his first language, in the summer of 2005; the second half is derived from uncompleted writings left by his predecessor, Pope John Paul II.<ref>Fisher, Ian [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/26/international/europe/26pope.html?pagewanted=all "Benedict's First Encyclical Shuns Strictures of Orthodoxy"] ''The New York Times'' 26 January 2006.

At the time of his resignation, Benedict had completed a draft of a fourth encyclical entitled ''[[Lumen fidei]]'' ("The Light of Faith"),<ref>{{cite news | url = http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/enciclica-papa-el-papa-pope-lumen-fidei-26222/ | title = The light of faith: origin, history and horizon of the christianism |newspaper = [[La Stampa]] | location = Turin | first = Alessandro | last = Speciale | date = 4 July 2013 | access-date = 19 October 2013}}</ref> intended to accompany his first two encyclicals to complete a trilogy on the three [[theological virtues]] of [[faith in Christianity|faith]], [[hope (virtue)|hope]], and [[charity (virtue)|love]]. Benedict's successor, [[Pope Francis]], completed and published ''Lumen Fidei'' in June 2013, four months after Benedict's retirement and Francis' succession. Although the encyclical is officially the work of Pope Francis, paragraph 7 of the encyclical explicitly expresses Francis' debt to Benedict: "These considerations on faith — in continuity with all that the Church's magisterium has pronounced on this theological virtue — are meant to supplement what Benedict XVI had written in his encyclical letters on charity and hope. He himself had almost completed a first draft of an encyclical on faith. For this I am deeply grateful to him, and as his brother in Christ I have taken up his fine work and added a few contributions of my own."<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20130629_enciclica-lumen-fidei_en.html ''Lumen Fidei''], 7</ref>

====Motu proprio on Tridentine Mass====
{{See also|Summorum Pontificum}}
[[File:unchurch.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A pre-1969 [[Tridentine Mass|Traditional Latin Mass]] altar with [[reredos]].<br />]]
On 7 July 2007, Benedict XVI issued the ''[[motu proprio]] [[Summorum Pontificum]]'', declaring that upon "the request of the faithful", celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] according to the [[Tridentine Mass|Missal of 1962]] (commonly known as the Tridentine Mass), was to be more easily permitted. Stable groups who previously had to petition their bishop to have a Tridentine Mass may now merely request permission from their local priest.<ref name="Afica Latin">{{cite news |title=Pope Allows Worldwide Use of Old Latin Mass|publisher=Catholic Information Service for Africa|date=10 July 2007|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200707101009.html}}</ref> While ''Summorum Pontificum'' directs that pastors should provide the Tridentine Mass upon the requests of the faithful, it also allows for any qualified priest to offer private celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, to which the faithful may be admitted if they wish.<ref name="letter Motu">{{cite web|title=Letter of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the Bishops on the Occasion of the Publication of the Apostolic Letter ''Motu Proprio Data'' Summorum Pontificum, On the Use of the Roman Liturgy Prior to the Reform of 1970 |url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html |author=Pope Benedict XVI |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010203101/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html |archive-date=10 October 2011}}</ref> For regularly scheduled public celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, the permission of the priest in charge of the church is required.<ref>Article 5 §4 of the motu proprio</ref>

In an accompanying letter, the Pope outlined his position concerning questions about the new guidelines.<ref name="letter Motu"/> As there were fears that the move would entail a reversal of the Second Vatican Council,<ref name="Jason">{{cite news|title=Criticism over return of Latin Mass |author=Burke, Jason |url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/09/stories/2007070955601600.htm |work=The Hindu |date=9 July 2007 |access-date=4 October 2011 |location=Chennai, India |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108194155/http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/09/stories/2007070955601600.htm |archive-date=8 November 2012 }}</ref> Benedict emphasised that the Tridentine Mass would not detract from the council, and that the [[Mass of Paul VI]] would still be the norm and priests were not permitted to refuse to say the Mass in that form. He pointed out that use of Tridentine Mass "was never juridically abrogated and, consequently, in principle, was always permitted."<ref name="letter Motu"/> The letter also decried "deformations of the liturgy ... because in many places celebrations were not faithful to the prescriptions of the new Missal" as the Second Vatican Council was wrongly seen "as authorising or even requiring creativity", mentioning his own experience.<ref name="letter Motu"/>

The Pope considered that allowing the Tridentine Mass to those who request it was a means to prevent or heal [[schism (religion)|schism]], stating that, on occasions in history, "not enough was done by the Church's leaders to maintain or regain reconciliation and unity" and that this "imposes an obligation on us today: to make every effort to enable for all those who truly desire unity to remain in that unity or to attain it anew."<ref name="letter Motu"/> Many feel the decree aimed at ending the schism between the Holy See and traditionalist groups such as the [[Society of Saint Pius X]] (SSPX). Cardinal [[Darío Castrillón Hoyos]], the president of the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei|Pontifical Commission established for the purpose of facilitating full ecclesial communion of those associated with that Society]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/ced_documents/rc_con_cfaith_20090930_ecclesia-dei_en.html |title=Pontifical Commission 'Ecclesia Dei' |publisher=Vatican.va |access-date=14 June 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911163000/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/ced_documents/rc_con_cfaith_20090930_ecclesia-dei_en.html |archive-date=11 September 2011 }}</ref> stated that the decree "opened the door for their return". Bishop [[Bernard Fellay]], superior general of the SSPX, expressed "deep gratitude to the Sovereign Pontiff for this great spiritual benefit".<ref name="Afica Latin"/>

====Unicity and salvific universality of the Catholic Church====
Near the end of June 2007, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a document approved by Benedict XVI "because some contemporary theological interpretations of [[Vatican II]]'s ecumenical intent had been 'erroneous or ambiguous' and had prompted confusion and doubt."<ref name="Winfield">{{cite news|title=Pope: Other Christians not true churches |first=Nicole |last=Winfield |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-07-10-1587290358_x.htm |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=USA Today |date=10 July 2007 |access-date=18 September 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114133425/http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-07-10-1587290358_x.htm |archive-date=14 November 2009 }}</ref> The document has been seen as restating "key sections of a 2000 text the pope wrote when he was prefect of the congregation, ''Dominus Iesus''."<ref name="Winfield"/>

====Consumerism====
Benedict XVI condemned excessive [[consumerism]], especially among youth. He stated in December 2007 that "[A]dolescents, youths and even children are easy victims of the corruption of love, deceived by unscrupulous adults who, lying to themselves and to them, draw them into the dead-end streets of consumerism."<ref>{{cite news

===Ecumenism and interfaith dialogue===
[[File:Pope Benedict XVI 1.jpg|thumb|right|Pope Benedict XVI on a throne in the [[Apostolic Palace]]]]

====Other Christian denominations====
{{Main|Pope Benedict XVI and ecumenism}}
Speaking at his weekly audience in St Peter's Square on 7 June 2006, Pope Benedict asserted that Jesus himself had entrusted the leadership of the Church to his apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]]. "Peter's responsibility thus consists of guaranteeing the communion with Christ. Let us pray so that the [[primacy of Simon Peter|primacy of Peter]], entrusted to poor human beings, may always be exercised in this original sense desired by the Lord, so that it will be increasingly recognised in its true meaning by brothers who are still not in communion with us."

Also in 2006, Benedict met [[Rowan Williams]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and spiritual head of the [[Anglican Communion]]. In their Common Declaration, they highlighted the previous 40 years of dialogue between Catholics and Anglicans while also acknowledging "serious obstacles to our ecumenical progress".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/november/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20061123_common-decl_en.html |title=Common Declaration of Pope Benedict XVI and the Archbishop of Canterbury His Grace Rowan Williams |publisher=Vatican.va |date=23 November 2006 |access-date=17 February 2013}}</ref> Benedict also acknowledged the [[Lutheran]] church, saying that he has had friends in that denomination.

====Judaism====
{{Main|Pope Benedict XVI and Judaism}}
When Benedict ascended to the Papacy his election was welcomed by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] who noted "his great sensitivity to Jewish history and the [[Holocaust]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/VaticanJewish_96/44698_96.htm|title=ADL Welcomes Election of Cardinal Ratzinger as New Pope|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115060118/http://www.adl.org/PresRele/VaticanJewish_96/44698_96.htm|archive-date=15 January 2013}}</ref> However, his election received a more reserved response from the United Kingdom's Chief Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]], who hoped that Benedict would "continue along the path of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II in working to enhance relations with the Jewish people and the State of Israel."<ref name="BBC4462503">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4462503.stm | title=In quotes: Reaction to Pope election | date=20 April 2005 |work=BBC News | access-date=31 January 2009}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20120305050120/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4462503.stm WebCitation archive]</ref> The Foreign Minister of Israel also offered more tentative praise, though the Minister believed that "this Pope, considering his historical experience, will be especially committed to an uncompromising fight against anti-Semitism."<ref name="BBC4462503"/>

Critics have accused Benedict's papacy of insensitivity towards Judaism. The two most prominent instances were the expansion of the use of the Tridentine Mass and the lifting of the excommunication on four bishops from the [[Society of St. Pius X]] (SSPX). In the Good Friday service, the traditional Mass rubrics include a prayer that asks God to lift the veil so ''they [Jews] may be delivered from their darkness''.

====Islam====
{{Main|Pope Benedict XVI and Islam}}
Pope Benedict's relations with Islam were strained at times. On 12 September 2006 he delivered a lecture which touched on Islam at the University of Regensburg in Germany. He had served there as a professor of theology before becoming Pope, and his lecture was entitled "Faith, Reason and the University—Memories and Reflections". The lecture received much attention from political and religious authorities. Many [[Islamic world|Islamic politicians and religious leaders]] registered their protest against what they labelled an insulting mischaracterisation of Islam, although his focus was aimed towards the rationality of religious violence, and its effect on the religion.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5348436.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Europe – In quotes: Muslim reaction to Pope}}</ref><ref name="BBC1">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5353208.stm |title=Pope sorry for offending Muslims |work=BBC News |date=17 September 2006 |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820032525/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5353208.stm |archive-date=20 August 2011 }}</ref> Muslims were particularly offended by this passage that the Pope quoted in his speech: "Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached."<ref name="BBC1" />

Pope Benedict's main arena for pastoral activity was the Vatican itself, his Christmas and Easter homilies and Urbi et Orbi are delivered from St Peter's Basilica.

Biographer Andrea Tornielli suggested that Cardinal Ratzinger had wanted to take action against Maciel Degollado, but that John Paul II and other high-ranking officials, including several cardinals and notably the Pope's influential secretary [[Stanisław Dziwisz]], prevented him from doing so.<ref name="ncr-maciel" /><ref name="independent-johnpaul">{{cite news |work=The Irish Independent | first=Richard | last=Owen |url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/vatican-tries-to-shift-blame-for-abuse-on-to-john-paul-26646654.html |title=Vatican tries to shift blame for abuse on to John Paul&nbsp;– Europe, World News |date=3 April 2010 |access-date=15 December 2015}}</ref> According to [[Jason Berry]], [[Angelo Sodano#Relationship with Legion of Christ|Angelo Sodano]] "pressured" Cardinal Ratzinger, who was "operating on the assumption that the charges were not justified", to halt the proceedings against Maciel in 1999.<ref name="nationalcatholicreporter.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/update/bn051806.htm |title=Vatican restricts ministry of Legionaries priest founder |work=National Catholic Reporter |first=John L. |last=Allen Jr. |date=18 May 2006 |access-date=14 June 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927170000/http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/update/bn051806.htm |archive-date=27 September 2011 }}</ref> When Maciel was honored by the Pope in 2004, new accusers came forward<ref name="nationalcatholicreporter.org"/> and Cardinal Ratzinger "took it on himself to authorize an investigation of Maciel".<ref name="ncr-maciel" /> After Ratzinger became pope he began proceedings against Maciel and the [[Legion of Christ]] that forced Maciel out of active service in the Church.<ref name="times-7086738" /> On 1 May 2010, the Vatican issued a statement denouncing Maciel's "very serious and objectively immoral acts", which were "confirmed by incontrovertible testimonies" and represent "true crimes and manifest a life without scruples or authentic religious sentiment."

Pope Benedict XVI re-introduced several [[papal garments]] which had fallen into disuse. Pope Benedict XVI resumed the use of the traditional red [[papal shoes]], which had been used since Roman times by popes but which had fallen into disuse during the pontificate of Pope John Paul II. Contrary to the initial speculation of the press that the shoes had been made by the Italian fashion house [[Prada]], the [[Holy See|Vatican]] announced that the shoes were provided by the Pope's personal shoemaker.<ref name="WSJ">Meichtry, Stacy [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114591920439834611 "Does the Pope Wear Prada?"] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. 25 April 2006.

On only one occasion, 21 December 2005, the Pope wore the [[camauro]], the traditional red papal hat usually worn in the winter. It had not been seen since the pontificate of Pope John XXIII (1958–1963). On 6 September 2006, the Pope began wearing the red [[cappello romano]] (also called a saturno), a wide-brimmed hat for outdoor use. Rarely used by John Paul II, it was more widely worn by his predecessors.

The journalist Charlotte Allen describes Benedict as "the pope of aesthetics": "He has reminded a world that looks increasingly ugly and debased that there is such a thing as the beautiful—whether it's embodied in a sonata or an altarpiece or an embroidered cope or the cut of a cassock—and that earthly beauty ultimately communicates a beauty that is beyond earthly things."<ref name="latimes1"/>

===Health===
Prior to his election as pope in 2005, Ratzinger had hoped to retire—on account of age-related health problems, a long-held desire to have free time to write, and the retirement age for bishops (75)—and submitted his resignation as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith three times, but continued at his post in obedience to the wishes of Pope John Paul II. In September 1991, Ratzinger suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, which slightly impaired his eyesight temporarily but which he recovered completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/neuer-papst_aid_93745.html |title=Vor Jahren Ratzinger erlitt Hirnblutung |language=de |publisher=Focus Online |access-date=14 June 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011081327/http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/neuer-papst_aid_93745.html |archive-date=11 October 2012 }}</ref> This was never officially made public—the official news was that Ratzinger had fallen and struck his head against a radiator—but was an open secret known to the conclave that elected him pope.<ref name="op-online.de">{{cite web |url=http://www.op-online.de/nachrichten/welt/gesund-papst-benedikt-xvi-412967.html |title=Wie gesund ist Papst Benedikt XVI.? |language=de |publisher=Op-online.de |date=17 July 2009 |access-date=12 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719071958/http://www.op-online.de/nachrichten/welt/gesund-papst-benedikt-xvi-412967.html |archive-date=19 July 2011 }}</ref>

Following his election in April 2005 there were several rumors about the Pope's health, but none of them were confirmed. Early in his pontificate Benedict XVI predicted a short reign, which led to concerns about his health.<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/bal-te.health21apr21,0,5684034.story "Pope predicted 'short reign' in remarks just after election"] ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' 21 April 2005.

French Cardinal [[Philippe Barbarin]] said that since the first stroke Ratzinger had been suffering from an age-related heart condition, for which he was on medication. In late November 2006 Vatican insiders told the international press that the Pope had had a routine examination of the heart.<ref name="op-online.de"/> A few days later an unconfirmed rumor emerged that Pope Benedict had undergone an operation in preparation for an eventual bypass operation, but this rumor was only published by a small left-wing Italian newspaper and was never confirmed by any Vatican insider.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/5510527.asp?gid=74 |title=Vatican: Pope Benedict's gaffes result of high tension |work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018080510/http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/5510527.asp?gid=74 |archive-date=18 October 2012 }}</ref>

Following the announcement of his resignation, the Vatican revealed that Pope Benedict had been fitted with a [[pacemaker]] while he was still a cardinal, before his election as pope in 2005. The battery in the pacemaker had been replaced three months earlier, a routine procedure, but that did not influence his decision.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/europe/pope-benedict-xvi-says-he-will-retire.html?pagewanted=all "A Statement Rocks Rome, Then Sends Shockwaves Around the World"].

In 2013 it was reported that Benedict has multiple health problems including [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]] and reportedly has fallen out of bed more than once, but the Vatican denied any specific illnesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/12/vatican-denies-pope-emeritus-benedict-xvi-rumours-ill-health_n_3068212.html |title=Vatican Denies Rumours That Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI Is in Serious Ill Health |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |access-date=23 June 2013}}</ref>

In July 2017, Benedict sent a message through his private secretary Monsignor Gänswein for the occasion of the funeral of Cardinal [[Joachim Meisner]], who had suddenly died while on vacation in Germany. In his message, the Pope Emeritus referred to Meisner as a "passionate shepherd and pastor" who found it "difficult to leave his post". The former pope also said that he had spoken on the telephone with Meisner the day before the latter died and related that Meisner was grateful to be on vacation after having been present for the beatification of [[Teofilius Matulionis]] in [[Vilnius]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/07/16/benedict-xvi-cardinal-meisner-was-a-passionate-shepherd-who-found-it-difficult-to-leave-his-post/|title=Benedict XVI: Cardinal Meisner was a 'passionate shepherd' who found it 'difficult to leave his post'|date=16 July 2017|newspaper=Catholic Herald|access-date=26 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926144007/http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/07/16/benedict-xvi-cardinal-meisner-was-a-passionate-shepherd-who-found-it-difficult-to-leave-his-post/|archive-date=26 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Positions on morality and politics==
===Birth control and HIV/AIDS===
In 2005, the pope listed several ways to combat the spread of HIV, including chastity, fidelity in marriage and anti-poverty efforts; he also rejected the use of condoms.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4081276.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Europe – Pope rejects condoms for Africa}}</ref> The alleged Vatican investigation of whether there are any cases when married persons may use condoms to protect against the spread of infections surprised many Catholics in the wake of John Paul II's consistent refusal to consider condom use in response to AIDS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0%2C2144%2C1979145%2C00.html |title=Catholic Church to Ease Ban on Condom Use |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=24 April 2006 |access-date=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819073016/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1979145,00.html |archive-date=19 August 2011}}</ref> However, the Vatican has since stated that no such change in the Church's teaching can occur.<ref name="time.com">{{cite news |author=Israely, Jeff 30 April 2006 |url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/article/0,13005,901060508-1189193,00.html |title=Condom Fight: The Vatican Strikes Back |work=Time |date=30 April 2006 |access-date=2 February 2010 }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20101225123729/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901060508-1189193,00.html WebCitation archive]</ref> ''TIME'' also reported in its edition of 30 April 2006 that the Vatican's position remains what it always has been with Vatican officials "flatly dismiss[ing] reports that the Vatican is about to release a document that will condone any condom use."<ref name="time.com"/>

In March 2009, the pope stated:
<blockquote>I would say that this problem of AIDS cannot be overcome merely with money, necessary though it is. If there is no human dimension, if Africans do not help, the problem cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it. The solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the human dimension of sexuality, that is to say a spiritual and human renewal that would bring with it a new way of behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those who are suffering, a willingness to make sacrifices and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview of the Holy Father Benedict XVI during the flight to Africa |url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2009/march/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20090317_africa-interview_en.html |date=17 March 2009 |access-date=7 October 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011221301/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2009/march/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20090317_africa-interview_en.html |archive-date=11 October 2011 }}</ref></blockquote>

In November 2010, in a book-length interview, the pope, using the example of male prostitutes, stated that the use of condoms, with the intention of reducing the risk of HIV infection, may be an indication that the prostitute is intending to reduce the evil connected with his immoral activity.<ref name="ReferenceA">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith [https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20101221_luce-del-mondo_en.html "Note on the banalization of sexuality Regarding certain interpretations of 'Light of the World'"] [https://web.archive.org/web/20111009174236/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20101221_luce-del-mondo_en.html WebCitation archive]</ref> In the same interview, the pope also reiterated the traditional teaching of the Church that condoms are not seen as a "real or moral solution" to the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]]. Further, in December 2010, the [[Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith]] explained that the pope's statement did not constitute a legitimization of either contraception or prostitution, which remains gravely immoral.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Homosexuality===
{{See also|Homosexuality and the Catholic Church}}
During his time as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), Benedict XVI made several efforts to tackle the issue of homosexuality within the Church and the wider world. In 1986 the CDF sent a letter to all bishops entitled: ''[[On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons]]''. The letter condemned a liberal interpretation of the earlier CDF document ''Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics'', which had led to a "benign" attitude "to the homosexual condition itself". ''On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons'' clarified that the Church's position on homosexuality was that "although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder."<ref name="OPCHP">Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith [http://www.vatican.edu/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html "Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons"] 1 October 1986.

Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs."<ref name="OPCHP" />

In 1992, he again approved CDF documents declaring that homosexual "inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder" and extended this principle to civil law. "Sexual orientation", the document said, was not equivalent to race or ethnicity, and it declared that it was "not unjust discrimination to take sexual orientation into account."<ref name="gland">{{cite news|first=William |last=Saletan |author-link=William Saletan |title=Gland Inquisitor: Pope Benedict's antigay tendencies |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2131019/ |work=Slate |date=29 November 2005 |access-date=30 December 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812182629/http://www.slate.com/id/2131019/ |archive-date=12 August 2011}}</ref>

On 22 December 2008, the pope gave an end-of-year message to the Roman Curia in which he talked about gender and the important distinction between men and women. The pope said that the Church viewed the distinction as central to human nature, and "asks that this order of creation be respected". The Church, he said, must "protect man from self-destruction." He said "something like a human ecology" was needed, adding: "Rain forests deserve indeed to be protected, but no less so does man". He attacked gender theories which he described as "man's attempt at self-emancipation from creation and the Creator."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/december/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20081222_curia-romana_en.html |title=Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the Members of the Roman Curia for the Traditional Exchange of Christmas Greetings |publisher=Vatican.va |date=22 December 2008 |access-date=23 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="gender">{{cite news |first= Tom|last= Kington |author2=Riazat Butt|title= Pope angers campaigners with speech seen as attack on homosexuality |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/24/pope-speech-gender-gay-sexuality |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 24 December 2008|access-date=30 December 2008}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20111016161618/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/24/pope-speech-gender-gay-sexuality WebCitation archive]</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Rachel |last=Donadio |title=The Vatican: In Speech, Pope Calls Homosexual Behavior a Violation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/world/europe/23briefs-INSPEECHPOPE_BRF.html?fta=y |work=The New York Times |date=22 December 2008 |access-date=28 December 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416205552/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/world/europe/23briefs-INSPEECHPOPE_BRF.html?fta=y |archive-date=16 April 2009}}</ref>

Father Lombardi insisted that there had been an overreaction to the pope's remarks: "He was speaking more generally about gender theories which overlook the fundamental difference in creation between men and women and focus instead on cultural conditioning." Nevertheless, the remarks were interpreted as a call to save mankind from homosexuals and transsexuals.<ref name=gender/>

====Same-sex marriage====

Although he didn't mention the topic, his words were interpreted by news media as denunciations of [[same-sex marriage]],<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-denounces-gay-marriage-as-people-manipulating-their-godgiven-gender-to-suit-sexual-choices-8428862.html Pope denounces gay marriage as 'people manipulating their God-given gender to suit sexual choices'].

====Migrants and refugees====
In a message released 14 November 2006, during a Vatican press conference for the 2007 annual observance of [[Refugee#World Refugee Day|World Day for Migrants and Refugees]], the Pope urged the ratification of international conventions and policies that defend all migrants, including refugees, exiles, [[Emergency evacuation|evacuees]] and [[internally displaced person]]s. "The church encourages the ratification of the international legal instruments that aim to defend the rights of migrants, refugees and their families," the Pope said. "Much is already being done for the integration of the families of immigrants, although much still remains to be done."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=22001 |title=Pope Benedict XVI message for 93rd World Day of Migrants and Refugees |publisher=Catholic Online |date=14 November 2006 |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021221338/http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=22001&page=2 |archive-date=21 October 2012 }}and</ref>

Pope Benedict also promoted various UN events, such as [[World Refugee Day]], on which he offered up special prayers for refugees and called for the international community to do more to secure refugees' human rights. He also called on Catholic communities and organizations to offer them concrete help.<ref>Wooden, Cindy {{cite web |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0603503.htm |title=Pope offers prayers to refugees for United Nations' World Refugee Day |publisher=Catholicnews.com |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173344/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0603503.htm |archive-date=29 June 2011 }}</ref>

====China====

In 2007, Benedict sent a letter at Easter to Catholics in China that could have wide-ranging implications for the church's relationship with China's leadership. The letter provides long-requested guidance to Chinese bishops on how to respond to illicitly ordained bishops, as well as how to strengthen ties with the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association|Patriotic Association]] and the Communist government.<ref name="Letter">{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070527_china_en.html |title=Letter of Pope Benedict XVI to Chinese Catholics, 27 May 2007 |publisher=Vatican.va |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906022747/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070527_china_en.html |archive-date=6 September 2011 }}</ref>

====Korea====
On 13 November 2006, Benedict said that the dispute over the [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea nuclear weapons program]] should be resolved through negotiations, in his first public comment on the security issue, a news report said. "The Holy See encourages bilateral or multilateral negotiations, convinced that the solution must be sought through peaceful means and in respect for agreements taken by all sides to obtain the denuclearisation of the [[Korean Peninsula]]." Benedict was talking to the new Japanese ambassador to the Vatican.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-154356074.html "Pope urges talks to make Korean Peninsula nuclear free"]{{dead link|date=July 2019}}{{cbignore}} YON – Yonhap News Agency of Korea 14 November 2006.

====Turkey====

In a 2004 ''[[Le Figaro]]'' interview, Ratzinger said that Turkey, which is demographically Muslim but governmentally [[Secularism in Turkey|secular by virtue of its state constitution]], should seek its future in an association of [[Muslim world|Muslim nations]] rather than the European Union, which Ratzinger stated has Christian roots. He said Turkey had always been "in permanent contrast to Europe and that linking it to Europe would be a mistake".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=31436|title=News Features}}</ref>

Later visiting the country to "reiterate the solidarity between the cultures," it was reported that he made a counter-statement backing [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey's bid to join the EU]]. Prime Minister of Turkey [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], said that the Pope told him in their meeting that while the Vatican seeks to stay out of politics it desires Turkey's membership in the EU.<ref>Krause-Jackson, Flavia and Mark Bentley {{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=a0hofLY1v5.U&refer=europe |title=Pope Benedict Backs Turkey's European Union Bid |publisher=Bloomberg |date=28 November 2006 |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626182256/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=a0hofLY1v5.U&refer=europe |archive-date=26 June 2009}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110629085252/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a0hofLY1v5.U&refer=europe WebCitation archive]</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6192770.stm |title=Pope calls for religious exchange |work=BBC News |date=28 November 2006 |access-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025023949/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6192770.stm |archive-date=25 October 2011 }}</ref> However, the Common Declaration of Pope Benedict XVI and [[Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople]] implied that support for Turkey's membership in the European Union would be contingent on the establishment of religious freedom in Turkey:<ref>Donohue, William [http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?idcategory=34&idSub=160&idArticle=6852 "Pope did not change stance on Turkey and EU"], ''Spero News'', 30 November 2006 [https://web.archive.org/web/20120121121309/http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?idcategory=34&idSub=160&idArticle=6852 WebCitation archive]</ref> "In every step towards unification, minorities must be protected, with their cultural traditions and the distinguishing features of their religion."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/november/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20061130_dichiarazione-comune_en.html |title=Common Declaration by His Holiness Benedict XVI and Patriarch Bartholomew I |publisher=Vatican.va |date=30 November 2006|access-date=17 February 2013}}</ref> The Declaration also reiterates Pope Benedict XVI's call for Europe to preserve its Christian roots.

Also included in ''Charity in Truth'' is advocacy for [[tax choice]]:
<blockquote>One possible approach to development aid would be to apply effectively what is known as fiscal subsidiarity, allowing citizens to decide how to allocate a portion of the taxes they pay to the State. Provided it does not degenerate into the promotion of special interests, this can help to stimulate forms of welfare solidarity from below, with obvious benefits in the area of solidarity for development as well.<ref name=":0" /></blockquote>

===Nuclear energy===
Pope Benedict XVI called for [[nuclear disarmament]]. At the same time, he supported the peaceful use of nuclear energy as a tool for development and the fight against poverty. In his message for the 50th anniversary of the founding of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], he confirmed: "The Holy See, fully approving of the IAEA's goal, has been a member from the organisation's foundation and continues to support its activity."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.karpasha.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=273:pope-calls-for-disarmament-backs-nuke-energy&Itemid=66 |title=Pope calls for disarmament, backs nuke energy |date=13 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713135315/http://news.karpasha.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=273%3Apope-calls-for-disarmament-backs-nuke-energy&Itemid=66 |archive-date=13 July 2011 }}</ref>

The asteroid [[8661 Ratzinger]] was named in his honor for the role he played in supervising the opening of Vatican archives in 1998 to researchers investigating judicial errors against [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and other medieval scientists. The name was proposed by the asteroid's first discoverers, L. D. Schmadel and F. Borngen at Tautenburg.<ref name="nasa">{{cite web|title=8661 Ratzinger (1990 TA13) |work=NASA |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=8661+Ratzinger |access-date=28 February 2013}}</ref>

{{Infobox COA wide
| image             = Coat of Arms of Benedictus XVI.svg
| notes             = The [[coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI]] was designed by then Archbishop [[Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo]] (who later was created a Cardinal) soon after the papal election. Benedict's coat of arms omitted the [[papal tiara]], which traditionally appears in the background to designate the pope's position as a worldly ruler like a king, replacing it with a simple [[mitre]], emphasising his spiritual authority.<ref name="Vatican-COA">Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo, Andrea [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html Coat of Arms of His Holiness Benedict XVI] The Vatican.

| symbolism         = ''Scallop shell'': The symbolism of the scallop shell is multiple; one reference is to [[Saint Augustine]]. While a doctoral candidate in 1953, Ratzinger wrote his thesis ''The People and the House of God in St Augustine's Doctrine of the Church'',<ref>Joseph Ratzinger, http://www.fondazioneratzinger.va/content/fondazioneratzinger/en/joseph-ratzinger.html</ref> and therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this Doctor of the Church.<br />''Moor of Freising'': The Moor's head is an heraldic charge associated with Freising, Germany.<br />''Corbinian's bear'': A legend states that while travelling to Rome, [[Saint Corbinian]]'s pack horse was killed by a bear. He commanded the bear to carry the load. Once he arrived, he released it from his service, and it returned to Bavaria. The implication is that "Christianity tamed and domesticated the ferocity of paganism and thus laid the foundations for a great civilisation in the Duchy of Bavaria." At the same time, Corbinian's bear, as God's beast of burden, symbolises the weight of office that Benedict carried.
