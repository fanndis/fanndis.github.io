Cocaine is now predominantly used for nasal and [[lacrimal duct]] surgery. The major disadvantages of this use are cocaine's potential for [[cardiovascular]] toxicity, [[glaucoma]], and [[mydriasis|pupil dilation]].<ref name="Dwyer2016"/> Medicinal use of cocaine has decreased as other synthetic local anesthetics such as [[benzocaine]], [[proparacaine]], [[lidocaine]], and [[tetracaine]] are now used more often.<ref name="Dwyer2016"/> If vasoconstriction is desired for a procedure (as it reduces bleeding), the anesthetic is combined with a vasoconstrictor such as [[phenylephrine]] or [[epinephrine]]. Some [[otolaryngology]] (ENT) specialists occasionally use cocaine within the practice when performing procedures such as nasal [[cauterization]]. In this scenario dissolved cocaine is soaked into a ball of cotton wool, which is placed in the nostril for the 10–15&nbsp;minutes immediately before the procedure, thus performing the dual role of both numbing the area to be cauterized, and vasoconstriction. Even when used this way, some of the used cocaine may be absorbed through oral or nasal mucosa and give systemic effects.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} An alternative method of administration for ENT surgery is mixed with [[adrenaline]] and [[sodium bicarbonate]], as [[Moffett's solution]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

====Coca leaves====

[[Coca]] leaves are typically mixed with an alkaline substance (such as [[calcium hydroxide|lime]]) and chewed into a wad that is retained in the mouth between gum and cheek (much the same as [[chewing tobacco]] is chewed) and sucked of its juices. The juices are absorbed slowly by the mucous membrane of the inner cheek and by the gastrointestinal tract when swallowed. Alternatively, coca leaves can be infused in liquid and consumed like tea. Ingesting coca leaves generally is an inefficient means of administering cocaine.

Because cocaine is [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] and rendered inactive in the acidic stomach, it is not readily absorbed when ingested alone. Only when mixed with a highly alkaline substance (such as [[Lime (material)|lime]]) can it be absorbed into the bloodstream through the stomach. The efficiency of absorption of orally administered cocaine is limited by two additional factors. First, the drug is partly catabolized by the liver. Second, capillaries in the mouth and esophagus constrict after contact with the drug, reducing the surface area over which the drug can be absorbed. Nevertheless, cocaine metabolites can be detected in the urine of subjects that have sipped even one cup of coca leaf infusion.

Orally administered cocaine takes approximately 30&nbsp;minutes to enter the bloodstream. Typically, only a third of an oral dose is absorbed, although absorption has been shown to reach 60% in controlled settings. Given the slow rate of absorption, maximum [[physiological]] and [[psychotropic]] effects are attained approximately 60&nbsp;minutes after cocaine is administered by ingestion. While the onset of these effects is slow, the effects are sustained for approximately 60&nbsp;minutes after their peak is attained.

Contrary to popular belief, both ingestion and [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] result in approximately the same proportion of the drug being absorbed: 30 to 60%. Compared to ingestion, the faster absorption of insufflated cocaine results in quicker attainment of maximum drug effects. Snorting cocaine produces maximum physiological effects within 40&nbsp;minutes and maximum psychotropic effects within 20&nbsp;minutes, however, a more realistic activation period is closer to 5 to 10&nbsp;minutes. Physiological and psychotropic effects from nasally insufflated cocaine are sustained for approximately 40–60&nbsp;minutes after the peak effects are attained.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barnett G, Hawks R, Resnick R | title = Cocaine pharmacokinetics in humans | journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology | volume = 3 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 353–66 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7242115 | doi = 10.1016/0378-8741(81)90063-5 }}; Jones, supra note 19; Wilkinson ''et al.'', Van Dyke ''et al.''</ref>

[[Coca tea]], an infusion of coca leaves, is also a traditional method of consumption. The tea has often been recommended for travelers in the Andes to prevent [[altitude sickness]].<ref name=luks>{{cite journal | vauthors = Luks AM, McIntosh SE, Grissom CK, Auerbach PS, Rodway GW, Schoene RB, Zafren K, Hackett PH | title = Wilderness Medical Society consensus guidelines for the prevention and treatment of acute altitude illness | journal = Wilderness & Environmental Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 146–55 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20591379 | doi = 10.1016/j.wem.2010.03.002 | url = http://oyyum.net/Wilderness/pdf/wilderness-medical.pdf | df = dmy-all | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121015131014/http://oyyum.net/Wilderness/pdf/wilderness-medical.pdf | archive-date = 15 October 2012 }} {{link note|note=mirror: [http://brad-jackson.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Wilderness-Medicine-Guidelines-for-Treatment-of-Acute-Altitude-Illness-2010.pdf]}}</ref> However, its actual effectiveness has never been systematically studied.<ref name=luks />

In 1986 an article in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' revealed that U.S. [[health food store]]s were selling dried coca leaves to be prepared as an infusion as "Health Inca Tea."<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Siegel RK, Elsohly MA, Plowman T, Rury PM, Jones RT | title = Cocaine in herbal tea | journal = JAMA | volume = 255 | issue = 1 | pages = 40 | date = January 1986 | pmid = 3940302 | doi = 10.1001/jama.255.1.40 }}</ref> While the packaging claimed it had been "decocainized," no such process had actually taken place. The article stated that drinking two cups of the tea per day gave a mild [[stimulation]], increased [[heart rate]], and [[emotional mood|mood]] elevation, and the tea was essentially harmless. Despite this, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] seized several shipments in [[Hawaii]], [[Chicago]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and several locations on the [[East Coast of the United States]], and the product was removed from the shelves.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

====Insufflation====
[[File:Cocaine lines 2.jpg|thumb|Lines of cocaine prepared for insufflation]]
Nasal [[insufflation (medicine)|insufflation]] (known colloquially as "snorting", "sniffing", or "blowing") is a common method of ingestion of recreational powdered cocaine.<ref>{{cite web|title=DrugFacts: Cocaine|url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/cocaine|publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse|access-date=11 July 2015|date=April 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711234545/http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/cocaine|archive-date=11 July 2015}}</ref> The drug coats and is absorbed through the [[mucous membrane]]s lining the [[nasal passages]]. Cocaine's desired euphoric effects are delayed when snorted through the nose by about five minutes. This occurs because cocaine's absorption is slowed by its constricting effect on the blood vessels of the nose.<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> Insufflation of cocaine also leads to the longest duration of its effects (60–90 minutes).<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> When insufflating cocaine, absorption through the nasal membranes is approximately 30–60%, with higher doses leading to increased absorption efficiency.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Any material not directly absorbed through the mucous membranes is collected in [[mucus]] and swallowed (this "drip" is considered pleasant by some and unpleasant by others).

In a study of cocaine users, the average time taken to reach peak subjective effects was 14.6&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="Volkow">{{cite journal | vauthors = Volkow ND, Wang GJ, Fischman MW, Foltin R, Fowler JS, Franceschi D, Franceschi M, Logan J, Gatley SJ, Wong C, Ding YS, Hitzemann R, Pappas N | title = Effects of route of administration on cocaine induced dopamine transporter blockade in the human brain | journal = Life Sciences | volume = 67 | issue = 12 | pages = 1507–15 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10983846 | doi = 10.1016/S0024-3205(00)00731-1 }}</ref> Any damage to the inside of the nose is because cocaine highly constricts blood vessels – and therefore blood and oxygen/nutrient flow – to that area. Nosebleeds after cocaine insufflation are due to irritation and damage of mucus membranes by foreign particles and [[adulterant]]s and not the cocaine itself;{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} as a vasoconstrictor, cocaine acts to reduce bleeding.

Rolled up [[currency|banknotes]], hollowed-out [[pen]]s, cut [[drinking straw|straws]], pointed ends of keys, specialized spoons, long [[fingernails]], and (clean) tampon applicators are often used to insufflate cocaine. Such devices are often called "tooters" by users. The cocaine typically is poured onto a flat, hard surface (such as a mirror, CD case or book) and divided into "bumps," "lines" or "rails," and then insufflated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/cocaine.asp#Terminology |title=Cocaine terminology |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709115212/http://www.cesar.umd.edu/cesar/drugs/cocaine.asp#Terminology |archive-date=9 July 2007  }}</ref> The amount of cocaine in a line varies widely from person to person and occasion to occasion (the purity of the cocaine is also a factor), but one line is generally considered to be a single dose.

====Injection====
[[Drug injection]] by turning the drug into a solution provides the highest blood levels of drug in the shortest amount of time. Subjective effects not commonly shared with other methods of administration include a ringing in the ears moments after injection (usually when in excess of 120&nbsp;milligrams) lasting two to 5&nbsp;minutes including [[tinnitus]] and audio distortion. This is colloquially referred to as a "bell ringer". In a study of cocaine users, the average time taken to reach peak subjective effects was 3.1&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="Volkow" /> The euphoria passes quickly. Aside from the toxic effects of cocaine, there is also danger of circulatory [[embolism|emboli]] from the insoluble substances that may be used to cut the drug. As with all injected [[illicit substances]], there is a risk of the user contracting blood-borne infections if sterile injecting equipment is not available or used. Additionally, because cocaine is a vasoconstrictor, and usage often entails multiple injections within several hours or less, subsequent injections are progressively more difficult to administer, which in turn may lead to more injection attempts and more consequences from improperly performed injection.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

An injected mixture of cocaine and [[heroin]], known as "[[speedball (drug)|speedball]]" is a particularly dangerous combination, as the converse effects of the drugs actually complement each other, but may also mask the symptoms of an overdose. It has been responsible for numerous deaths, including celebrities such as comedians/actors [[John Belushi]] and [[Chris Farley]], [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[River Phoenix]], grunge singer [[Layne Staley]] and actor [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]. Experimentally, cocaine injections can be delivered to animals such as [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] to study the mechanisms of cocaine addiction.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dimitrijevic N, Dzitoyeva S, Manev H | title = An automated assay of the behavioral effects of cocaine injections in adult Drosophila | journal = Journal of Neuroscience Methods | volume = 137 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–4 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15262059 | doi = 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2004.02.023 | s2cid = 19882594 }}</ref>

====Inhalation====
{{See also|Crack cocaine}}
Inhalation by smoking cocaine is one of the several ways the drug is consumed. The onset of cocaine's desired euphoric effects is fastest with inhaling cocaine and begins after 3–5 seconds.<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> In contrast, inhalation of cocaine leads to the shortest duration of its effects (5–15 minutes).<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> The two main ways cocaine is smoked are [[Crack cocaine|freebasing]] and by using cocaine which has been converted to smokable "[[crack cocaine]]". Cocaine is smoked by inhaling the vapor produced when solid cocaine is heated to the point that it sublimates.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/oig/special/9712/appb.htm |title=Appendix B: Production of Cocaine Hydrochloride and Cocaine Base |publisher=US Justice Dep |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130195140/http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/9712/appb.htm |archive-date=30 November 2009  }}</ref> In a 2000 Brookhaven National Laboratory medical department study, based on self reports of 32 abusers who participated in the study,"peak high" was found at mean of 1.4min +/- 0.5&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="Volkow" /> [[Pyrolysis]] products of cocaine that occur only when heated/smoked have been shown to change the effect profile, ''i.e.'' anhydroecgonine methyl ester when co-administered with cocaine increases the dopamine in CPu and NAc brain regions, and has M<sub>1</sub>- and M<sub>3</sub>- receptor affinity.<ref name="GarciaTorres2016">{{cite journal | vauthors = Garcia RC, Torres LH, Balestrin NT, Andrioli TC, Flório JC, de Oliveira CD, da Costa JL, Yonamine M, Sandoval MR, Camarini R, Marcourakis T | title = Anhydroecgonine methyl ester, a cocaine pyrolysis product, may contribute to cocaine behavioral sensitization | journal = Toxicology | volume = 376 | pages = 44–50 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 27129946 | doi = 10.1016/j.tox.2016.04.009 }}</ref>

Smoking freebase or crack cocaine is most often accomplished using a pipe made from a small glass tube, often taken from "[[love rose]]s", small glass tubes with a paper rose that are promoted as romantic gifts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.journalstar.com/news/local/article_28e66c86-1ef8-52dc-ac0a-f3933ed6ec5a.html|title=A rose by another name: crack pipe|newspaper=[[Lincoln Journal Star]]| first = Margaret | last1 = Reist | name-list-style = vanc | date=16 January 2005|access-date=21 August 2009|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726074900/http://journalstar.com/news/local/article_28e66c86-1ef8-52dc-ac0a-f3933ed6ec5a.html|archive-date=26 July 2010}}</ref> These are sometimes called "stems", "horns", "blasters" and "straight shooters". A small piece of clean heavy copper or occasionally stainless steel scouring pad{{spaced ndash}}often called a "brillo" (actual [[Brillo Pad]]s contain soap, and are not used) or "chore" (named for [[Chore Boy]] brand copper scouring pads){{spaced ndash}}serves as a reduction base and flow modulator in which the "rock" can be melted and boiled to vapor. Crack smokers also sometimes smoke through a [[soda can]] with small holes on the side or bottom.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Crack is smoked by placing it at the end of the pipe; a flame held close to it produces vapor, which is then inhaled by the smoker. The effects, felt almost immediately after smoking, are very intense and do not last long{{spaced ndash}} usually 2 to 10 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/cocaine|title=Cocaine {{!}} FRANK|website=www.talktofrank.com|access-date=23 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202020535/http://www.talktofrank.com/drug/cocaine|archive-date=2 February 2017}}</ref> When smoked, cocaine is sometimes combined with other drugs, such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], often rolled into a joint or [[blunt (drug culture)|blunt]]. Powdered cocaine is also sometimes smoked, though heat destroys much of the chemical; smokers often sprinkle it on cannabis.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The language referring to paraphernalia and practices of smoking cocaine vary, as do the packaging methods in the street level sale.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

====Suppository====
Another way users consume cocaine is by making it into a [[suppository]] which they then insert into the anus or vagina. The drug is then absorbed by the membranes of these body parts. Little research has been focused on the suppository (anal or vaginal insertion) method of administration, also known as "plugging". This method of administration is commonly administered using an [[oral syringe]]. Cocaine can be dissolved in water and withdrawn into an oral syringe which may then be lubricated and inserted into the anus or vagina before the plunger is pushed. Anecdotal evidence of its effects is infrequently discussed, possibly due to social taboos in many cultures. The rectum and the vaginal canal is where the majority of the drug would be taken up through the membranes lining its walls.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Chronic===
[[File:Side effects of chronic use of Cocaine.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Side effects of chronic cocaine use]]

Chronic cocaine intake causes strong imbalances of transmitter levels in order to compensate extremes. Thus, receptors disappear from the cell surface or reappear on it, resulting more or less in an "off" or "working mode" respectively, or they change their susceptibility for binding partners (ligands){{spaced ndash}}mechanisms called [[downregulation and upregulation]]. However, studies suggest cocaine abusers do not show normal age-related loss of [[striatum|striatal]] [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT) sites, suggesting cocaine has neuroprotective properties for dopamine neurons.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biological Psychiatry | editor-first1 = Hugo | editor-last1 = D'haenen | editor-first2 = Johan A. | editor-last2 = den Boer | editor-first3 = P. | editor-last3 = Willner | name-list-style = vanc | publisher = Wiley | volume = 2 | edition = 2 | isbn=978-0-471-49198-9|year=2002 |page=528}}</ref> Possible side effects include insatiable hunger, aches, insomnia/oversleeping, lethargy, and persistent runny nose. Depression with suicidal ideation may develop in very heavy users. Finally, a loss of [[vesicular monoamine transporter]]s, neurofilament proteins, and other morphological changes appear to indicate a long term damage of dopamine neurons. All these effects contribute a rise in tolerance thus requiring a larger dosage to achieve the same effect.<ref name="Substance Abuse Textbook">{{cite book |title=Substance abuse: a comprehensive textbook | vauthors = Lowinson JH, Ruiz P, Millman RB  |year=2004 |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |edition=4th |isbn=978-0-7817-3474-5 |page=204 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HtGb2wNsgn4C&pg=PA204#v=onepage |access-date=5 January 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404152414/http://books.google.com/books?id=HtGb2wNsgn4C&pg=PA204#v=onepage |archive-date=4 April 2014  }}</ref>
The lack of normal amounts of serotonin and dopamine in the brain is the cause of the dysphoria and depression felt after the initial high. Physical withdrawal is not dangerous. Physiological changes caused by cocaine withdrawal include vivid and unpleasant dreams, insomnia or hypersomnia, increased appetite and psychomotor retardation or agitation.<ref name="Substance Abuse Textbook" />

Physical side effects from chronic smoking of cocaine include [[hemoptysis|coughing up blood]], [[bronchospasm]], [[pruritus|itching]], [[fever]], diffuse alveolar infiltrates without effusions, pulmonary and systemic [[eosinophilia]], chest pain, lung trauma, sore throat, [[asthma]], hoarse voice, [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath), and an aching, [[flu]]-like syndrome. Cocaine [[Vasoconstriction|constricts blood vessels]], [[Mydriasis|dilates pupils]], and increases body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. It can also cause headaches and gastrointestinal complications such as abdominal pain and nausea. A common but untrue belief is that the smoking of cocaine chemically breaks down [[tooth enamel]] and causes [[tooth decay]]. However, cocaine does often cause involuntary tooth grinding, known as [[bruxism]], which can deteriorate tooth enamel and lead to [[gingivitis]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Baigent |first=Michael | name-list-style = vanc |year=2003|title=Physical complications of substance abuse: what the psychiatrist needs to know |journal=Curr Opin Psychiatry |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=291–296|doi=10.1097/00001504-200305000-00004}}</ref> Additionally, stimulants like cocaine, methamphetamine, and even caffeine cause dehydration and [[Xerostomia|dry mouth]]. Since saliva is an important mechanism in maintaining one's oral pH level, chronic stimulant abusers who do not hydrate sufficiently may experience demineralization of their teeth due to the pH of the tooth surface dropping too low (below 5.5). Cocaine use also promotes the [[thrombosis|formation of blood clots]].<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> This increase in blood clot formation is attributed to cocaine-associated increases in the activity of [[Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1|plasminogen activator inhibitor]], and an increase in the number, activation, and aggregation of [[platelet]]s.<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/>

Chronic intranasal usage can degrade the [[cartilage]] separating the [[nostrils]] (the [[septum nasi]]), leading eventually to its complete disappearance. Due to the absorption of the cocaine from cocaine hydrochloride, the remaining hydrochloride forms a dilute hydrochloric acid.<ref name="pagliaros">{{cite book|first1=Louis|last1=Pagliaro|first2=Ann Marie|last2=Pagliaro|name-list-style=vanc|title=Pagliaros' Comprehensive Guide to Drugs and Substances of Abuse|publisher=[[American Pharmacists Association]]|location=Washington, D.C.|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58212-066-9|url=https://archive.org/details/pagliaroscompreh0000pagl}}</ref>

===Addiction===
{{see also|Epigenetics of cocaine addiction}}
[[Cocaine addiction]] occurs through [[ΔFosB]] overexpression in the [[nucleus accumbens]], which results in altered [[transcriptional regulation]] in neurons within the [[nucleus accumbens]].

ΔFosB levels have been found to increase upon the use of cocaine.<ref name="pmid9668659">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hope BT | title = Cocaine and the AP-1 transcription factor complex | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 844 | issue =  1| pages = 1–6 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9668659 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb08216.x | bibcode = 1998NYASA.844....1H | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230756 }}</ref> Each subsequent dose of cocaine continues to increase ΔFosB levels with no ceiling of tolerance. Elevated levels of ΔFosB leads to increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor ([[BDNF]]) levels, which in turn increases the number of [[dendrite|dendritic]] branches and [[dendritic spine|spines]] present on neurons involved with the nucleus accumbens and [[prefrontal cortex]] areas of the brain.

===Dependence and withdrawal===
[[Cocaine dependence]] is a form of [[psychological dependence]] that develops from regular cocaine use and produces a [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] state with emotional-motivational deficits upon cessation of cocaine use.

===During pregnancy===
Cocaine is known to have a number of deleterious effects during pregnancy. Pregnant people who use cocaine have an elevated risk of [[placental abruption]], a condition where the placenta detaches from the uterus and causes bleeding.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZuBCwAAQBAJ|title=Williams Gynecology, Third Edition |last1=Hoffman |first1=Barbara L. |last2=Schorge|first2=John O. |last3=Bradshaw |first3=Karen D. |last4=Halvorson |first4=Lisa M. |last5=Schaffer |first5=Joseph I. |last6=Corton |first6=Marlene M. | name-list-style = vanc |date=22 April 2016 |publisher=McGraw Hill Professional |isbn=9780071849098 |language=en }}</ref> Due to its vasoconstrictive and hypertensive effects, they are also at risk for [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|hemorrhagic stroke]] and [[myocardial infarction]].

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

The [[pharmacodynamics]] of cocaine involve the complex relationships of neurotransmitters (inhibiting [[monoamine]] uptake in rats with ratios of about: [[5HT|serotonin]]:[[dopamine]] = 2:3, [[serotonin]]:[[norepinephrine]] = 2:5).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rothman RB, Baumann MH, Dersch CM, Romero DV, Rice KC, Carroll FI, Partilla JS | title = Amphetamine-type central nervous system stimulants release norepinephrine more potently than they release dopamine and serotonin | journal = Synapse | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 32–41 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11071707 | doi = 10.1002/1098-2396(20010101)39:1<32::AID-SYN5>3.0.CO;2-3 }} (Table V. on page 37)</ref><ref name=Pom2012/> The most extensively studied effect of cocaine on the [[central nervous system]] is the blockade of the [[dopamine transporter]] protein. Dopamine [[transmitter]] released during neural signaling is normally recycled via the transporter; i.e., the transporter binds the transmitter and pumps it out of the synaptic cleft back into the [[presynaptic]] [[neuron]], where it is taken up into storage [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. Cocaine binds tightly at the dopamine transporter forming a complex that blocks the transporter's function. The dopamine transporter can no longer perform its reuptake function, and thus [[dopamine]] accumulates in the [[synaptic cleft]]. The increased concentration of dopamine in the synapse activates post-synaptic [[dopamine]] receptors, which makes the drug [[Reward system|rewarding]] and promotes the compulsive use of cocaine.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hummel M, Unterwald EM | title = D1 dopamine receptor: a putative neurochemical and behavioral link to cocaine action | journal = Journal of Cellular Physiology | volume = 191 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–27 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11920678 | doi = 10.1002/jcp.10078 }}</ref>

Cocaine affects certain serotonin (5-HT) receptors; in particular, it has been shown to antagonize the [[5-HT3 receptor]], which is a [[ligand-gated ion channel]]. The overabundance of 5-HT3 receptors in cocaine conditioned rats display this trait, however the exact effect of 5-HT3 in this process is unclear.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carta M, Allan AM, Partridge LD, Valenzuela CF | title = Cocaine inhibits 5-HT3 receptor function in neurons from transgenic mice overexpressing the receptor | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 459 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 167–9 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12524142 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-2999(02)02867-4 }}</ref> The [[5-HT2 receptor]] (particularly the subtypes [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT2A]], [[5-HT2B receptor|5-HT2B]] and [[5-HT2C receptor|5-HT2C]]) are involved in the locomotor-activating effects of cocaine.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Filip M, Bubar MJ, Cunningham KA | title = Contribution of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) 5-HT2 receptor subtypes to the hyperlocomotor effects of cocaine: acute and chronic pharmacological analyses | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 310 | issue = 3 | pages = 1246–54 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15131246 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.104.068841 | s2cid = 25809734 }}</ref>

Cocaine has been demonstrated to bind as to directly stabilize the [[Dopamine transporter|DAT]] transporter on the open outward-facing conformation. Further, cocaine binds in such a way as to inhibit a [[hydrogen]] bond innate to [[Dopamine transporter|DAT]]. Cocaine's binding properties are such that it attaches so this hydrogen bond will not form and is blocked from formation due to the tightly locked orientation of the cocaine molecule. Research studies have suggested that the affinity for the transporter is not what is involved in habituation of the substance so much as the conformation and binding properties to where and how on the transporter the molecule binds.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Beuming T, Kniazeff J, Bergmann ML, Shi L, Gracia L, Raniszewska K, Newman AH, Javitch JA, Weinstein H, Gether U, Loland CJ | title = The binding sites for cocaine and dopamine in the dopamine transporter overlap | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 780–9 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18568020 | pmc = 2692229 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2146 }}</ref>

===Pharmacokinetics===
Cocaine has a short half life of 0.7-1.5 hours and is extensively [[metabolism|metabolized]] by [[cholinesterase]] enzymes (primarily in the [[liver]] and [[Blood plasma|plasma]]), with only about 1% excreted unchanged in the urine.<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> The metabolism is dominated by [[hydrolysis|hydrolytic]] [[ester]] cleavage, so the eliminated metabolites consist mostly of [[benzoylecgonine]] (BE), the major [[metabolite]], and other significant metabolites in lesser amounts such as ecgonine methyl ester (EME) and [[ecgonine]].<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> Further minor metabolites of cocaine include [[norcocaine]], p-hydroxycocaine, m-hydroxycocaine, p-[[hydroxybenzoylecgonine]] (pOHBE), and [[m-hydroxybenzoylecgonine]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kolbrich EA, Barnes AJ, Gorelick DA, Boyd SJ, Cone EJ, Huestis MA | title = Major and minor metabolites of cocaine in human plasma following controlled subcutaneous cocaine administration | journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology | volume = 30 | issue = 8 | pages = 501–10 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17132243 | doi = 10.1093/jat/30.8.501 | url = http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=0146-4760&volume=30&issue=8&spage=501&aulast=Kolbrich | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120718083717/http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&issn=0146-4760&volume=30&issue=8&spage=501&aulast=Kolbrich | archive-date = 18 July 2012 | doi-access = free }}</ref> If consumed with [[ethanol|alcohol]], cocaine combines with [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] in the [[liver]] to form [[cocaethylene]].<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> Studies have suggested cocaethylene is both more [[Euphoria|euphoric]], and has a higher [[cardiovascular]] toxicity than cocaine by itself.<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/>

Cocaine in its purest form is a white, pearly product. Cocaine appearing in powder form is a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], typically cocaine [[hydrochloride]]. Street cocaine is often adulterated or "cut" with [[talc]], [[lactose]], [[sucrose]], [[glucose]], [[mannitol]], [[inositol]], [[caffeine]], [[procaine]], [[phencyclidine]], [[phenytoin]], [[lignocaine]], [[strychnine]], [[amphetamine]], or [[heroin]].<ref>{{citation | vauthors = Pillay VV | title=Modern Medical Toxicology | edition=4th | year=2013 | publisher=Jaypee | isbn=978-93-5025-965-8 | pages=553–554}}</ref>{{Dubious|date=March 2019}}

The color of [[crack cocaine|"crack" cocaine]] depends upon several factors including the origin of the cocaine used, the method of preparation – with [[ammonia]] or [[baking soda]] – and the presence of impurities. It will generally range from white to a yellowish cream to a light brown. Its texture will also depend on the adulterants, origin and processing of the powdered cocaine, and the method of converting the base. It ranges from a crumbly texture, sometimes extremely oily, to a hard, almost crystalline nature.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Forms===

====Salts====
Cocaine – a [[tropane alkaloid]] – is a weakly alkaline compound, and can therefore combine with acidic compounds to form salts. The [[hydrochloride]] (HCl) salt of cocaine is by far the most commonly encountered, although the [[sulfate]] (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) and the [[nitrate]] (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) salts are occasionally seen. Different salts dissolve to a greater or lesser extent in various solvents – the hydrochloride salt is polar in character and is quite soluble in water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/cocaine/cocaineh.htm|website=duke.edu|title=Content Background: Chemical Characteristics of Cocaine|accessdate=4 May 2020}}</ref>

====Base====
{{Main|Freebase (chemistry)}}
As the name implies, "freebase" is the [[base (chemistry)|base]] form of cocaine, as opposed to the [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] form. It is practically insoluble in water whereas hydrochloride salt is water-soluble.

Smoking freebase cocaine has the additional effect of releasing [[methylecgonidine]] into the user's system due to the [[pyrolysis]] of the substance (a side effect which [[insufflating]] or injecting powder cocaine does not create). Some research suggests that smoking freebase cocaine can be even more cardiotoxic than other [[routes of administration]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheidweiler KB, Plessinger MA, Shojaie J, Wood RW, Kwong TC | title = Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of methylecgonidine, a crack cocaine pyrolyzate | journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 307 | issue = 3 | pages = 1179–87 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14561847 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.103.055434 | s2cid = 15619796 }}</ref> because of methylecgonidine's effects on lung tissue<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang Y, Ke Q, Cai J, Xiao YF, Morgan JP | title = Evidence for cocaine and methylecgonidine stimulation of M(2) muscarinic receptors in cultured human embryonic lung cells | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 132 | issue = 2 | pages = 451–60 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11159694 | pmc = 1572570 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0703819 }}</ref> and liver tissue.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fandiño AS, Toennes SW, Kauert GF | title = Studies on hydrolytic and oxidative metabolic pathways of anhydroecgonine methyl ester (methylecgonidine) using microsomal preparations from rat organs | journal = Chemical Research in Toxicology | volume = 15 | issue = 12 | pages = 1543–8 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12482236 | doi = 10.1021/tx0255828 }}</ref>

Pure cocaine is prepared by neutralizing its compounding salt with an alkaline solution, which will precipitate to non-polar basic cocaine. It is further refined through aqueous-solvent [[liquid–liquid extraction]].

[[File:Rocks of crack cocaine.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|"Rocks" of crack cocaine]]
Smoking or vaporizing cocaine and inhaling it into the lungs produces an almost immediate "high" that can be very powerful (and addicting) quite rapidly – this initial crescendo of stimulation is known as a "rush". While the stimulating effects may last for hours, the euphoric sensation is very brief, prompting the user to smoke more immediately.

Powder cocaine (cocaine hydrochloride) must be heated to a high temperature (about 197&nbsp;°C), and considerable decomposition/burning occurs at these high temperatures. This effectively destroys some of the cocaine and yields a sharp, acrid, and foul-tasting smoke. Cocaine base/crack can be smoked because it vaporizes with little or no decomposition at {{convert|98|°C|0|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ries |first1=Richard K. |last2=Miller |first2=Sharon C. |last3=Fiellin |first3=David A. | name-list-style = vanc |title=Principles of addiction medicine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j6GGBud8DXcC&pg=PT166#v=onepage |access-date=5 January 2014 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Lippincott Williams & Wilkins]] |isbn=978-0-7817-7477-2 |page=137 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404151454/http://books.google.com/books?id=j6GGBud8DXcC&pg=PT166#v=onepage |archive-date=4 April 2014  }}</ref> which is below the boiling point of water.

Crack is a lower purity form of free-base cocaine that is usually produced by neutralization of cocaine hydrochloride with a solution of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) and water, producing a very hard/brittle, off-white-to-brown colored, amorphous material that contains sodium carbonate, entrapped water, and other by-products as the main impurities. The origin of the name "crack" comes from the "crackling" sound (and hence the [[onomatopoeic]] moniker "crack") that is produced when the cocaine and its impurities (i.e. water, sodium bicarbonate) are heated past the point of vaporization.<ref name=Nelson98>{{cite book |last=George |first=Nelson | name-list-style = vanc |title=Hip Hop America |year=1998 |publisher=Viking Penguin |url={{Google books |8nw6VlsqOUsC|Hip Hop America |page=40 |plainurl=yes}} |page=40 }}</ref>

====Coca leaf infusions====
{{More citations needed|date=April 2014}}
Coca herbal [[infusion]] (also referred to as [[coca tea]]) is used in coca-leaf producing countries much as any herbal medicinal infusion would elsewhere in the world. The free and legal commercialization of dried coca leaves under the form of filtration bags to be used as "coca tea" has been actively promoted by the governments of [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] for many years as a drink having medicinal powers. In Peru, the [[National Coca Company]], a state-run corporation, sells cocaine-infused teas and other medicinal products and also exports leaves to the U.S. for medicinal use.<ref>https://www.businessinsider.com/britain-is-the-worlds-biggest-exporter-of-legal-cocaine-and-heroin-2018-4</ref>

Visitors to the city of [[Cuzco]] in Peru, and [[La Paz]] in Bolivia are greeted with the offering of coca leaf infusions (prepared in teapots with whole coca leaves) purportedly to help the newly arrived traveler overcome the malaise of high altitude sickness. The effects of drinking coca tea are a mild stimulation and mood lift.<ref>https://www.drugs.com/illicit/cocaine.html</ref> It does not produce any significant numbing of the mouth nor does it give a rush like snorting cocaine. In order to prevent the demonization of this product, its promoters publicize the unproven concept that much of the effect of the ingestion of coca leaf infusion would come from the secondary alkaloids, as being not only quantitatively different from pure cocaine but also qualitatively different.

It has been promoted as an adjuvant for the treatment of cocaine dependence. In one controversial study, coca leaf infusion was used—in addition to counseling—to treat 23 addicted coca-paste smokers in [[Lima]], Peru. Relapses fell from an average of four times per month before treatment with coca tea to one during the treatment. The duration of abstinence increased from an average of 32&nbsp;days prior to treatment to 217&nbsp;days during treatment. These results suggest that the administration of coca leaf infusion plus counseling would be an effective method for preventing relapse during treatment for cocaine addiction.

Importantly, these results also suggest strongly that the primary pharmacologically active metabolite in coca leaf infusions is actually cocaine and not the secondary alkaloids.{{synthesis inline|date=April 2014}} The cocaine metabolite [[benzoylecgonine]] can be detected in the urine of people a few hours after drinking one cup of coca leaf infusion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inkanat.com/en/infohealth/mate-coca-tea.html|title=Coca tea or mate de coca – the holy coca leaf infusion|work=inkanat.com|access-date=17 December 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220221155/http://www.inkanat.com/en/infohealth/mate-coca-tea.html|archive-date=20 December 2015}}</ref>

====''N''-methyl-pyrrolinium cation====

The [[biosynthesis]] begins with L-[[Glutamine]], which is derived to L-[[ornithine]] in plants. The major contribution of L-ornithine and L-[[arginine]] as a precursor to the [[tropane]] ring was confirmed by Edward Leete.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leete E, Marion L, Spenser ID | title = Biogenesis of hyoscyamine | journal = Nature | volume = 174 | issue = 4431 | pages = 650–1 | date = October 1954 | pmid = 13203600 | doi = 10.1038/174650a0 | bibcode = 1954Natur.174..650L | s2cid = 4264282 }}</ref> Ornithine then undergoes a [[pyridoxal phosphate]]-dependent decarboxylation to form putrescine.

Hydrolysis of the imine derives ''N''-carbamoylputrescine followed with hydrolysis of the urea to form putrescine. The separate pathways of converting ornithine to putrescine in plants and animals have converged. A SAM-dependent ''N''-methylation of putrescine gives the ''N''-methylputrescine product, which then undergoes oxidative deamination by the action of diamine oxidase to yield the aminoaldehyde. Schiff base formation confirms the biosynthesis of the ''N''-methyl-Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrrolinium cation.

====Robert Robinson's acetonedicarboxylate====
The biosynthesis of the [[tropane alkaloid]], however, is still uncertain. Hemscheidt proposes that Robinson's acetonedicarboxylate emerges as a potential intermediate for this reaction.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/3-540-48146-X|title = Tropane and Related Alkaloids|year = 2000| vauthors = Hemscheidt T, Vederas JC | journal = Top.

Decarboxylation leads to tropane alkaloid formation.

====Reduction of tropinone====
The reduction of tropinone is mediated by [[NADPH]]-dependent reductase enzymes, which have been characterized in multiple plant species.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/0031-9422(92)80247-C|title = Two tropinone reducing enzymes from Datura stramonium transformed root cultures|year = 1992 | vauthors =  Portsteffen A, Draeger B, Nahrstedt A |journal = Phytochemistry|volume = 31|pages = 1135–1138|issue = 4}}</ref> These plant species all contain two types of the reductase enzymes, tropinone reductase I and tropinone reductase II.

===Detection in body fluids===
Cocaine and its major metabolites may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in the forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a sudden death. Most commercial cocaine immunoassay screening tests cross-react appreciably with the major cocaine metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and separately measure each of these substances. When interpreting the results of a test, it is important to consider the cocaine usage history of the individual, since a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate a cocaine-naive individual, and the chronic user often has high baseline values of the metabolites in his system. Cautious interpretation of testing results may allow a distinction between passive or active usage, and between smoking versus other routes of administration.<ref>R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 9th edition, Biomedical Publications, Seal Beach, California, 2011, pp. 390–394.</ref> In 2011, researchers at John Jay College of Criminal Justice reported that dietary zinc supplements can mask the presence of cocaine and other drugs in urine.

===Europe===
Cocaine is the second most popular illegal recreational drug in Europe (behind [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]). Since the mid-1990s, overall cocaine usage in Europe has been on the rise, but usage rates and attitudes tend to vary between countries. European countries with the highest usage rates are the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, and the Republic of Ireland.

Approximately 17 million Europeans (5.1%) have used cocaine at least once and 3.5 million (1.1%) in the last year. About 1.9% (2.3 million) of young adults (15–34 years old) have used cocaine in the last year (latest data available as of 2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/data/stats2018/gps_en|title=Statistical Bulletin 2018 —&nbsp;prevalence of drug use {{!}} www.emcdda.europa.eu|website=www.emcdda.europa.eu|access-date=5 February 2019}}</ref>

Usage is particularly prevalent among this demographic: 4% to 7% of males have used cocaine in the last year in Spain, Denmark, Republic of Ireland, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The ratio of male to female users is approximately 3.8:1, but this statistic varies from 1:1 to 13:1 depending on country.<ref name="European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction">{{cite book | url = http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_64227_EN_EMCDDA_AR08_en.pdf |publisher=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction|title=The State of the Drugs Problem in Europe 2008|location=Luxembourg|year=2008|pages=58–62|access-date=31 December 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425191815/http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_64227_EN_EMCDDA_AR08_en.pdf|archive-date=25 April 2013}}</ref>

It is also popular amongst college students, as a party drug. A study throughout the entire United States has reported that around 48 percent of people who graduated from high school in 1979 have used cocaine recreationally during some point in their lifetime, compared to approximately 20 percent of students who graduated between the years of 1980 and 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connect.mcgraw-hill.com/connect/hmEBook.do?setTab=sectionTabs|title=McGraw-Hill Connect|website=connect.mcgraw-hill.com}}</ref>
Its users span over different ages, races, and professions. In the 1970s and 1980s, the drug became particularly popular in the [[disco]] culture as cocaine usage was very common and popular in many discos such as [[Studio 54]].

===Discovery===
[[File:Folha de coca.jpg|thumb|[[Coca leaf]] in [[Bolivia]]]]
For over a thousand years South American [[Native American (Americas)|indigenous peoples]] have chewed the leaves of ''[[coca|Erythroxylon coca]]'', a plant that contains vital nutrients as well as numerous [[alkaloids]], including cocaine. The coca leaf was, and still is, chewed almost universally by some [[tribe|indigenous communities]]. The remains of coca leaves have been found with ancient Peruvian mummies, and pottery from the time period depicts humans with bulged cheeks, indicating the presence of something on which they are chewing.<ref name="mummies">{{cite journal | vauthors = Altman AJ, Albert DM, Fournier GA | title = Cocaine's use in ophthalmology: our 100-year heritage | journal = Survey of Ophthalmology | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 300–6 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3885453 | doi = 10.1016/0039-6257(85)90153-5 }}</ref> There is also evidence that these cultures used a mixture of coca leaves and saliva as an anesthetic for the performance of [[trepanation]].<ref name="trepanning">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gay GR, Inaba DS, Sheppard CW, Newmeyer JA | title = Cocaine: history, epidemiology, human pharmacology, and treatment. a perspective on a new debut for an old girl | journal = Clinical Toxicology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–78 | year = 1975 | pmid = 1097168 | doi = 10.3109/15563657508988061 }}</ref>

===Isolation and naming===
Although the stimulant and hunger-suppressant properties of coca had been known for many centuries, the isolation of the cocaine [[alkaloid]] was not achieved until 1855. Various European scientists had attempted to isolate cocaine, but none had been successful for two reasons: the knowledge of chemistry required was insufficient at the time,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and contemporary conditions of sea-shipping from South America could degrade the cocaine in the plant samples available to European chemists.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The cocaine alkaloid was first isolated by the German chemist [[Friedrich Gaedcke]] in 1855. Gaedcke named the alkaloid "erythroxyline", and published a description in the journal ''Archiv der Pharmazie.''<ref>{{cite journal|title = Ueber das Erythroxylin, dargestellt aus den Blättern des in Südamerika cultivirten Strauches Erythroxylon Coca| vauthors = Gaedcke F |journal = Archiv der Pharmazie|volume = 132|issue = 2|pages = 141–150|year = 1855|doi = 10.1002/ardp.18551320208| s2cid = 86030231 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1424529 }}</ref>

In 1856, [[Friedrich Wöhler]] asked Dr. [[Carl Scherzer]], a scientist aboard the ''[[SMS Novara (1850)|Novara]]'' (an Austrian [[frigate]] sent by Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] to circle the globe), to bring him a large amount of coca leaves from South America. In 1859, the ship finished its travels and Wöhler received a trunk full of coca. Wöhler passed on the leaves to [[Albert Niemann (chemist)|Albert Niemann]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] student at the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany, who then developed an improved purification process.<ref name=nie1860>{{cite journal|volume = 153|issue = 2|pages = 129–256|year = 1860|title = Ueber eine neue organische Base in den Cocablättern | first = Albert | last = Niemann | name-list-style = vanc |doi = 10.1002/ardp.18601530202|journal = Archiv der Pharmazie|s2cid = 98195820|url = https://zenodo.org/record/1424541}}</ref>

Niemann described every step he took to isolate cocaine in his [[dissertation]] titled ''[[On a New Organic Base in the Coca Leaves|Über eine neue organische Base in den Cocablättern]]'' (''On a New Organic Base in the Coca Leaves''), which was published in 1860—it earned him his PhD and is now in the [[British Library]]. He wrote of the alkaloid's "colourless transparent prisms" and said that "Its solutions have an alkaline reaction, a bitter taste, promote the flow of saliva and leave a peculiar numbness, followed by a sense of cold when applied to the tongue." Niemann named the alkaloid "cocaine" from "coca" (from [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] "kuka") + [[affix|suffix]] "ine".<ref name=nie1860 /><ref>{{OEtymD|Cocaine}}</ref> Because of its use as a [[local anesthetic]], a suffix "-caine" was later extracted and used to form names of synthetic [[local anesthetic]]s.

The first synthesis and elucidation of the structure of the cocaine molecule was by [[Richard Willstätter]] in 1898.<ref name="Humphrey2001" /> It was the first [[biomimetics|biomimetic]] synthesis of an organic structure recorded in academic chemical literature.<ref name="Singh2">{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh S | title = Chemistry, design, and structure-activity relationship of cocaine antagonists | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 100 | issue = 3 | pages = 925–1024 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 11749256 | doi = 10.1021/cr9700538 | url = https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/cocaineanalogs.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193726/https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/pdf/cocaineanalogs.pdf |archive-date = 4 March 2016 | url-status=live | quote = Page 970 (46th page of article) first, ninth, and tenth lines }}</ref><ref>(a) {{cite journal | vauthors = Willstatter R | title = Synthese der Ecgoninsäure | trans-title = Synthesis of Tropine | language = German | journal = Liebigs Ann. | year = 1903 | volume = 326 | issue = 1–2 | page = 23 | doi = 10.1002/jlac.19033260105 }} (b) {{cite journal | vauthors = Robinson RJ | title = LXIII.

With the discovery of this new alkaloid, Western medicine was quick to exploit the possible uses of this plant.

In 1879, Vassili von Anrep, of the [[University of Würzburg]], devised an experiment to demonstrate the analgesic properties of the newly discovered alkaloid. He prepared two separate jars, one containing a cocaine-salt solution, with the other containing merely salt water. He then submerged a frog's legs into the two jars, one leg in the treatment and one in the control solution, and proceeded to stimulate the legs in several different ways. The leg that had been immersed in the cocaine solution reacted very differently from the leg that had been immersed in salt water.<ref name="anrep_frog">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yentis SM, Vlassakov KV | title = Vassily von Anrep, forgotten pioneer of regional anesthesia | journal = Anesthesiology | volume = 90 | issue = 3 | pages = 890–5 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10078692 | doi = 10.1097/00000542-199903000-00033 }}</ref>

[[Karl Koller (ophthalmologist)|Karl Koller]] (a close associate of [[Sigmund Freud]], who would write about cocaine later) experimented with cocaine for [[ophthalmology|ophthalmic]] usage. In an infamous experiment in 1884, he experimented upon himself by applying a cocaine solution to his own eye and then pricking it with pins. His findings were presented to the Heidelberg Ophthalmological Society. Also in 1884, Jellinek demonstrated the effects of cocaine as a [[respiratory system]] anesthetic. In 1885, [[William Halsted]] demonstrated nerve-block anesthesia,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Practical comments on the use and abuse of cocaine| vauthors = Halsted W |journal=New York Medical Journal|year=1885|pages=294–295|volume=42}}</ref> and [[James Leonard Corning]] demonstrated [[peridural]] anesthesia.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Corning JL |year=1885|journal=New York Medical Journal|title=An experimental study|volume=42|page=483}}</ref> 1898 saw [[Heinrich Quincke]] use cocaine for [[spinal anesthesia]].

In 1859, an Italian [[physician|doctor]], [[Paolo Mantegazza]], returned from [[Peru]], where he had witnessed first-hand the use of coca by the local indigenous peoples. He proceeded to experiment on himself and upon his return to [[Milan]] he wrote a paper in which he described the effects. In this paper he declared coca and cocaine (at the time they were assumed to be the same) as being useful medicinally, in the treatment of "a furred tongue in the morning, [[flatulence]], and whitening of the teeth."

A chemist named [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]] who read Mantegazza's paper became immediately intrigued with coca and its economic potential. In 1863, Mariani started marketing a [[wine]] called [[Vin Mariani]], which had been treated with coca leaves, to become [[cocawine]]. The [[ethanol]] in wine acted as a solvent and extracted the cocaine from the coca leaves, altering the drink's effect. It contained 6&nbsp;mg cocaine per ounce of wine, but Vin Mariani which was to be exported contained 7.2&nbsp;mg per ounce, to compete with the higher cocaine content of similar drinks in the United States. A "pinch of coca leaves" was included in [[John Pemberton|John Styth Pemberton]]'s original 1886 recipe for [[Coca-Cola]], though the company began using decocainized leaves in 1906 when the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] was passed.

In 1879 cocaine began to be used to treat [[morphine]] addiction. Cocaine was introduced into clinical use as a [[local anesthetic]] in Germany in 1884, about the same time as [[Sigmund Freud]] published his work ''Über Coca'', in which he wrote that cocaine causes:<ref>{{cite web|title=How a Young Sigmund Freud Researched & Got Addicted to Cocaine, the New "Miracle Drug," in 1894|url=http://www.openculture.com/2014/04/igmund-freud-researched-got-addicted-to-cocaine.html|website=Open Culture|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307204530/http://www.openculture.com/2014/04/igmund-freud-researched-got-addicted-to-cocaine.html|archive-date=7 March 2017}}</ref>

In 1885 the U.S. manufacturer [[Parke-Davis]] sold cocaine in various forms, including cigarettes, powder, and even a cocaine mixture that could be injected directly into the user's veins with the included needle. The company promised that its cocaine products would "supply the place of food, make the coward brave, the silent eloquent and render the sufferer insensitive to pain."

[[File:BEAUTY-COMFORT By Madame Falloppe (1904).jpg|left|thumb|In this 1904 [[advice column]] from ''[[the Tacoma Times]]'', "Madame [[Fallopian tube|Falloppe]]" recommended that [[cold sores]] be treated with a solution of [[borax]], cocaine, and [[morphine]].]]

By the late [[Victorian era]], cocaine use had appeared as a vice in [[literature]]. For example, it was injected by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]], generally to offset the boredom he felt when he was not working on a case.

In early 20th-century [[Memphis, Tennessee]], cocaine was sold in neighborhood drugstores on [[Beale Street]], costing five or ten cents for a small boxful. Stevedores along the Mississippi River used the drug as a stimulant, and white employers encouraged its use by black laborers.<ref name= barlow>{{cite book | last1 = Barlow | first1 = William | name-list-style = vanc | title = Looking Up At Down: The Emergence of Blues Culture | url = https://archive.org/details/lookingupatdowne0000barl | url-access = registration | date = 1989 | publisher = Temple University Press | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 978-0-87722-583-6 | page = [https://archive.org/details/lookingupatdowne0000barl/page/207 207] }}</ref>

In many countries, cocaine is a popular [[recreational drug]]. In the United States, the development of [[crack cocaine|"crack" cocaine]] introduced the substance to a generally poorer inner-city market. Use of the powder form has stayed relatively constant, experiencing a new height of use during the late 1990s and early 2000s in the U.S., and has become much more popular in the last few years in the UK. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}{{When|date=March 2013}}

In 1995 the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute]] (UNICRI) announced in a press release the publication of the results of the largest global study on cocaine use ever undertaken. However, a decision by an American representative in the [[World Health Assembly]] banned the publication of the study, because it seemed to make a case for the positive uses of cocaine. An excerpt of the report strongly conflicted
with accepted paradigms, for example "that occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems." In the sixth meeting of the B committee, the US representative threatened that "If World Health Organization activities relating to drugs failed to reinforce proven drug control approaches, funds for the relevant programs should be curtailed". This led to the decision to discontinue publication. A part of the study was recuperated and published in 2010, including profiles of cocaine use in 20 countries, but are unavailable {{As of|2015|lc=y}}.<ref name=TNI>{{cite web|title=The WHO Cocaine Project|author=WHO/UNICRI|url=http://www.tni.org/article/who-cocaine-project|publisher=Transnational Institute|date=4 February 2010|access-date=8 June 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809073614/http://www.tni.org/article/who-cocaine-project|archive-date=9 August 2012}}</ref>

A problem with illegal cocaine use, especially in the higher volumes used to combat fatigue (rather than increase euphoria) by long-term users, is the risk of ill effects or damage caused by the compounds used in adulteration. Cutting or "stepping on" the drug is commonplace, using compounds which simulate ingestion effects, such as [[Novocain]] (procaine) producing temporary anesthaesia, as many users believe a strong numbing effect is the result of strong and/or pure cocaine, ephedrine or similar stimulants that are to produce an increased heart rate. The normal adulterants for profit are inactive sugars, usually mannitol, creatine or glucose, so introducing active adulterants gives the illusion of purity and to 'stretch' or make it so a dealer can sell more product than without the adulterants.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The adulterant of sugars allows the dealer to sell the product for a higher price because of the illusion of purity and allows sale of more of the product at that higher price, enabling dealers to significantly increase revenue with little additional cost for the adulterants. A 2007 study by the [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] showed that the purity levels for street purchased cocaine was often under 5% and on average under 50% pure.<ref>{{cite web|title=EMCDDA Retail Cocaine Purity Study|year=2007|author=EMCDDA|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/stats09/ppptab7a|access-date=31 December 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101041854/http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/stats09/ppptab7a|archive-date=1 January 2014}}</ref>

==Society and culture==

===Legal status===
{{Main|Legal status of cocaine}}
The production, distribution, and sale of cocaine products is restricted (and illegal in most contexts) in most countries as regulated by the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], and the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]]. In the United States the manufacture, importation, possession, and distribution of cocaine are additionally regulated by the 1970 [[Controlled Substances Act]].

Some countries, such as Peru and Bolivia, permit the cultivation of coca leaf for traditional consumption by the local [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous population]], but nevertheless, prohibit the production, sale, and consumption of cocaine.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/19/bolivia-cocaine-bar-route-36|title=The world's first cocaine bar|last=Franklin|first=Jonathan | name-list-style = vanc |date=18 August 2009|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=23 December 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112142609/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/19/bolivia-cocaine-bar-route-36|archive-date=12 January 2017}}</ref> The provisions as to how much a coca farmer can yield annually is protected by laws such as the Bolivian [[Cato accord]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grisaffi |first1=Thomas | name-list-style = vanc |title=The Cato Accord: Bolivia's Humane and Effective Approach to Controlling Coca Cultivation|url=http://ain-bolivia.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Cato-Accord-Bolivias-Humane-and-Effective-Approach-to-Controlling-Coca-Cultivation.pdf|website=ain-bolivia.org|access-date=12 January 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503160349/http://ain-bolivia.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Cato-Accord-Bolivias-Humane-and-Effective-Approach-to-Controlling-Coca-Cultivation.pdf|archive-date=3 May 2016}}</ref> In addition, some parts of Europe, the United States, and Australia allow processed cocaine for medicinal uses only.

===Economics===
Because of the drug's potential for addiction and overdose, cocaine is generally treated as a "[[hard and soft drugs|hard drug]]", with severe penalties for possession and trafficking. Demand remains high, and consequently, black market cocaine is quite expensive. Unprocessed cocaine, such as [[coca leaves]], are occasionally purchased and sold, but this is exceedingly rare as it is much easier and more profitable to conceal and smuggle it in powdered form. The scale of the market is immense: 770 [[tonne]]s times $100 per gram retail = up to $77 billion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

====Production====
Colombia is as of 2019 the world's largest cocaine producer, with production more than tripling since 2013.<ref name="CIA World Factbook">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/co.html Colombia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513074502/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/co.html |date=13 May 2009 }}.

There was a 28% increase from the amount of potentially harvestable coca plants which were grown in Colombia in 1998. This, combined with crop reductions in Bolivia and Peru, made Colombia the nation with the largest area of [[cocaine production in Colombia|coca under cultivation]] after the mid-1990s. Coca grown for traditional purposes by indigenous communities, a use which is still present and is permitted by Colombian laws, only makes up a small fragment of total coca production, most of which is used for the illegal drug trade.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

An interview with a coca farmer published in 2003 described a mode of production by [[acid-base extraction]] that has changed little since 1905. Roughly {{convert|625|lb|kg}} of leaves were harvested per [[hectare]], six times per year. The leaves were dried for half a day, then chopped into small pieces with a string trimmer and sprinkled with a small amount of powdered cement (replacing [[sodium carbonate]] from former times). Several hundred pounds of this mixture were soaked in {{convert|50|USgal|L}} of gasoline for a day, then the gasoline was removed and the leaves were pressed for remaining liquid, after which they could be discarded. Then [[battery acid]] (weak [[sulfuric acid]]) was used, one bucket per {{convert|25|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of leaves, to create a [[phase (matter)|phase]] separation in which the cocaine [[free base]] in the gasoline was acidified and extracted into a few buckets of "murky-looking smelly liquid". Once powdered [[caustic soda]] was added to this, the cocaine precipitated and could be removed by filtration through a cloth. The resulting material, when dried, was termed ''[[cocaine paste|pasta]]'' and sold by the farmer. The 3750&nbsp;pound yearly harvest of leaves from a hectare produced {{convert|2.5|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of ''pasta''<!--- note that this figure is only about ⅓ of the figure inferred from the numbers below --->, approximately 40–60% cocaine. Repeated recrystallization from solvents, producing ''pasta lavada'' and eventually crystalline cocaine were performed at specialized laboratories after the sale.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ceLzaeHsZAC&pg=PA462|title=Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography | last = Streatfeild | first = Dominic | name-list-style = vanc |publisher=Macmillan|year=2003|isbn=978-0-312-42226-4|access-date=5 January 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115082648/http://books.google.com/books?id=9ceLzaeHsZAC&pg=PA462|archive-date=15 January 2014}}</ref>

Attempts to eradicate coca fields through the use of [[defoliants]] have devastated part of the farming economy in some coca growing regions of Colombia, and strains appear to have been developed that are more resistant or immune to their use. Whether these strains are natural mutations or the product of human tampering is unclear. These strains have also shown to be more potent than those previously grown, increasing profits for the drug cartels responsible for the exporting of cocaine. Although production fell temporarily, coca crops rebounded in numerous smaller fields in Colombia, rather than the larger plantations.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The cultivation of coca has become an attractive economic decision for many growers due to the combination of several factors, including the lack of other employment alternatives, the lower profitability of alternative crops in official crop substitution programs, the eradication-related damages to non-drug farms, the spread of new strains of the coca plant due to persistent worldwide demand.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

====Synthesis====
Synthetic cocaine would be highly desirable to the illegal drug industry as it would eliminate the high visibility and low reliability of offshore sources and international smuggling, replacing them with clandestine domestic laboratories, as are common for illicit [[methamphetamine]]. However, natural cocaine remains the lowest cost and highest quality supply of cocaine. Actual full synthesis of cocaine is rarely done. Formation of inactive [[stereoisomers]] (cocaine has 4 chiral centres – 1''R'', 2''R'', 3''S'', and 5''S'', 2 of them dependent, hence a total potential of 8 possible stereoisomers) plus synthetic by-products limits the yield and purity.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
Names like "synthetic cocaine" and "new cocaine" have been misapplied to [[phencyclidine]] (PCP) and various [[designer drug]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

====Trafficking and distribution====
[[File:CocaineCharango-Opened.jpg|thumb|Cocaine smuggled in a [[charango]], 2008]]
[[Organized crime|Organized criminal]] gangs operating on a large scale dominate the cocaine trade. Most cocaine is grown and processed in South America, particularly in Colombia, [[Bolivia]], Peru, and smuggled into the United States and Europe, the United States being the world's largest consumer of cocaine,<ref name="WFK Illicit drugs">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2086.html |title=Field Listing – Illicit drugs (by country) |publisher=Cia.gov |access-date=15 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229044611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2086.html |archive-date=29 December 2010  }}</ref> where it is sold at huge markups; usually in the US at $80–120 for 1&nbsp;gram, and $250–300 for 3.5&nbsp;grams ({{sfrac|1|8}} of an ounce, or an "eight ball").<ref>{{cite web|title=How Much Is a Gram of Coke?|url=http://www.newhealthadvisor.com/How-Much-Is-a-Gram-of-Coke.html|website=New Health Advisor|date=3 September 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307123722/http://www.newhealthadvisor.com/How-Much-Is-a-Gram-of-Coke.html|archive-date=7 March 2017}}</ref>

=====Caribbean and Mexican routes=====
{{as of| 2005}}, cocaine shipments from South America transported through [[Mexico]] or [[Central America]] were generally moved over land or by air to staging sites in northern Mexico. The cocaine is then broken down into smaller loads for smuggling across the [[US-Mexico border|U.S.–Mexico border]]. The primary cocaine importation points in the United States have been in [[Arizona]], southern [[California]], southern [[Florida]], and [[Texas]]. Typically, land vehicles are driven across the U.S.–Mexico border. Sixty-five percent of cocaine enters the United States through Mexico, and the vast majority of the rest enters through Florida.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Robert | name-list-style = vanc | title = Illegal drugs: America's anguish | date = 2006 | publisher = Thomson Gale | location = Farmington Hills, Michigan | isbn = 978-1-4144-0419-6 | edition = 2005 | url = https://archive.org/details/illegaldrugsamer00jaco }}</ref>{{page needed|date=December 2015}} {{As of|2015}}, the [[Sinaloa Cartel]] is the most active [[drug cartel]] involved in smuggling illicit drugs like cocaine into the United States and trafficking them throughout the United States.<ref name="DEA 2015 assessment">{{cite web|title=2015 National Drug Threat Assessment Summary|url=http://www.dea.gov/docs/2015%20NDTA%20Report.pdf|website=Drug Enforcement Administration|publisher=United States Department of Justice: Drug Enforcement Administration|access-date=10 April 2016|pages=1–2|date=October 2015|quote=Mexican TCOs pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.

Cocaine traffickers from Colombia and Mexico have established a labyrinth of [[smuggling]] routes throughout the Caribbean, the Bahama Island chain, and South Florida. They often hire traffickers from Mexico or the [[Dominican Republic]] to transport the drug using a variety of smuggling techniques to U.S. markets. These include airdrops of {{convert|500|to|700|kg|-2|abbr=on}} in the [[Bahama Islands]] or off the coast of [[Puerto Rico]], mid-ocean boat-to-boat transfers of {{convert|500|to|2000|kg|-2|abbr=on}}, and the commercial shipment of tonnes of cocaine through the port of [[Miami]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

=====Chilean route=====
Another route of cocaine traffic goes through Chile, which is primarily used for cocaine produced in Bolivia since the nearest seaports lie in northern Chile. The arid Bolivia–Chile border is easily crossed by 4×4 vehicles that then head to the seaports of [[Iquique]] and [[Antofagasta]]. While the price of cocaine is higher in Chile than in Peru and Bolivia, the final destination is usually Europe, especially Spain where drug dealing networks exist among South American immigrants.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=====Techniques=====
Cocaine is also carried in small, concealed, kilogram quantities across the border by couriers known as "[[mule (smuggling)|mules]]" (or "mulas"), who cross a border either legally, for example, through a port or airport, or illegally elsewhere. The drugs may be strapped to the waist or legs or hidden in bags, or hidden in the body. If the mule gets through without being caught, the gangs will reap most of the profits. If he or she is caught, however, gangs will sever all links and the mule will usually stand trial for trafficking alone.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Bulk cargo ships are also used to smuggle cocaine to staging sites in the western Caribbean–[[Gulf of Mexico]] area. These vessels are typically 150–250-foot (50–80&nbsp;m) coastal freighters that carry an average cocaine load of approximately 2.5 tonnes. Commercial fishing vessels are also used for smuggling operations. In areas with a high volume of recreational traffic, smugglers use the same types of vessels, such as [[go-fast boat]]s, as those used by the local populations.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Sophisticated [[narco-submarine|drug subs]] are the latest tool drug runners are using to bring cocaine north from Colombia, it was reported on 20 March 2008. Although the vessels were once viewed as a quirky sideshow in the drug war, they are becoming faster, more seaworthy, and capable of carrying bigger loads of drugs than earlier models, according to those charged with catching them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/03/20/drug.subs/index.html|title=Coast Guard hunts drug-running semi-subs|access-date=20 March 2008|publisher=CNN|date=20 March 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321111250/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/03/20/drug.subs/index.html|archive-date=21 March 2008}}</ref>

====Sales to consumers====
[[File:Flavcocaine.jpg|thumb|Cocaine adulterated with fruit flavoring]]

Cocaine is readily available in all major countries' metropolitan areas. According to the ''Summer 1998 Pulse Check'', published by the U.S. [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]], cocaine use had stabilized across the country, with a few increases reported in [[San Diego]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], Miami, and [[Boston]]. In the West, cocaine usage was lower, which was thought to be due to a switch to [[methamphetamine]] among some users; methamphetamine is cheaper, three and a half times more powerful, and lasts 12–24&nbsp;times longer with each dose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://methproject.org/Meth_Info/education.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327140334/http://methproject.org/Meth_Info/education.php |archive-date=27 March 2010|title=Meth Info |publisher=Methproject.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denisonia.com/policeDept/amphetamines.asp|title=Drugs of Abuse|work=City of Denison Iowa|access-date=13 November 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106092215/http://www.denisonia.com/policeDept/amphetamines.asp|archive-date=6 November 2011}}</ref> Nevertheless, the number of cocaine users remain high, with a large concentration among urban youth.

In addition to the amounts previously mentioned, cocaine can be sold in "bill sizes": {{As of|2007}} for example, $10 might purchase a "dime bag", a very small amount (0.1–0.15&nbsp;g) of cocaine. Twenty dollars might purchase 0.15–0.3&nbsp;g. However, in lower Texas, it is sold cheaper due to it being easier to receive: a dime for $10 is 0.4 g, a 20 is 0.8–1.0&nbsp;g and an 8-ball (3.5 g) is sold for $60 to $80, depending on the quality and dealer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} These amounts and prices are very popular among young people because they are inexpensive and easily concealed on one's body. Quality and price can vary dramatically depending on supply and demand, and on geographic region.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/9414607 |title=Drugs: Pricing Power |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=28 June 2007 |quote=Prices: USA around $110/g, Israel/Germany/Britain around $46/g, Colombia $2/g, New Zealand recordbreaking $714.30/g. |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040602/http://www.economist.com/node/9414607 |archive-date=6 January 2014  }}</ref><!--OLD URL:http://www.economist.com/daily/chartgallery/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9414607-->

In 2008, the [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] reports that the typical retail price of cocaine varied between €50 and €75 per gram in most European countries, although Cyprus, Romania, Sweden and Turkey reported much higher values.<ref>{{cite book |author=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction |title=Annual report: the state of the drugs problem in Europe |year=2008 |publisher=Office for Official Publications of the European Communities |location=Luxembourg |isbn=978-92-9168-324-6 |page=59 |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_64227_EN_EMCDDA_AR08_en.pdf |access-date=31 December 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425191815/http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_64227_EN_EMCDDA_AR08_en.pdf |archive-date=25 April 2013  |author-link=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction }}</ref>

====Consumption====
World annual cocaine consumption, as of 2000, stood at around 600 tonnes, with the United States consuming around 300 t, 50% of the total, Europe about 150 t, 25% of the total, and the rest of the world the remaining 150 t or 25%.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/policy/sections/policy_offices/solic/cn/cocaine2.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911061809/http://www.defenselink.mil/policy/sections/policy_offices/solic/cn/cocaine2.pdf|archive-date=11 September 2008|title=The Cocaine Threat: A Hemispheric Perspective|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]}}</ref> It is estimated that 1.5 million people in the United States used cocaine in 2010 down from 2.4 million in 2006.<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/> Conversely, cocaine use appears to be increasing in Europe with the highest prevalences in [[Spain]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].<ref name="Zimmerman2012"/>

The 2010 UN [[World Drug Report]] concluded that "it appears that the North American cocaine market has declined in value from US$47 billion in 1998 to US$38 billion in 2008. Between 2006 and 2008, the value of the market remained basically stable".<ref name="Nations2010">{{cite book|author=United Nations|title=World Drug Report 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HB9PuEhHahQC&pg=PA77|date=June 2010|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=978-92-1-148256-0|page=77|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426034255/https://books.google.com/books?id=HB9PuEhHahQC&pg=PA77|archive-date=26 April 2016}}</ref>
