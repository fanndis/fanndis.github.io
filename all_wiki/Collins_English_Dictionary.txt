The '''''Collins English Dictionary''''' is a printed and online [[dictionary]] of English. It is published by [[HarperCollins]] in [[Glasgow]].<ref name="HCUK History">{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/corporate/about-us/history/|website=www.harpercollins.co.uk|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=11 June 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611134631/https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/corporate/about-us/history/|archivedate=11 June 2019|location=[[Glasgow]]|year=2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The edition of the dictionary in 1979 with [[Patrick Hanks]] as editor and Laurence Urdang as editorial director, was the first British English dictionary to be typeset from the output from a computer database in a specified format. This meant that every aspect of an entry was handled by a different editor using different forms or templates. Once all the entries for an entry had been assembled, they were passed on to be keyed into the slowly assembled dictionary database which was completed for the typesetting of the first edition. {{citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=See Talk}}

In a later edition, they increasingly used the [[Bank of English]] established by John Sinclair at [[COBUILD]] to provide typical citations rather than examples composed by the [[lexicographer]].
