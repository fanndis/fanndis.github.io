'''Dominique Marie François René Galouzeau de Villepin''' ({{IPA-fr|dɔminik də vilpɛ̃|lang|Fr-Dominique de Villepin.ogg}}; born 14 November 1953) is a French politician who served as [[Prime Minister of France]] from 31 May 2005 to 17 May 2007 under President [[Jacques Chirac]].

In his career working at the [[Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], De Villepin rose through the ranks of the French right as one of Chirac's protégés. He came into the international spotlight as Minister of Foreign Affairs with his opposition to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], one year after his appointment to the office, which culminated with a speech to the United Nations.<ref>[[s:French address on Iraq at the UN Security Council|French address on Iraq at the UN Security Council]].</ref> Before his tenure as Prime Minister, he also served as Minister of the Interior (2004–2005).

After being replaced by [[François Fillon]] as Prime Minister, De Villepin was indicted in connection with the [[Clearstream affair|''Clearstream'' affair]],<ref name="charged">"[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/27/europe/EU-GEN-France-Political-Scandal.php Villepin faces charges in smear campaign in France]", ''International Herald Tribune'', 27 July 2007.</ref><ref name="De Villepin likely to face conspiracy charges">{{Cite news|title=De Villepin likely to face conspiracy charges|date=6 July 2007|accessdate=6 July 2007|work=The Times |location=UK |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article2033979.ece  | first=Charles | last=Bremner}}</ref> but was subsequently cleared of charges of complicity in allowing [[false accusations]] to proceed against presidential rival [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] regarding bribes paid on a sale of warships to [[Taiwan]].<ref name="BBC">{{citation | title = France ex-PM Villepin cleared of Sarkozy smear | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8484728.stm | date = 28 January 2010 |work=BBC News }}</ref> De Villepin enjoyed a modest return to public favour for his public critique of President Sarkozy's style of "imperial rule."<ref name="Top politicians warn of 'Sarkozy the monarch'">{{Cite news|title=Top politicians warn of 'Sarkozy the monarch' | date=18 February 2008 | accessdate=18 February 2008 |work=The Independent |location=UK |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/top-politicians-warn-of-sarkozy-the-monarch-783553.html  | first=John | last=Lichfield}}</ref>

He has written poetry, a book about poetry, and several historical and political essays, along with a study of [[Napoleon]]. Villepin is an honorary member of the [[International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation]].

==Early life and education==
Villepin was born in [[Rabat, Morocco]], and spent some time in [[Venezuela]], where his family lived for four years. He then lived in the U.S., and has said that he "grew up in the United States". During his teenage years, "the '[[Beat generation]]' movement left its mark on me, so did the hippie movement".<ref name="huffingtonpost.com">Devecchio, Alexandre; Sarkozy’s "Worst Nightmare": An Interview With Dominique de Villepin; Huffington Post; https://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexandre-devecchio/dominique-de-villepin-interview_b_1277007.html</ref> He was inspired by Jack Kerouac and other American poets. He graduated from the [[Lycée Français de New York]] in 1971.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lfnyalumni.org|title=AALFNY: Home|website=www.lfnyalumni.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}</ref> He has three children: [[Marie de Villepin|Marie]] (b. 1986), Arthur, and Victoire (b. 1989).

Contrary to what his surname suggests, Villepin is not from an aristocratic background but from a middle-class family. His ancestors added the particle "de" to the family name.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/6752087/Nicolas-Sarkozy-has-the-last-laugh-on-aristocratic-rivals.html|title=Nicolas Sarkozy has the last laugh on 'aristocratic' rivals|first=Henry|last=Samuel|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=8 December 2009}}</ref> His great-grandfather was a [[colonel]] in the French army, his grandfather was a board member for several companies, and his father [[Xavier de Villepin]] was a diplomat and a member of the [[French Senate|Senate]]. Villepin speaks French, English and Spanish.

When his mother died, Villepin gave a eulogy "full of the grandest and most sonorous cadences of the French language", wrote ''The Independent'' (UK) in 2010. He "spoke of his mother's passionate belief in the greatness and the destiny of France, and, implicitly, the greatness and destiny of her son". One mourner stated that he seemed to speak "of France and of himself as being the same thing".<ref>Lichfield, John; Dominique de Villepin: Top of the fops; The Independent; 30 January 2010; https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/dominique-de-villepin-top-of-the-fops-1883683.html</ref>

==Career==
===Diplomat===
Villepin studied at the [[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]] (Sciences Po) and went on to the [[École nationale d'administration]] (ENA), France's highly selective post-graduate school which trains its top civil servants. Villepin also holds degrees in Civil law and French literature from the universities of [[Panthéon-Assas University|Panthéon-Assas]] and [[Paris X Nanterre]]. At the end of his studies, he completed his military service as a naval officer on board the Aircraft Carrier Clemenceau. Villepin then entered a career in diplomacy. His assignments were:
*Advising Committee on African affairs (1980–1984)
*The French embassy in Washington, D.C. (1984–1989), as ''premier secrétaire'' until 1987 and then ''deuxième conseiller''
*The embassy in New Delhi (1989–1992), as ''deuxième conseiller'' until 1990 and then ''premier conseiller''
*Foreign Ministry's top adviser on Africa (1992–1993)

===Early political positions===
Villepin was introduced to Jacques Chirac in the early 1980s and became one of his advisers on foreign policy. In 1993 he became chief of staff (''directeur de cabinet'') of [[Alain Juppé]], the [[Foreign Minister (France)|Foreign Minister]] in [[Édouard Balladur]]'s cabinet, who was Chirac's political [[heir apparent]].

Villepin then became director of Chirac's successful 1995 presidential campaign and was rewarded with the key job of Secretary-General of the [[Élysée Palace]] during Chirac's first term as [[president of France|President of the Republic]] (1995–2002). He advised the president to hold an early general election in 1997, while the [[French National Assembly]] was overwhelmingly dominated by the president's party. This was a risky gamble, and Chirac's party went on to lose the elections. Villepin offered Chirac his resignation afterwards, but it was turned down. Villepin's flawed advice on the election increased the perception among many politicians on the right that Villepin had no experience or understanding of grassroots politics, and owed his enviable position only to being Chirac's protégé.

Villepin has had an uneasy relationship with the members of his own political side. He has in the past made a number of demeaning remarks about members of parliament from his own party. In addition, the mutual distaste between Villepin and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], head of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) majority party, is well known.

===Foreign minister===
[[File:Powell villepin.jpg|thumb|Dominique de Villepin with U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]], 2003]]
[[File:Tehran Declaration - 21 October 2003 - Joschka Fischer, Hassan Rouhani, Dominique de Villepin and Jack Straw (2).png|thumb|Villepin next to [[Hassan Rouhani]] during talks on the Iranian nuclear program]]
He was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs by Chirac in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]] at the beginning of Chirac's second term in 2002.

During the [[2004 Haitian coup d'état|2004 coup d'état]] in Haiti, Villepin obtained the backing of the [[United States Secretary of State]], [[Colin Powell]], in his bid to oust [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] from power.

Villepin's most famous assignment as Chirac's foreign minister was opposing the U.S. plan to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invade]] [[Iraq]], giving France a leading role in the grouping of countries such as Germany, Belgium, Russia and China that opposed the invasion. The speech<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.org.tr/documents/villepin_140203_p.htm |title=Statement by Dominique de Villepin to the UNSC |publisher=Foreignpolicy.org.tr |date=14 February 2003 |accessdate=5 November 2010}}</ref> he gave to the UN to block a second resolution allowing the use of force against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime received loud applause.

During mid-2003 Villepin organized the [[Opération 14 juillet]] that attempted to rescue his former student, [[Ingrid Betancourt]], who was being held by [[FARC]] rebels in Colombia. The operation failed, and because he had neither informed Colombia, Brazil, nor President Chirac of the mission, it resulted in a political scandal.

===Interior minister===
During the cabinet reshuffle that made [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] [[Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry (France)|Finance Minister]], Villepin was appointed to replace him as [[List of Interior Ministers of France|interior minister]] on 31 March 2004.

His actions against radical Islam included mandatory courses for Muslim clerics, notably in the French language (as indications were that one-third of them may not have been fluent in the national language), in moderate Muslim theology and in French secularism: ''[[laïcité]]'', [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|Republican principles]] and the law. While Sarkozy created the [[French Council of the Muslim Faith]], an official body which is now dominated by Orthodoxes, Villepin would have preferred a "Muslim foundation", in which mosque-based representatives would be balanced by secular Muslims.

He also cracked down on radical Muslim clerics, causing an uproar when he tried to expel Abdelkader Bouziane, an [[imam]] alleged to have said to the press that, according to Ancient Islamic texts, adulterous people could be whipped or [[stoning|stoned]]. When the decision to expel him was overturned by the courts, because of the journalistic reporting of LyonMag was deemed biased, Villepin pushed a change of the law through Parliament, and Bouziane was sent home.

===Prime Minister of France===
[[File:ANAJ Matignon 2006.jpg|thumb|Villepin speaking at the [[Hôtel Matignon]] in 2006]]
President Chirac was at one point thought to have turned his eye on Villepin as a possible successor, assuming that he himself would not enter the 2007 presidential contest. However, Nicolas Sarkozy was chosen to represent the centre-right UMP party.

On 29 May 2005, French voters in the [[French referendum on the European Constitution|referendum]] on the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] turned down the proposed document by a wide margin. Two days later, Raffarin resigned and Chirac appointed Villepin as [[Prime Minister of France]].

====Villepin's cabinet====
In an address to the nation, Chirac had declared that the new cabinet's top priority would be to curb unemployment, which was consistently hovering above 10%, calling for a "national mobilization" to that effect.

Villepin's cabinet was marked by its small membership (for France), and its hierarchical unity: all members had the rank of Minister, and there were no Secretaries of State, the lowest cabinet member rank. The aim of this decision was for the cabinet to form a close-knit and more efficient team to combat unemployment.

The economy was growing sluggishly and a significant drop in unemployment was yet to be seen. Villepin's aim was therefore to restore the French people's trust in their government, an achievement for which he publicly set himself a deadline of a hundred days from the appointment of cabinet.

Another issue was the [[European Constitution]], rejected by France and the Netherlands in referenda.

After Pope Benedict XVI was widely chastized for appearing to criticize Islam in a speech on 12 September 2006, French author Robert Redeker came to the pontiff's defense, in response to which he received death threats that forced him and his family to go into hiding. Villepin commented that "everyone has the right to express their opinions freely – at the same time that they respect others, of course". The lesson of this episode, according to Villepin, was "how vigilant we must be to ensure that people fully respect one another in our society".<ref>ENTRETIEN DU PREMIER MINISTRE, M. DOMINIQUE DE VILLEPIN, AVEC "RMC" ; AmbaFrance; 29 September 2006; https://web.archive.org/web/20100616155124/http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/Entretien-du-Premier-ministre-sur.html</ref>

Some had speculated that Villepin, with his diplomatic experience and the prestige associated with the job of Prime Minister, would negotiate a new treaty with the [[European Union]], while Sarkozy would run the country at home. However, Villepin obtained favorable reviews from the press and temporarily increased popularity in polls. In particular, he was increasingly cited as a possible [[2007 French presidential election|presidential candidate for 2007]], although Nicolas Sarkozy had publicly stated that he himself was giving considerable attention to that election. Villepin and Sarkozy initially avoided any open division.

Villepin declared that lowering unemployment was the number one objective of his government (which had also been stated by other prime ministers before him, albeit to no avail). He, as well as the UMP party, believed that France's workforce rules were too rigid and discouraged employment, and that some liberalizing reforms were necessary in order to "correct" the French social model.

On 2 August 2005 he issued [[Ordonnance (French constitutional law)|ordinances]] establishing a new kind of work contract (called ''CNE'') for small enterprises, with fewer guarantees than ordinary contracts. While Villepin's measures would surely have been approved by his wide UMP majority in Parliament. Villepin said the government needed to act fast, especially when Parliament was going on its summer recess.

On 16 January 2006 he announced a similar kind of work contract (called ''[[Contrat première embauche]]'', or ''CPE'') for young people (under 26). The parliament approved on 8 February. Subsequently, students started to [[2006 labor protests in France|protest]]. This wave of protest eventually forced the government to give in. Although the law on the ''CPE'' is formally still valid, the government promised to hinder its application and initiated a new legal initiative which will abolish the key points of the ''CPE''. During the protests, Villepin was widely perceived as stubborn and arrogant. As a consequence, his popularity rates went down rapidly and he was no longer regarded as a serious contender for the 2007 presidential election.

Another major issue in Villepin's government was the state of the national budget. France runs high deficits, which run afoul of the rules set in the EU [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Villepin's margin of maneuver in that respect was extremely slim.

====''Contrat Première Embauche'' and strikes====
{{Main|First Employment Contract}}
On Thursday, 16 March 2006, tens of thousands of French university and school students marched to demand the government scrap a contentious youth jobs clause, known as First Employment Contract (CPE). The law, intended as a response to the [[2005 civil unrest in France|2005 riots]], was intended to stimulate job growth and reduce the country's high youth unemployment rate by allowing employers to fire employees aged under 26 within the first two years of their employment for any or no reason. Supporters of the law argued that such probationary arrangements are not unusual in Western countries and that the current system in France discourages employers from hiring people whom they may be unable to fire if they prove unsuitable for the job. Critics argue that it discriminates unnecessarily against the young and decreases job security. The union movement issued an ultimatum to Villepin to scrap the law by 20 March or face a general strike. This ultimatum expired without concession. A general strike was called for 28 March.

On 28 March, between one and three million people demonstrated across France. The protests were accompanied by some violence and 800 people were arrested, 500 of them in Paris. Prime Minister Villepin refused to withdraw the CPE but called for negotiations on adapting it. The demonstrators for the most part called for the complete withdrawal of the CPE.

The CPE was withdrawn by Jacques Chirac on 10 April.<ref name="NZHerald">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=10377013 |title=French students set for jobs law 'victory march' |date=11 April 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref>

====2006 National Assembly debate====
[[File:Villepin Pinault Cueff.jpg|thumb|Dominique de Villepin, 2006]]
On 20 June 2006, during the questions to government in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]], Dominique de Villepin accused the head of the Socialist Party [[François Hollande]] of cowardice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/12/cri/2005-2006/20060247.asp |title=Assemblée nationale ~ Deuxième séance du mardi 20 juin 2006 |publisher=Assemblee-nationale.fr |accessdate=5 November 2010}}</ref> Hollande had questioned the Prime Minister about the recent "[[insider trading]]" scandal involving the aerospace company [[EADS]] and executive [[Noël Forgeard]]. This triggered an incident in the Assembly, with Socialist deputies converging on the government benches until they were stopped by the Assembly ushers. Hollande demanded apologies and the resignation of the Prime Minister;<ref>[http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=391985 Libération – Toute l'actualité monde, politique, société, culture, débats... sur Liberation.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701171139/http://www.liberation.fr/page.php?Article=391985 |date=1 July 2006 }}</ref> the next day, Dominique de Villepin apologized. This event resulted in criticism even from Villepin's own [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] party, with UMP parliamentarians including Assembly vice-president [[Yves Bur]] suggesting that president [[Jacques Chirac|Chirac]] should appoint another Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web |author=e-TF1 |url=http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/france/0,,3311088,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522192356/http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/france/0,,3311088,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 May 2007 |title=Assemblée : Villepin présente ses excuses à Hollande – France – LCI |publisher=Tf1.lci.fr |accessdate=5 November 2010 }}</ref>

====Clearstream affair====
In 2004, French judges were given a list by an anonymous source containing the names of politicians and others who, it was alleged, had deposited kickbacks from a 1991 arms sale to Taiwan into secret accounts at Clearstream, a private bank in Luxembourg. The most prominent name on the list was that of Nicolas Sarkozy, Villepin's rival for power in the UMP. The list was later shown to be fraudulent, a discovery Villepin kept from the public for 15 months at a time when the two men were vying for party supremacy.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/france/story/0,,2123207,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London  | title=De Villepin could face charges over smear plot against Sarkozy | first=Angelique | last=Chrisafis | date=11 July 2007 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> Meanwhile, the source of the list was later revealed to be a longtime associate of Villepin's, one Jean-Louis Gergorin, an executive at EADS. Critics claimed that Villepin, perhaps with the support of then-president Jacques Chirac, had tried to defame his rival. Sarkozy, in turn, filed a suit against whoever was behind the creation of the Clearstream list. Villepin was eventually acquitted in 2010<ref>{{cite journal|title=French court acquits Dominique de Villepin of slander and forgery|journal=The Guardian|date=28 January 2010|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/28/france}}</ref> (see [[#Clearstream trial]] below).

====Possible presidential bid====
There was speculation that Villepin might be a candidate in the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 Presidential election]]; Interior minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] was selected unopposed as the UMP's presidential candidate on 14 January 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6260275.stm |work=BBC News   | title=Sarkozy nod for presidential run | date=14 January 2007 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> On 12 March 2007 Villepin formally endorsed Sarkozy for President.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/world/europe/13france.html | work=The New York Times | title=French Premier Throws Support for Presidency to Political Rival | first=Elaine | last=Sciolino | date=13 March 2007 | accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>

===Resignation===
[[File:Passation de pouvoir - François Fillon - Dominique de Villepin.jpg|thumb|Dominique de Villepin after his resignation]]
On 15 May 2007, the last full day of President [[Jacques Chirac]]'s term, Villepin tendered his resignation from the office of Prime Minister and it was accepted by the President.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/salle_de_presse/communiques_de_la_presidence/2007/mai/demission_du_gouvernement_communique.76618.html |title=Démission du gouvernement: communiqué. – Présidence de la République |publisher=Elysee.fr |date=21 December 2009 |accessdate=5 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002223656/http://www.elysee.fr/elysee/elysee.fr/francais/salle_de_presse/communiques_de_la_presidence/2007/mai/demission_du_gouvernement_communique.76618.html |archivedate=2 October 2007}}</ref> He was replaced two days later by [[François Fillon]].

==Post Prime Ministerial career==
===Context of Villepin's political career===
Villepin has never held elected office; the [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]] allows the president to appoint unelected ministers. This is a political liability for him, because he is periodically accused of being out of touch with the realities of ordinary citizens.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} He is also reported to despise elected officials, calling members of Parliament ''connards'' (assholes).{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Villepin is not the first "unelected" prime minister, even in the relatively short history of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]: notable predecessors include [[Georges Pompidou]], who was a banker before being called to office, and [[Raymond Barre]], who had a previous career as a professor and appointed official, and started an elected career only after being Prime minister.

===Clearstream trial===
On the first day of the civil trial for his part in the Clearstream affair, Villepin accused President Sarkozy of pursuing him for political reasons. Sarkozy has the status of a civil plaintiff in the case.<ref>[http://www.alalam.ir/english/detail.aspx?id=80490 "Villepin Rejects Sarkozy Slander Charges"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182440/http://www.alalam.ir/english/detail.aspx?id=80490 |date=3 March 2016 }}</ref>

On Thursday, 28 January 2010, the judgement was finally handed down and Villepin was acquitted of every accusation against him in the affair.
The following morning the prosecution announced that it would file an appeal against this verdict, thus further dragging out the affair another year. Villepin was finally cleared by an appeals court in September 2011.<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/0915/1224304142392.html "Appeals court clears de Villepin of smear charges'']

=== République Solidaire and presidential run===
In 2010, Villepin quit the UMP and set up a new party, [[United Republic (France)|République Solidaire]], with the aim of running for president in the 2012 elections.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Guardian |location=UK |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/14/sarkozy-villepin-manifesto-president-2012|title= Sarkozy's arch-enemy Villepin outlines his political manifesto|date=14 April 2011|author=Angelique Chrisafis}}</ref> He advocated the rewithdrawal of France from the NATO integrated military command.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/8451583/Nicolas-Sarkozy-rival-Dominique-de-Villepin-outlines-manifesto.html|title=Nicolas Sarkozy rival Dominique de Villepin outlines manifesto|date=14 April 2011|author= Henry Samuel}}</ref> However, he failed to secure the 500 necessary "parrainages" endorsements from elected officials in the preliminaries to the presidential race, and his candidacy did not proceed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/election-presidentielle-2012/20120316.OBS3887/en-direct-villepin-renonce-a-sa-candidature.html|title=EN DIRECT.

In 2016, the French investigating judge Sabine Kheris requested that the case be referred to the Court of Justice of the Republic Dominique de Villepin, [[Michel Barnier]] and [[Michèle Alliot-Marie]]. These former ministers are suspected of having allowed the exfiltration of the mercenaries responsible for the attack on the Bouaké camp in 2004, killing nine French soldiers. The operation was allegedly intended to justify a response operation against the [[Laurent Gbagbo]] government in the context of the 2004 crisis in [[Ivory Coast]].<ref>https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2016/04/BENVENUTO/55185</ref>
