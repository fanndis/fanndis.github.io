Ladd was married to actor and one-time co-star [[Bruce Dern]] from 1960 to 1969, and had two daughters; Diane Elizabeth Dern, who died at 18 months, and actress [[Laura Dern]].

==Career==
In 1971, Ladd joined the cast of the CBS soap opera, ''[[The Secret Storm]]''. She was the second actress to play the role of Kitty Styles on the long-running daytime serial. She later had a supporting role in [[Roman Polanski]]'s 1974 film ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', and was nominated for an Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] for her role as [[Florence Jean Castleberry|Flo]] in the film ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]''. That film inspired the television series ''[[Alice (American TV series)|Alice]]'', in which Flo was portrayed by [[Polly Holliday]]. When Holliday left the TV series, Ladd succeeded her as waitress [[Belle Dupree|Isabelle "Belle" Dupree]].
[[File:DianeLaddHWOFMay2013.jpg|thumb|left|Diane Ladd in 2013 at the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]  to honor actress [[Olympia Dukakis]]]]

She appeared in the independent [[screwball comedy]] ''[[Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me (film)|Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me]]'' in 1992, where she played a flirty, aging Southern belle alongside her real mother, actress Mary Lanier.<ref name="lat">{{cite news|title=Romantic 'Hold Me, Thrill Me' a Breezy Minor Diversion|first=Kevin|last=Thomas|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1993-07-30/entertainment/ca-18333_1_minor-diversion|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 30, 1993|accessdate=June 8, 2013|archive-date=May 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512225746/http://articles.latimes.com/1993-07-30/entertainment/ca-18333_1_minor-diversion|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1993, Ladd appeared in the episode "Guess Who's Coming to Chow?" of the [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] comedy/[[Western (genre)|western]] series ''[[Harts of the West]]'' in the role of the mother of co-star [[Harley Jane Kozak]]. The 15-episode program, set on a [[dude ranch]] in [[Nevada]], starred [[Beau Bridges]] and [[Lloyd Bridges]].

[[File:Diane Ladd as Lucille.jpg|thumb|right|Ladd as Lucille in ''[[Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me (film)|Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me]]''.<ref name="lat"/>]]In 2004, Ladd played [[psychic]] Mrs. Druse in the television miniseries of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Kingdom Hospital]]''. In April 2006, Ladd released her first book, ''Spiraling Through The School of Life: A Mental, Physical, and Spiritual Discovery''. In 2007, she co-starred in the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]] film ''[[Montana Sky]]''.

In addition to her Academy Award nomination for ''Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore'', she was also nominated (again in the Best Actress in a Supporting Role category) for both ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'' and ''[[Rambling Rose (film)|Rambling Rose]]'', both of which she starred alongside her daughter [[Laura Dern]]. Dern received a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for ''Rambling Rose''. The dual mother and daughter nominations for Ladd and Dern in ''Rambling Rose'' marked the first time in [[Academy Awards]] history that such an event had occurred. They were also nominated for dual [[Golden Globe Award]]s in the same year.

Ladd has also worked in theatre. She made her Broadway debut in ''[[Carry Me Back to Morningside Heights]]'' in 1968. In 1976, she starred in ''[[A Texas Trilogy: Lu Ann Hampton Laverty Oberlander]]'', for which she received a [[Drama Desk Award]] nomination.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?id=48718 Internet Broadway Database profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305193503/http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?id=48718 |date=March 5, 2007 }}, Ibdb.com; retrieved July 31, 2011.</ref>
