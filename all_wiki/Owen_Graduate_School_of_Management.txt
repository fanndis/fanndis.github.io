==History==
Vanderbilt University Owen Graduate School of Management has been in operation since 1969, but the university's first proposal for a business education program came from its Board of Trust (BOT) in 1881. They called it the Commercial College Department. No program was established then, however, and it was the mid-1950s before a program of business administration was offered in the Department of Economics.<ref name = "ogsmhist">Madison Smartt Bell, ''History of the Owen School: From Its Early Origins to 1984'' (Nashville: Vanderbilt University, 1985)</ref> With the economic growth in [[Nashville]] and Middle [[Tennessee]] at that time, local businessmen, many of whom were Vanderbilt alumni and BOT members, recognized the need for a formal business education program to train leaders for the area. They were concerned that too many aspiring young businessmen would attend schools in other parts of the country and then remain in those regions.

Progress was slow in seeing the need fulfilled; the idea was conceived during the administration of Chancellor [[Harvie Branscomb]] (1946–63) but did not come to fruition until the administration of Chancellor [[G. Alexander Heard]] (1963–82). The BOT passed the school's founding resolution on May 5, 1967, and operations as the Graduate School of Management began in September 1969 with twelve faculty members and six students.<ref name = "ogsmhist" /> Classes met in a renovated funeral home, a gift from Mr. and Mrs. [[David K. Wilson]]; he was one of those concerned Nashville businessmen, a Vanderbilt alum (’41), and a Vanderbilt BOT member.<ref>Paul Conkin, ''Gone with the Ivy: A Biography of Vanderbilt University'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1985)</ref> The building was named Alexander Hall in honor of Henry Clay Alexander, a Vanderbilt alum (’23), a Vanderbilt BOT member, and president of [[J.P. Morgan]].<ref>Robert A. McGaw, ''The Vanderbilt Campus: A Pictorial History'' (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1978)</ref>

The first dean, [[Igor Ansoff]], held master's degrees in engineering and in mathematics and physics from the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]]; his PhD from [[Brown University]] was in applied mathematics. He had most recently been a professor of industrial administration at [[Carnegie-Mellon]] but previously worked at [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], where his specialty was strategies of diversification. He had also written and published works on business education and business management.<ref name="ogsmhist" />

It was under the leadership of Dean Samuel B. Richmond, a statistician from [[Columbia University]], who had been acting dean of Columbia Graduate School, that the school was named for [[Ralph Owen|Ralph and Lulu Owen]] (1977). In 1930, two years after graduating from Vanderbilt University, Ralph Owen became a founding member of Equitable Securities Corporation in Nashville. By 1950, the firm was recognized as the second largest investment banking firm in the United States. Equitable purchased controlling interest in American Express in 1949 and 1950, and Owen became American Express chairman (1960–68).<ref>Editorial, ''Nashville Banner.'' 1983-11-7.</ref> Following the deaths of both Mr. and Mrs. Owen, their estates gave $33.5 million to The Owen School, said to be the largest gift to a U.S. business school at that time. That sum raised the total of their gifts to more than $62 million.<ref>Julie Bell, “$33.5 Million Given VU for Owen School,” ''Tennessean.'' 1996-1-25.</ref>

The Owen School outgrew Alexander Hall, and its new home was completed in 1982. Management Hall is connected to a historic building, Mechanical Engineering Hall, which encloses a central courtyard and serves as home to the Executive MBA program. Mechanical, built in 1888, was the first building in Tennessee designed for the teaching of engineering.<ref>Vanderbilt University. http://www.vanderbilt.edu/map/owen.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020330221613/http://www.vanderbilt.edu/map/owen.html# |date=2002-03-30 }}.</ref>

In July 2013, [[M. Eric Johnson]] started his tenure as the Ralph Owen Dean and Bruce D. Henderson Professor of Strategy. Johnson previously served as Associate Dean for the MBA program at Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business, where he was also Faculty Director of the Glassmeyer/McNamee Center for Digital Strategies and Benjamin Ames Kimball Professor of the Sciences of Administration. He began his academic career at Vanderbilt's Owen Graduate School of Management, where he taught from 1991 to 1999. One of the youngest professors to receive tenure in the school's history, Johnson twice won the Dean's Teaching Excellence Award while at Owen.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.owen.vanderbilt.edu/vanderbilt/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/faculty-profile.cfm?id=273# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826085041/http://www.owen.vanderbilt.edu/vanderbilt/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/faculty-profile.cfm?id=273# |archive-date=2013-08-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

From the beginning of the planning for what became The Owen School, the goal was to create a graduate business school of “the highest professional quality” with a two-year program leading to an MBA.<ref name = "ogsmhist" /> Most students in the early years were young men from Tennessee and surrounding states, fulfilling the hopes of businessmen to keep talented people in the area, but by 2008, men and women from across the United States and from international locales had attended The Owen School. At present about 25 percent are international students, and 33 percent are women.<ref name = "mbaprofs" /> Recruiters from American and international companies have sought out the students, and the school has expanded its offerings to specialized master's degrees (in health care, finance, and accountancy), an Executive MBA program, and an Executive Development program.<ref>Owen School. http://www.owen.vanderbilt.eduvanderbilt/Programsexec-ed/index.cfm{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref>

Most students who pursue the [[Executive MBA]] have been working in the business world for some time. Many are corporate executives who want to advance within their companies. Others are entrepreneurs who want to advance their businesses, and still others are professionals who want to become managers rather than practitioners. The program requires 24 months. In 2009, incoming students began following an alternating Saturday schedule and two summer sessions. The change from an alternating Friday/Saturday schedule was made to accommodate students in a challenging economic environment.<ref>Owen School. http://www.owen.vanderbilt.edu/vanderbilt/Programs/emba/emba-faq/index.cfm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119011634/http://www.owen.vanderbilt.edu/vanderbilt/Programs/emba/emba-faq/index.cfm# |date=2009-11-19 }}.</ref> The first EMBA class graduated in the spring of 1980.<ref name = "ogsmhist" />

===Health care programs===
The two available health care programs are designed for business professionals.

====Health Care MBA====
The Health Care MBA got under way in 2005, and Owen students were committed to a curriculum “requiring more health care-specific courses than any other program of its kind in the nation.” <ref>''Reporter.'' Vanderbilt Medical Center. http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/reporter/index.html?ID=425.</ref> In addition to taking courses, students earning the Health Care MBA gain direct experience at the [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]] and local health care companies.
