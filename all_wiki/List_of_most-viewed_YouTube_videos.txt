[[YouTube]] is an American video-sharing website headquartered in [[San Bruno, California]]. Although the most-viewed videos were initially [[viral video]]s, such as "[[Judson Laipply#"Evolution of Dance"|Evolution of Dance]]" and "[[Charlie Bit My Finger]]", the most-viewed videos were increasingly related to [[music videos]]. In fact, since [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[Bad Romance]]" in 2009, every video that has reached the top of the "most-viewed YouTube videos" list has been a music video. Although some of the previously most-viewed videos are no longer listed on the site, reaching the top of the list is still considered a tremendous feat.

In November 2005, a [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] advertisement featuring Brazilian football player [[Ronaldinho]] became the first video to reach one million views.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/03/31/2005-nike-video-featuring-ronaldinho-becomes-first-youtube-film-reach-one-million|title=2005: Nike video featuring Ronaldinho becomes first YouTube film to reach one million views}}</ref>
