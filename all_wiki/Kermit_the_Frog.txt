'''Kermit the Frog''' is a [[The Muppets|Muppet]] character created and originally performed by [[Jim Henson]]. Introduced in 1955, Kermit serves as the [[straight man]] [[protagonist]] of numerous Muppet productions, most notably ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', as well as in other television series, feature films, specials, and public service announcements through the years. 

Henson performed Kermit until his death in 1990; [[Steve Whitmire]] performed Kermit from that time until his dismissal in 2016. Kermit is currently performed by [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]].<ref name="VogelFrog">{{Cite news|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/longtime-kermit-frog-voice-actor-replaced-27-years-1019780|title=Longtime Kermit the Frog Voice Actor Replaced After 27 Years|last=Parker|first=Ryan|date=July 10, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=July 10, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712063608/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/longtime-kermit-frog-voice-actor-replaced-27-years-1019780|archive-date=July 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> He was also voiced by [[Frank Welker]] in ''[[Muppet Babies (1984 TV series)|Muppet Babies]]'' and occasionally in other animation projects, and is voiced by [[Matt Danner]] in the 2018 reboot of ''[[Muppet Babies (2018 TV series)|Muppet Babies]]''.

Kermit performed the hit singles "[[Bein' Green]]" in 1970 and "[[Rainbow Connection]]" in 1979 for ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'', the first feature-length film featuring the Muppets. "Rainbow Connection" reached No. 25 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Kermit's iconic look and voice have been recognizable in [[popular culture]] worldwide since, and in 2006, the character was credited as the author of ''[[Before You Leap|Before You Leap: A Frog's Eye View of Life's Greatest Lessons]]'', an "autobiography" told from the perspective of the character himself.

==History and development==
Kermit the Frog first appeared on May 9, 1955, in the premiere of [[WRC-TV]]'s ''[[Sam and Friends]]''.<ref name="Siemaszko"/> This prototype Kermit was created from a discarded turquoise spring coat belonging to Jim Henson's mother and two [[ping pong ball]] halves for eyes.<ref name=Zongker>{{cite news |title=Original Kermit the Frog donated to Smithsonian |first1=Brett |last1=Zongker |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2010-08-25-kermit-smithsonian_N.htm?csp=34 |work=USA Today |date=August 25, 2010 |access-date=March 11, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313211619/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2010-08-25-kermit-smithsonian_N.htm?csp=34 |archive-date=March 13, 2014  }}</ref>

Initially, Kermit was a vague [[lizard]]-like creature. He subsequently made a number of television appearances before his status as a [[frog]] was established. His triangular-pointed collar was added at the time to make him seem more frog-like and to conceal the seam between his head and body.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Feldmar|first1=Jamie|title=Muppets Scandal: Kermit Was Once...A Lizard!|url=http://gothamist.com/2011/04/19/kermit_the_lizard.php|website=Gothamist|publisher=Gothamist, LLC|access-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126051756/http://gothamist.com/2011/04/19/kermit_the_lizard.php|archive-date=January 26, 2016}}</ref> According to [[Michael K.

===Naming===
The origin of Kermit's name is a subject of some debate. It is often claimed that Kermit was named after Henson's childhood friend [[Kermit Scott]], from [[Leland, Mississippi]].<ref name=ddt>{{cite news|first=Terri|last=Ferguson|title=Man for whom frog was named dies |url=http://www.ddtonline.com/articles/2008/06/15/news/news4.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703084438/http://www.ddtonline.com/articles/2008/06/15/news/news4.txt |archive-date=July 3, 2012 |work= Delta Democrat Times|date=June 14, 2008 |access-date=June 15, 2008}}</ref><ref name=usatoday>{{cite news|first=Kathy|last=Hanrahan|title=It's easy being green in Leland, Miss.|url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2007-07-16-kermit_N.htm|work=USA Today|date=July 16, 2007|access-date=June 15, 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504055347/http://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2007-07-16-kermit_N.htm|archive-date=May 4, 2008}}</ref> However, Karen Falk, head archivist and board of directors member for the Jim Henson Legacy organization, denies this claim on the [[Jim Henson Company]]'s website: {{quote|While Jim Henson did have a childhood acquaintance named Kermit, it was not an uncommon name at the time, and Jim always said that the Frog was '''not''' named after this child from his elementary school.<ref name=hensoncom>{{cite web|url= http://www.henson.com/ask/ask_archives_body.html|title= Ask Henson #73|last= Falk|first= Karen|publisher= The Jim Henson Company |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001003125242/http://www.henson.com/ask/ask_archives_body.html |archive-date=October 3, 2000}}</ref>}}

Joy DiMenna, the only daughter of Kermit Kalman Cohen who worked as a sound engineer at [[WBAL-TV]] during Jim Henson's time with ''Sam and Friends'', recalls that the puppet was named after her father. According to Kermit Cohen's obituary, as well as DiMenna and Lenny Levin, a colleague of Mr. Cohen's at WBAL:
{{quote|The late puppeteer had been the host of a show, "Sam and Friends", at WRC-TV in Washington when he was invited to tour WBAL's studios. Both were NBC affiliates then, and WBAL carried the show, Mr. Levin said.

Mr. Henson was introduced to members of the sound and camera crew, including Mr. Cohen.

"When he heard his name, Jim turned around, snapped his fingers and said to his wife, 'That's what we call the frog – Kermit.'<ref name=baltimoresun>{{cite news|url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-09-26/news/1994269068_1_kermit-the-frog-green-frog-wbal|title= Kermit Kalman Cohen, 71, gave Muppet frog his name|last= Zeller|first= Karen|newspaper= [[Baltimore Sun]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121129062917/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-09-26/news/1994269068_1_kermit-the-frog-green-frog-wbal|archive-date= November 29, 2012|url-status= live|df= mdy-all}}</ref>}}

Another common belief is that Kermit was named for [[Kermit Love]], who worked with Henson in designing and constructing Muppets, particularly on ''Sesame Street'' but Love's association with Henson did not begin until well after Kermit's creation and naming, and he always denied any connection between his name and that of the character.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2008-06-25-478449965_x.htm|title=Big Bird costume creator Kermit Love dies at 91|work=USA Today|date=June 25, 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201073805/http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2008-06-25-478449965_x.htm|archive-date=December 1, 2008}}</ref>

As ''Sesame Street'' is localized for some different markets that speak languages other than English, Kermit is often renamed. In [[Portugal]], he is called ''Cocas, o Sapo'' (''sapo'' means "[[toad]]"), and in [[Brazil]], his name is similar: ''Caco, o Sapo''. In most of Hispanic America, his name is ''la rana René'' (''René the Frog''), while in Spain, he is named ''Gustavo''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/10/28/kermit-the-frog-offers-his-sincere-apologies-to-latin-america-but/ |title=Kermit The Frog Offers His Sincere Apologies To Latin America, But... |work=[[Bleeding Cool]] |date=October 28, 2011 |access-date=July 15, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423113912/http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/10/28/kermit-the-frog-offers-his-sincere-apologies-to-latin-america-but/ |archive-date=April 23, 2015  }}</ref> In the Arabic version, he is known as ''Kamel'', which is a common Arabic male name that means "perfect".

===Character biography===
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlJM4UhbQ7A Yay! Kermit Arm Flail], Disney UK}}

A biography has been developed for Kermit the Frog as if he was an actual living performer rather than a puppet character. According to this fictional biography, he was born in [[Leland, Mississippi]], alongside approximately 2,353 siblings,<ref name=MuppetBook/> though a 2011 "interview" on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' has him state that he was from the swamps of [[Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_AUn5poOmA|title=Ellen Meets Kermit!|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122090232/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_AUn5poOmA|archive-date=November 22, 2016}}</ref>

As portrayed in the 2002 film ''Kermit's Swamp Years'', at the age of 12, he was the first of his siblings to leave the swamp, and one of the first frogs to talk to humans. He is shown in the film encountering a 12-year-old Jim Henson (played by Christian Kriebel) for the first time.

According to ''[[The Muppet Movie]],'' Kermit returned to the swamp, where a passing agent ([[Dom DeLuise]]) noted he had talent and, thus inspired, he headed to Hollywood, encountering the rest of the Muppets along the way. Together, they were given a standard "rich and famous" contract by Lew Lord ([[Orson Welles]]) of Wide World Studios and began their showbiz careers. In ''[[Before You Leap]]'', Kermit again references encountering Jim Henson sometime after the events depicted in the course of ''The Muppet Movie'' and details their friendship and their partnership in the entertainment industry, crediting Henson as being the individual to whom he owes his fame. At some point after the events of ''The Muppet Movie'', Kermit and the other Muppets begin ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', and the characters remain together as a group, before starring in the other Muppet films and ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'', with Kermit usually at the core of the stories as the lead protagonist. Kermit is shown in ''The Muppet Movie'' as stating that the events of the film are "approximately how it happened" when asked by his nephew Robin about how the Muppets got started.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dale |first1=Timothy |last2=Foy |first2=Joseph |title=Jim Henson and Philosophy: Imagination and the Magic of Mayhem |date=2015 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1442246652 |page=240}}</ref>

==Career==
[[Image:Tv sam and friends.jpg|thumb|Kermit's earliest incarnation on ''[[Sam and Friends]]'']]
Kermit has been featured prominently on both ''The Muppet Show'' and ''Sesame Street''.<ref name="Kurin">{{cite book |last=Kurin |first=Richard |title=The Smithsonian's History of America in 101 Objects |publisher=Penguin |date=2013 |isbn=978-1101638774 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8z5-QyVvKsC&q=%22Kermit%22+%22sesame+street%22+-wikipedia&pg=PT582 |via=[[Google Books]] |access-date=July 15, 2017 }}</ref> However, he had a prominent career before ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s debut in 1969, as he starred in ''[[Sam and Friends]]'', and numerous Muppets made guest appearances on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' from 1961 and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' from 1966.<ref>{{cite book |last=Prince |first=Julie |chapter=Muppet Show, The |title=Encyclopedia of Television |date=2014 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1135194727 |page=1554}}</ref>

===''Sesame Street''===
Kermit was one of the original main Muppet characters on ''[[Sesame Street]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Toerpe |first=Kathleen D. |chapter=Jim Henson Productions and the Muppets |title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture |year=2001 |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=0879728213 |page=442}}</ref> Closely identified with the show, Kermit usually appeared as a lecturer on simple topics, a straight man to another Muppet [[Foil (fiction)|foil]] (usually [[Grover]], [[Herry Monster]] or [[Cookie Monster]]), or a news reporter interviewing storybook characters for Sesame Street News.<ref name="Kurin"/> He sang many songs on the show, including "[[Bein' Green]]",<ref name="Kurin"/> and appeared in the 1998 video ''The Best of Kermit on Sesame Street''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sesame Street – The Best of Kermit the Frog|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sesame_street_the_best_of_kermit_the_frog/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|access-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312221119/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sesame_street_the_best_of_kermit_the_frog/|archive-date=March 12, 2016}}</ref>

Unlike the rest of the show's Muppets, Kermit was never any property of [[Sesame Workshop]] and has rarely been a part of the show's merchandise. When Sesame Workshop bought full ownership of its characters from The Jim Henson Company for $180&nbsp;million, Kermit was excluded from the deal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/disney-muppets-article-1.496946 |title=Disney Goes After Muppets |work=[[New York Daily News]] |date=December 20, 2002 |access-date=July 15, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716170743/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/disney-muppets-article-1.496946 |archive-date=July 16, 2017  }}</ref> The character now belongs to The Muppets Studio, a division of [[The Walt Disney Company]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/business/10muppets.html |title=It's Time for Your Face-Lift, Miss Piggy |work=[[The New York Times]] |last1=Cieply |first1=Michael |last2=Barnes |first2=Brooks |date=April 9, 2011 |access-date=July 15, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107091513/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/business/10muppets.html |archive-date=November 7, 2016  }}</ref> His first ''Sesame Street'' appearance since Disney ownership was in an ''[[Elmo's World]]'' segment in the show's 40th-season premiere on November 10, 2009. His most recent appearance was in the 2019 television special ''[[Sesame Street's 50th Anniversary Celebration]]'', where he performed "Bein' Green" with [[Elvis Costello]].

===With the Muppets===
In ''The Muppet Show'' television series, Kermit was the central character, the [[showrunner]], and the long-suffering [[Stage management|stage manager]] of the theater show, trying to keep order amidst the chaos created by the other Muppets. Henson once claimed that Kermit's job on the ''Muppet Show'' was much like his own: "trying to get a bunch of crazies to actually get the job done."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2012/03/14/voodoo-comedy-playhouse-brings-laughs-to-denvers-lodo-district/|title=Voodoo Comedy Playhouse brings laughs to Denver's LoDo district – The Denver Post|newspaper=The Denver Post|first1=John|last1=Wenzel|date=March 14, 2012|access-date=July 17, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817221219/http://www.denverpost.com/2012/03/14/voodoo-comedy-playhouse-brings-laughs-to-denvers-lodo-district/|archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> It was on this show that the [[running gag]] of Kermit being pursued by leading lady [[Miss Piggy]] developed.<ref name="Siemaszko"/>

On ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'', Kermit was still a main character, although he was the producer rather than frontman. He appeared in many parody sketches such as ''NYPD Green'', ''City Schtickers'', ''Flippers'', and ''The Muppet Odd Squad'', as well as in the ''Psychiatrist's Office'' sketch.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-kermit-muppets-career-pictures-photogallery.html |title=Muppets Tonight (1996) |author1=Emily Christianson |author2=Noelene Clark |author3=Nate Jackson |author4=Todd Martens |author5=Jevon Phillips |author6=Nardine Saad |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2017 |access-date=June 15, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603222333/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-kermit-muppets-career-pictures-photogallery.html |archive-date=June 3, 2016  }}</ref>

The other is named after [[Miss Piggy]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tbo.com/list/military-news/noaa-hurricane-hunters-to-get-35-million-overhaul-20140814/|title=MacDill hurricane hunters to get $35&nbsp;million overhaul|last=Altman|first=Howard|date=August 14, 2014|work=The Tampa Tribune|access-date=May 6, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603103008/http://www.tbo.com/list/military-news/noaa-hurricane-hunters-to-get-35-million-overhaul-20140814/|archive-date=June 3, 2016}}</ref> In 2015, the discovery of the Costa Rican [[glass frog]] ''[[Hyalinobatrachium dianae]]'' also attracted [[Viral phenomenon|viral]] media attention due to the creature's perceived resemblance to Kermit, with researcher Brian Kubicki quoted as saying "I am glad that this species has ended up getting so much international attention, and in doing so it is highlighting the amazing amphibians that are native to Costa Rica and the need to continue exploring and studying the country's amazing tropical forests".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/50548-kermit-the-frog-look-alike-discovered.html|title=Kermit the Frog Look-Alike Discovered in Costa Rica|first1=Megan|last1=Gannon|publisher=LiveScience|date=April 22, 2015|access-date=July 17, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160711183052/http://www.livescience.com/50548-kermit-the-frog-look-alike-discovered.html|archive-date=July 11, 2016}}</ref>

A still photo of Kermit sitting in his Director's chair with his megaphone in his hand from ''The Muppet Show'' appeared on a technical difficulties [[telop]] graphic on [[Metromedia]] owned-and-operated station [[KTTV]] Channel 11 in [[Los Angeles]] during the late 1970's and early 1980's.

As an [[April Fool's Day|April Fool's]] joke, Kermit hosted [[CNN]]'s ''[[Larry King Live]]'' in 1994 and interviewed [[Hulk Hogan]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/1994-kermit-frog-filled-host-cnns-larry-king-live-236606|title=In 1994, Kermit The Frog filled in as host of CNN's Larry King Live|last=Blevins|first=Joe|date=May 11, 2016|newspaper=[[The A.V.

===Merchandising===
Jim Henson's characters, including the Muppets, have inspired merchandise internationally, with Chris Bensch, chief curator of [[Rochester, New York]]'s [[The Strong National Museum of Play]], reporting "There seems to have been a particular craze for Kermit the Frog in [[Japan]]," likely due to the "[[cuteness]] appeal".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2016/03/11/henson-family-triggers-muppet-outbreak-strong/81638918/|first1=Jeff|last1=Spevak|date=March 11, 2016|access-date=July 27, 2016|title=Henson family triggers Muppet outbreak at The Strong|newspaper=Democrat and Chronicle}}</ref> Baby Kermit [[plush toys]] became popular in the 1980s after the success of ''[[Muppet Babies (1984 TV series)|Muppet Babies]].''<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bellomo|first1=Mark|title=Totally Tubular '80s Toys|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=978-1440216473|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CF8AjVJXvH0C&q=kermit|language=en|date=September 15, 2010}}</ref> In 1991, one year after Jim Henson died, merchandise featuring Kermit and other Muppet characters was being sold at Disney theme parks, causing [[The Jim Henson Company|Henson Associates]] to file a lawsuit against Disney for [[copyright infringement]]. Henson alleged that the "counterfeit merchandise" falsely indicated that the characters belonged to Disney, although the latter company had the right to exercise use of the characters due to an earlier [[licensing]] agreement.<ref name=DisneyLicense/> The Henson Associates highlighted a [[T-shirt]] displaying Kermit, the Disney brand, and a [[copyright symbol]]. Disney representative Erwin Okun said the lawsuit was "outrageous" and "an unfortunate break with the legacy of a fine relationship with Disney that Jim Henson left behind".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/18/business/the-media-business-kermit-the-frog-in-new-role-plaintiff.html|title=Kermit the Frog in New Role: Plaintiff|access-date=July 26, 2016|date=April 18, 1991|work=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819063343/http://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/18/business/the-media-business-kermit-the-frog-in-new-role-plaintiff.html|archive-date=August 19, 2016}}</ref> Disney later acquired the Muppets, and thusly, clothes, toys and souvenirs depicting Kermit and the Muppets continued to be sold at Disney theme parks and stores.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Guides|first1=Birnbaum|title=Birnbaum's Disneyland 2012|publisher=Disney Electronic Content|isbn=9781423166238|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-osm5QFoYsC&q=kermit&pg=PA72|language=en|date=January 17, 2012}}</ref>

===Kermit in Internet culture===
In March 2007, ''Sad Kermit'', an unofficial parody, was uploaded to the website [[YouTube]], showing a store-bought Kermit puppet performing a version of the [[Nine Inch Nails]] song "[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]" in a style similar to [[Johnny Cash]]'s famous cover version. In contrast to the real Kermit character's usual family-friendly antics, the video shows the puppet engaging in [[drug abuse]], smoking, [[alcoholism]], performing [[oral sex]] on [[Rowlf the Dog]], smashing a picture of Miss Piggy (with a breast exposed) and [[suicide attempt|attempting suicide]]. The video became an [[Internet meme]]. The ''[[Victoria Times Colonist]]'' called it an "online sensation".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=52be4b53-0258-4c68-b8e3-a1b0538e5718&k=56381 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209001427/http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=52be4b53-0258-4c68-b8e3-a1b0538e5718&k=56381 |archive-date=December 9, 2007 |title='Sad Kermit' bares his soul online |date=December 9, 2007 |newspaper=Times Colonist |url-status=dead}}</ref> The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said it "puts the high in 'Hi-ho!'"<ref>{{cite news |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043245/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/328027%2CCST-FTR-tube05.article |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |first1=Misha |last1=Davenport |title=Parody video puts the high in 'Hi-ho!' :: CHICAGO SUN-TIMES :: Entertainment |date=September 30, 2007 |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/328027,CST-FTR-tube05.article |url-status=dead}}</ref> The ''[[London Free Press]]'' said "Sad Kermit is in a world of pain".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/Today/Columnists/Brown_Dan/2007/04/12/3992555.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070929100009/http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/Today/Columnists/Brown_Dan/2007/04/12/3992555.html |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |title=Sad Kermit is hurting |date=April 12, 2007 |work=[[The London Free Press]] |last=Brown |first=Dan |url-status=dead}}</ref> The ''[[Houston Press]]'' described it as the "world's most revolting web phenomenon".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/music/the-sad-kermit-video-6575062|title=The Sad Kermit Video|first=Ben|last=Westhoff|date=May 24, 2007|newspaper=Houston Press|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914130046/http://www.houstonpress.com/music/the-sad-kermit-video-6575062|archive-date=September 14, 2016}}</ref> [[SF Weekly]] described the unauthorized video as "ironic slandering".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/its-so-easy-being-green-jim-hensons-lasting-music-legacy/Content?oid=2163091|title=It's so easy being green: Jim Henson's lasting music legacy|first=Jennifer|last=Maerz|newspaper=SF Weekly|date=June 20, 2007|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917155152/http://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/its-so-easy-being-green-jim-hensons-lasting-music-legacy/Content?oid=2163091|archive-date=September 17, 2016}}</ref> Clips have been featured on the Canadian television series ''[[George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight|The Hour]]'', where host [[George Stroumboulopoulos]] speculated that the Kermit version of "Hurt" was inspired by the Cash version rather than that of Nine Inch Nails.<ref>{{cite episode |series=[[George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight|The Hour]] |first1=George |last1=Stroumboulopoulos |network=[[CBC Television]] |date=April 4, 2007}}</ref>

Kermit has also appeared in a popular meme in which he is shown sipping tea, "one used when you sassily point something out, and then slyly back away, claiming that it's not [your] business".<ref name="Browne">{{cite magazine|url=https://nymag.com/selectall/2016/06/the-real-reason-gmas-tea-lizard-tweet-was-problematic.html|title=The Real Reason GMA's 'Tea Lizard' Tweet Was Problematic|magazine=New York Magazine|first1=Rembert|last1=Browne|author-link=Rembert Browne|date=June 21, 2016|access-date=July 13, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624035820/http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/06/the-real-reason-gmas-tea-lizard-tweet-was-problematic.html|archive-date=June 24, 2016}}</ref> The photo is taken from "Be More Kermit," a [[Lipton]] advertisement that aired in 2014, and was adapted into the "But That's None of My Business" meme by African American comedians on the [[Tumblr]] blog Kermit the Snitch, making appearances on [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]]<ref name="Fusion">{{cite web|url=http://fusion.net/story/316936/tea-lizard/|title='Good Morning America' calling a popular Kermit the Frog meme 'Tea Lizard' whitewashes its origin|publisher=Fusion|date=June 21, 2016|access-date=July 17, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713091000/http://fusion.net/story/316936/tea-lizard/|archive-date=July 13, 2016}}</ref> and [[Facebook]].<ref name="Bustle">{{cite web|last1=Hayes|first1=Stephanie|title=#Kermit the Frog #ButThatsNoneofMyBusinessTho Memes Are Annoyingly Taking Over the Internet|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/29201-kermit-the-frog-butthatsnoneofmybusinesstho-memes-are-annoyingly-taking-over-the-internet|website=www.bustle.com|date=June 24, 2014|access-date=July 17, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720061532/http://www.bustle.com/articles/29201-kermit-the-frog-butthatsnoneofmybusinesstho-memes-are-annoyingly-taking-over-the-internet|archive-date=July 20, 2016}}</ref> Charles Pulliam-Moore of the TV station ''[[Fusion (TV channel)|Fusion]]'' praised "But That's None of My Business" as "a symbol for the comedic brilliance born out of black communities on the internet,"<ref name="Fusion"/> but Stephanie Hayes of ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'' magazine criticized the memes as racist and obscene.<ref name="Bustle"/>

In 2016, a ''[[Good Morning America]]'' post on Twitter referred to "But That's None of My Business" as "Tea Lizard," becoming the subject of viral online derision. ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine replied that, "Kermit is a frog. A frog is an amphibian. A lizard is a reptile. It's just so insulting. Beyond a frog and a lizard both being clearly [[ectotherm]]ic, they couldn't be any more different. Not all green things are the same, you ignorant bastards".<ref name="Browne"/> ''[[Popular Science]]'' also addressed the misnomer, writing "Frogs, which are amphibians, have quite a few significant differences from reptiles in how they breathe, their life cycles, whether they have scales or not... there's a lot to absorb here".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.popsci.com/why-tealizard-kermit-frog-is-not-lizard|title=Why #TeaLizard Kermit The Frog Is Not a Lizard|magazine=Popular Science|first1=G.

In November 2016, a new meme surfaced of Kermit talking to a hooded version of himself which represents the self and its dark inner thoughts. It involves captioning of a [[screenshot]] taken from the ''Muppets Most Wanted'' movie of Kermit and [[Constantine (Muppet)|Constantine]] looking at each other.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.avclub.com/article/evil-kermit-shithead-inside-us-all-246020 |title=Evil Kermit is the shithead inside us all |last1=Purdom |first1=Clayton |date=November 16, 2016 |access-date=December 5, 2016 |newspaper=[[The A.V.
