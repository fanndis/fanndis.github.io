The Museum was founded by [[Robert J. Ulrich]], former CEO and chairman of [[Target Corporation]]. A collector of African art and a world museum enthusiast, Ulrich and his friend Marc Felix originated the idea after a visit to the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Musical Instrument Museum]] in [[Brussels, Belgium]]. The design of the museum benefited as well from the consultation of the [[Cité de la Musique#Musée de la Musique|Musée de la Musique]] in [[Paris]] modernised in 1997.<ref>[http://www.mimo-international.com/MIMO/museums.aspx Presentation of the Musée de la Musique on the online database MIMO of musical instruments museums] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160907043237/http://www.mimo-international.com/MIMO/museums.aspx |date=2016-09-07 }}, website mimo-international. com</ref>

The contemporary building covers approximately 200,000 square-feet, with two floors of galleries. The museum was built at a cost of over {{US$|250 million}}. The exhibit for each country features a flat-screen high-resolution video showing local musicians performing on native instruments. Visitors can listen to the performances through a wireless device with headphones that is activated automatically when an exhibit is being observed.

The facility contains a 299-seat theater for concerts, which are held primarily after regular hours. [[Joshua Bell]] recorded his album "French Impressions" in the theater in 2011.<ref>http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2012/01/french-impressions-is-first-album-recorded-in-music-instrument-museum-.html</ref> There is also a cafe with both indoor and outdoor seating.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themim.org/pdf/Press/MIM_Press_Release-Post_Grand_Opening.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009062356/http://www.themim.org/pdf/Press/MIM_Press_Release-Post_Grand_Opening.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-09 }} Museum press release, April 24, 2010</ref>
