== Stated aims and principles ==
{{Only primary sources|section|date=June 2020}}
=== Aims ===
Extinction Rebellion's website, at the time of the group's inception in the UK, stated the following aims:<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-48607989|title=Who are Extinction Rebellion and what do they want?|date=16 July 2019|access-date=9 August 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|access-date=18 November 2018|title=Extinction Rebellion|url=https://rebellion.earth/|website=Rebellion.earth}}</ref>

# Government must tell the truth by declaring a [[Climate emergency declaration|climate and ecological emergency]], working with other institutions to communicate the urgency for change.
# Government must act now to halt [[biodiversity loss]] and reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]] to net-zero by 2025.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/2050-is-too-late-we-must-drastically-cut-emissions-much-sooner-121512|title=2050 is too late – we must drastically cut emissions much sooner|last=Jackson|first=Tim|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=23 September 2019}}</ref>
# Government must create, and be led by the decisions of, a [[citizens' assembly]] on climate and ecological justice.

When the movement expanded to the [[United States]], a further demand was added to that group's list: ''"We demand a just transition that prioritizes the most vulnerable people and indigenous sovereignty; establishes reparations and remediation led by and for Black people, Indigenous people, people of colour and poor communities for years of environmental injustice, establishes legal rights for ecosystems to thrive and regenerate in perpetuity, and repairs the effects of ongoing ecocide to prevent extinction of human and all species, in order to maintain a livable, just planet for all."''<ref name="guardian-gayle-4-oct-19">{{cite news|first1=Damien|last1=Gayle|access-date=5 October 2019|title=Does Extinction Rebellion have a race problem?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/04/extinction-rebellion-race-climate-crisis-inequality|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 October 2019|issn=0261-3077|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|access-date=5 October 2019|title=Demands|url=https://extinctionrebellion.us/demands|website=Extinction Rebellion US}}</ref>

=== Principles ===
XR states the following on its website and explains the following in its declaration:<ref name=declaration/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://rebellion.earth/the-truth/about-us/ |title=About Us|website=Extinction Rebellion|access-date= 13 April 2019}}</ref>
# "We have a shared vision of change—creating a world that is fit for generations to come.
# We set our mission on what is necessary—mobilising 3.5% of the population to achieve system change by using ideas such as "momentum-driven organising" to achieve this.
# We need a regenerative culture—creating a culture that is healthy, resilient, and adaptable.
# We openly challenge ourselves and this toxic system, leaving our comfort zones to take action for change.
# We value reflecting and learning, following a cycle of action, reflection, learning, and planning for more action (learning from other movements and contexts as well as our own experiences).
# We welcome everyone and every part of everyone—working actively to create safer and more accessible spaces.
# We actively mitigate for power—breaking down hierarchies of power for more equitable participation.
# We avoid blaming and shaming—we live in a toxic system, but no one individual is to blame.
# We are a non-violent network using non-violent strategy and tactics as the most effective way to bring about change.
# We are based on autonomy and decentralisation—we collectively create the structures we need to challenge power. Anyone who follows these core principles and values can take action in the name of Extinction Rebellion."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rebellion.earth/who-we-are/|title=Who We Are {{!}} Extinction Rebellion|website=Rebellion.earth|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref>

=== Organisation and roles ===

Extinction Rebellion has a decentralised structure. Providing that they respect the 'principles and values', every local group can organise events and actions independently. To organise the movement, local groups are structured with various 'working groups' taking care of strategy, outreach, well-being, etc.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

In a statement, XR said the action was designed to disrupt and expose what it called a failure to adequately report on the climate emergency: "Our free press, society and democracy is under attack – from a failing government that lies to us consistently … Our leaders have allowed the majority of our media to be amassed in the hands of five people with powerful vested interests and deep connections to fossil fuel industries.

They supported the school strike movement and Extinction Rebellion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/doctors-call-for-nonviolent-direct-action-over-climate-crisis |title=Doctors call for nonviolent direct action over climate crisis |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Matthew Taylor|date= 27 June 2019}}</ref>

== Criticism ==
=== Diversity ===
Ben Smoke, one of the [[Stansted 15]], writing in ''The Guardian,'' criticised XR's tactic of mass arrest. He wrote for XR to casually speak of imprisonment undermines the negative experiences of incarceration on black, Asian and minority ethnic people in the UK. He also wrote that for XR to be supporting peoples' court cases risks drawing significant "resources, time, money and energy" from the environmental movement, from the individuals involved, and which could otherwise be directed towards people most affected by climate change. Smoke instead recommended tactics that are not only the preserve of those able to afford the expense and time of arrest. He also wrote that though mass arrests may be intended to cause government to focus more on tackling climate change, it might instead cause government to increase anti-protest legislation.<ref name="guardian-smoke"/>

The critique of XR's middle class [[white privilege]], that its mass arrest tactic does not consider that people of colour will not be treated as leniently by the system as white people, was also highlighted in an open letter from [[Wretched of the Earth]], an environmental group that focuses on black, brown and indigenous voices, to XR.<ref name="guardian-gayle-4-oct-19"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Garavito|first1=Tatiana|last2=Thanki|first2=Nathan|access-date=22 September 2019 |title=Stop Asking People of Color to Get Arrested to Protest Climate Change |url= https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbm3q4/extinction-rebellion-xr-is-shaped-by-middle-class-white-people-it-does-not-serve-people-of-color |date=18 September 2019}}</ref> The group responded to this critique with a thank you, pointing out their solidarity and commitment to diversity of membership as well diversity in styles of engagement (for example, one does not need to volunteer for a prison term in order to be an active member of XR).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/XRBristol/posts/896006247410515|title=Extinction Rebellion Bristol|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=11 January 2020}}</ref>    

Some in Extinction Rebellion have also called attention to Martin Luther King Jr. (one of XR's guiding inspirations) in this regard, noting that his call for civil disobedience to end segregation was a call directed toward all who were willing and able, regardless of race or colour.

When the movement expanded to the US, a fourth demand was added to that group's list of demands: for a "just transition that prioritises the most vulnerable and indigenous sovereignty [and] establishes reparations and remediation led by and for black people, indigenous people, people of colour and poor communities for years of environmental injustice."<ref name="guardian-gayle-4-oct-19"/>

=== Class ===
Karen Bell, senior lecturer in human geography and environmental justice at the University of West of England, Bristol, wrote in ''The Guardian'' that environmental groups such as Extinction Rebellion are not strongly rooted in working-class organisations and communities, which she said is a problem because building the broad-based support necessary for a radical transition to sustainability requires contributions from all strands of environmentalism, especially working class.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Karen|last1=Bell|access-date=13 October 2019|title=A working-class green movement is out there but not getting the credit it deserves|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/11/a-working-class-green-movement-is-out-there-but-not-getting-the-credit-it-deserves|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 October 2019|issn=0261-3077|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>      Labour Party shadow cabinet member Lisa Nandy criticised the organisation in The Guardian in October 2019, saying "calls for individual action can't just be modelled on the lifestyles of middle class city dwellers".  

[[George Monbiot]] has also written in ''The Guardian'' that "Extinction Rebellion is too white, and too middle class."<ref name="guardian-monbiot-16-oct-19" />  The Canning town protest ([[Extinction Rebellion#"International Rebellion"|above]]) focussed attention on class issues and led to an apology from an XR spokesman.<ref name="Dazed1">{{cite web|last1=Dazed|access-date=18 October 2019|title=Don't be fooled into thinking that climate activism is just for poshos|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/politics/article/46460/1/extinction-rebellion-climate-change-activism-middle-class-issue|date=17 October 2019|website=Dazed}}</ref><ref name="Hinscliff1" /><ref name="independent1">{{cite web|access-date=18 October 2019|title=Opinion: Extinction Rebellion's treatment of class and race blocks its goal of climate justice|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/extinction-rebellion-climate-crisis-race-class-london-arrests-xr-a9156816.html|date=15 October 2019|website=The Independent}}</ref><ref name="huffpost1">{{cite web|access-date=18 October 2019|title=How Extinction Rebellion Inadvertently Stoked A Class War|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/extinction-rebellion-class_uk_5da87b08e4b0b24e75de6419|date=18 October 2019|website=HuffPost UK}}</ref><ref name="telegraph1">{{cite news|first1=Charlotte|last1=Gill|access-date=18 October 2019|title=Extinction Rebellion have turned climate change into a class war|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/17/extinction-rebellion-have-turned-climate-change-class-war/|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=17 October 2019|issn=0307-1235|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref name="times1">{{cite news|first1=Tom|last1=Ball|first2=Ben|last2=Webster|first3= Esther|last3=Webber|access-date=18 October 2019|title=Extinction Rebellion apologises after commuters drag protester off train|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/commuters-clash-with-extinction-rebellion-climate-protesters-on-london-underground-v25z5gmnn|newspaper=The Times|date=18 October 2019|issn=0140-0460|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}</ref><ref name=tube>{{cite web|access-date=17 October 2019|title=XR admit Tube protest was 'own goal' because it annoyed people|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/extinction-rebellion-admits-rushhour-tube-protest-was-own-goal-because-it-annoyed-commuters-a4263776.html|date=17 October 2019|website=Evening Standard}}</ref>

===Timescale===
According to the [[Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit]], which supports XR's course of strong action and demands, the time frame being urged by XR is "an ambition that technically, economically and politically has absolutely no chance of being fulfilled." It said that one way [[Climate neutrality|to go net zero]] by 2025 would include the scrapping of flying and 38&nbsp;million petrol and diesel cars would need to be removed from the roads. Twenty-six million gas boilers would need to be disconnected in six years.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Simpson |first1=John |last2=Webster |first2=Ben |last3=Humpries |first3=Will |title=Protest police call for re-inforcements |work=The Times |issue=72,824 |date=18 April 2019 |page=9}}</ref> The Rapid Transition Alliance and the [[Centre for Alternative Technology]] are more positive about the date specified.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cat.org.uk/can-we-reach-zero-carbon-by-2025/|title=Can we reach zero carbon by 2025?|date=25 April 2019|website=Centre for Alternative Technology}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47947775|title=Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work?|first=Matt|last=McGrath|date=16 April 2019|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref>

===Alleged extremism===
A report called ''Extremism Rebellion'' by [[Policy Exchange]], a UK-based [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] [[think tank]], said that Extinction Rebellion is an extremist organisation seeking the breakdown of liberal democracy and the rule of law.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://policyexchange.org.uk/publication/extremism-rebellion/|title=Extremism Rebellion|website=Policy Exchange|language=en-GB|access-date=25 December 2019|year=2019}}</ref> In 2019 the [[National Counter Terrorism Policing Network#Regional Counter Terrorism Units|South East Counter Terrorism Unit]] police authority listed Extinction Rebellion, alongside neo-Nazi and Islamist terrorist groups, as a threat in a guide titled "Safeguarding young people and adults from ideological extremism", but recalled and disavowed this guide after media inquiries.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dodd |first1=Vikram |last2=Grierson |first2=Jamie |title=Terrorism police list Extinction Rebellion as extremist ideology |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/10/xr-extinction-rebellion-listed-extremist-ideology-police-prevent-scheme-guidance |access-date=10 January 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=10 January 2020}}</ref>

===Politics and ideology===
Extinction Rebellion's third demand ("Government must create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens’ Assembly on climate and ecological justice") has been summarised by its leadership as a demand to "go beyond politics".<ref>
{{cite web |url=https://extinctionrebellion.uk/the-truth/demands/ |title=Our Demands |author=<!--Not stated-->  |website=Extinction Rebellion UK |access-date=5 September 2020}} </ref> This demand has been criticised by socialists, including individuals who have participated in the movement's action. Writing for ''[[The Independent]]'' in April 2019, Natasha Josette, an anti-racist activist and member of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] for a [[Green New Deal]], critiqued Extinction Rebellion both for marginalising ethnic minorities, and for not recognising "that the climate crisis is the result of neoliberal capitalism, and a global system of extraction, dispossession and oppression".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/extinction-rebellion-arrests-london-protests-climate-change-people-colour-global-south-a8879846.html |title=People of colour are the most impacted by climate change, yet Extinction Rebellion is erasing them from the conversation |last=Josette |first=Natasha |date=21 April 2019 |website=[[independent.co.uk]] |access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref> Also writing for ''The Independent'', Amardeep Dhillon argued that XR's narrow focus on net zero carbon emissions meant that it ignored [[extractivism]] and the threat to the environment posed by companies in the extractive sector using [[greenwashing]] to defend and advance their economic interests, suggesting that XR's position "threatens to give carte blanche to governments and corporations who are happy to shift the burden of climate destruction onto poor and indigenous communities of colour in the global South".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/extinction-rebellion-climate-crisis-bhp-mining-coal-colombia-a9167601.html |title=Extinction Rebellion must decide if it is anti-capitalist – and this greenwashing mining company shows us why |last=Dhillon |first=Amardeep |date=23 October 2019 |website=[[independent.co.uk]] |access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref>

In October 2019, Erica Eisen, an XR participant, wrote an article for ''[[Current Affairs (magazine)|Current Affairs]]'' in which she linked the movement's "beyond politics" slogan not only to the demand for a citizens' assembly but also to a refusal to take stances on issues beyond the environment, in order to gain as broad a base of support as possible, highlighting the movement's ban on organising community groups based on political identity. She argued that "...our current economic system is (not) compatible with continued life on this planet. It is unrealistic and irresponsible to pretend that a proposed climate solution which keeps capitalism intact is any kind of solution at all", and that failing to articulate an anti-capitalist position undermined the movement's credibility by "lend(ing) tacit support" to large companies responsible for environmentally destructive behaviour. She also suggested that failing to embrace leftist positions would give space for far right groups to piggyback and exploit environmentalist rhetoric, citing the examples of the [[Christchurch mosque shootings]] and [[2019 El Paso shooting]], both of whose perpetrators left manifestos which mentioned environmental concerns.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/10/extinction-rebellion-has-a-politics-problem |title=Extinction Rebellion Has a Politics Problem |last=Eisen |first=Erica X |date=11 October 2019 |website=[[Current Affairs (magazine)]] |access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref> Writing for ''[[i-D]]'' in December 2019, Nathalie Olah drew parallels between XR and earlier decentralised protest movements such as the events of [[May 68]] in France and the [[Occupy movement]], suggesting that a shared lack of clarity in concrete demands had stunted the political impact of the latter two movements and arguing that climate change and class politics were "inextricable" as "a small minority are responsible for a high proportion of emissions, and because the poorest stand to face the worst repercussions".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/gyz43y/extinction-rebellion-photography-protest-class-green-climate-crisis |title=What Extinction Rebellion needs to change before we can save the world |last=Olah |first=Nathalie |date=4 December 2019 |website=[[i-D]] |access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref>

==Media coverage==
Analysis of the October 2019 "International Rebellion" indicates that "the movement was mentioned more than 70,000 times in online media reports. Of these, 43.5% of online coverage was in the UK followed by 15.2% from Germany, 14.6 % in Australia and 12.1% in the US."<ref name="guardian-townsend-20-oct-19"/>
