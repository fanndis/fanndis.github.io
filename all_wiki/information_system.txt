'''Information Systems''' is an academic study of systems with a specific reference to information and the complementary networks of hardware and software that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and also distribute [[data (computing)|data]]. An emphasis is placed on an information system having a definitive boundary, users, processors, storage, inputs, outputs and the aforementioned communication networks.<ref>Jessup, Leonard M.; Joseph S.

Some authors make a clear distinction between information systems, [[computer system]]s, and [[business process]]es. Information systems typically include an ICT component but are not purely concerned with ICT, focusing instead on the end-use of [[information technology]]. Information systems are also different from business processes. Information systems help to control the performance of business processes.<ref>O'Brien, J A. (2003).

A work system is a system in which humans or machines perform processes and activities using resources to produce specific products or services for customers. An information system is a work system whose activities are devoted to capturing, transmitting, storing, retrieving, manipulating and displaying information.<ref>Alter, S. (2006) The Work System Method: Connecting People, Processes, and IT for Business Results. Works System Press, CA</ref>

As such, information systems inter-relate with [[data systems]] on the one hand and activity systems on the other. An information system is a form of [[communication]] system in which data represent and are processed as a form of social memory. An information system can also be considered a semi-[[formal language]] which supports human decision making and action.

Information systems are the primary focus of study for [[organizational informatics]].<ref>Beynon-Davies P. (2009). Business Information Systems. Palgrave, Basingstoke</ref>

The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] defines "Information systems specialists [as] focus[ing] on integrating [[information technology]] solutions and business processes to meet the information needs of businesses and other enterprises."<ref name="curricula">The Joint Task Force for Computing Curricula 2005. [http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021153204/http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf |date=2014-10-21 }}</ref>

There are various types of information systems, for example: [[transaction processing system]]s, [[decision support system]]s, [[knowledge management system]]s, [[learning management system]]s, [[database management system]]s, and office information systems. Critical to most information systems are information technologies, which are typically designed to enable humans to perform tasks for which the human brain is not well suited, such as: handling large amounts of information, performing complex calculations, and controlling many simultaneous processes.

Information technologies are a very important and malleable resource available to executives.<ref>Rockart et al. (1996) Eight imperatives for the new IT organization Sloan Management review.</ref> Many companies have created a position of [[chief information officer]] (CIO) that sits on the executive board with the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO), [[chief financial officer]] (CFO), [[chief operating officer]] (COO), and [[chief technical officer]] (CTO). The CTO may also serve as CIO, and vice versa. The [[chief information security officer]] (CISO) focuses on information security management.

The '''six components''' that must come together in order to produce an information system are: (Information systems are organizational procedures and do not need a computer or software, this data is erroneous, i.e., an accounting system in the 1400s using a ledger and ink utilizes an information system)
#'''Hardware''': The term hardware refers to machinery. This category includes the computer itself, which is often referred to as the central processing unit (CPU), and all of its support equipment. Among the support, equipments are input and output devices, storage devices and communications devices.
#'''Software''': The term software refers to computer programs and the manuals (if any) that support them. Computer programs are machine-readable instructions that direct the circuitry within the hardware parts of the system to function in ways that produce useful information from data. Programs are generally stored on some input/output medium, often a disk or tape.
#'''Data''': Data are facts that are used by programs to produce useful information. Like programs, data are generally stored in machine-readable form on disk or tape until the computer needs them.
#'''Procedures''': Procedures are the policies that govern the operation of a computer system. "Procedures are to people what software is to hardware" is a common analogy that is used to illustrate the role of procedures in a system.
#'''People''': Every system needs people if it is to be useful. Often the most overlooked element of the system is the people, probably the component that most influence the success or failure of information systems. This includes "not only the users, but those who operate and service the computers, those who maintain the data, and those who support the network of computers."<ref>Kroenke, D. M. (2015). MIS Essentials. Pearson Education</ref>
#'''Feedback''': it is another component of the IS, that defines that an IS may be provided with feedback (Although this component isn't necessary to function).

Data is the bridge between hardware and people. This means that the data we collect is only data until we involve people. At that point, data is now information.

==Types of information system==
[[File:Four-Level-Pyramid-model.png|thumb|A four level hierarchy |250px]]

The "classic" view of Information systems found in textbooks<ref>Laudon, K.C. and Laudon, J.P. Management Information Systems, Macmillan, 1988.</ref> in the 1980s was a pyramid of systems that reflected the hierarchy of the organization, usually [[transaction processing systems]] at the bottom of the pyramid, followed by [[management information systems]], [[decision support systems]], and ending with [[executive information systems]] at the top. Although the pyramid model remains useful since it was first formulated, a number of new technologies have been developed and new categories of information systems have emerged, some of which no longer fit easily into the original pyramid model.

Some examples of such systems are:
* [[data warehouses]]
* [[enterprise resource planning]]
* [[enterprise systems]]
* [[expert systems]]
* [[search engines]]
* [[geographic information system]]
* [[global information system]]
* [[office automation]].

A '''computer(-based) information system''' is essentially an IS using computer technology to carry out some or all of its planned tasks. The basic components of computer-based information systems are:
*'''Hardware'''- these are the devices like the monitor, processor, printer, and keyboard, all of which work together to accept, process, show data, and information.
*'''Software'''- are the programs that allow the hardware to process the data.
*'''Databases'''- are the gathering of associated files or tables containing related data.
*'''Networks'''- are a connecting system that allows diverse computers to distribute resources.
*'''Procedures'''- are the commands for combining the components above to process information and produce the preferred output.

The first four components (hardware, software, database, and network) make up what is known as the information technology platform.
Information technology workers could then use these components to create information systems that watch over safety measures, risk and the management of data. These actions are known as information technology services.<ref>Rainer, R. Kelly Jr, and Casey G. Cegielski. Introduction to Information System: Support and Transforming Business Fourth Edition. New Jersey: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2012. Print.</ref>

Certain information systems support parts of organizations, others support entire organizations, and still others, support groups of organizations. Recall that each department or functional area within an organization has its own collection of application programs or information systems. These functional area information systems (FAIS) are supporting pillars for more general IS namely, [[business intelligence]] systems and [[dashboard]]s {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. As the name suggests, each FAIS supports a particular function within the organization, e.g.: accounting IS, finance IS, production-operation management (POM) IS, marketing IS, and human resources IS. In finance and accounting, managers use IT systems to forecast revenues and business activity, to determine the best sources and uses of funds, and to perform audits to ensure that the organization is fundamentally sound and that all financial reports and documents are accurate. Other types of organizational information systems are FAIS, [[Transaction processing system]]s, [[enterprise resource planning]], [[office automation]] system, [[management information system]], [[decision support system]], [[expert system]], executive dashboard, [[supply chain management system]], and [[electronic commerce]] system. Dashboards are a special form of IS that support all managers of the organization. They provide rapid access to timely information and direct access to structured information in the form of reports. Expert systems attempt to duplicate the work of human experts by applying reasoning capabilities, knowledge, and expertise within a specific domain.

==Information system development==
Information technology departments in larger organizations tend to strongly influence the development, use, and application of information technology in the business.
A series of methodologies and processes can be used to develop and use an information system. Many developers use a systems engineering approach such as the [[system development life cycle]] (SDLC), to systematically develop an information system in stages.  The stages of the system development lifecycle are planning, system analysis, and requirements, system design, development, integration and testing, implementation and operations, and maintenance.

This can be accomplished by outsourcing certain components or the entire system.<ref>{{cite book|title=Using MIS|year=2009|publisher=Kroenke|isbn=978-0-13-713029-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/usingmis00kroe}}</ref> A specific case is the geographical distribution of the development team ([[offshoring]], [[global information system]]).

* recording, storing, and disseminating linguistic expressions,

==As an academic discipline==
{{see also|Information engineering|Information science|Information technology|Information management}}

The field of study called ''information systems'' encompasses a variety of topics including systems analysis and design, computer networking, information security, database management, and decision support systems. ''[[Information management]]'' deals with the practical and theoretical problems of collecting and analyzing information in a business function area including business productivity tools, applications programming and implementation, electronic commerce, digital media production, data mining, and decision support. ''Communications and networking'' deals with telecommunication technologies.

Similar to computer science, other disciplines can be seen as both related and foundation disciplines of IS. The domain of study of IS involves the study of theories and practices related to the social and technological phenomena, which determine the development, use, and effects of information systems in organizations and society.<ref>John, W., and Joe, P. (2002) "Strategic Planning for Information System." 3rd Ed. West Sussex. John Wiley & Sons Ltd</ref> But, while there may be considerable overlap of the disciplines at the boundaries, the disciplines are still differentiated by the focus, purpose, and orientation of their activities.<ref name="dogpile.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.booksbw.com/books/computers/leslie-j/2006/files/informationsystems2006.pdf#page=30|title=Scoping the Discipline of Information Systems}}</ref>

In a broad scope, the term ''Information Systems'' is a scientific field of study that addresses the range of strategic, managerial, and operational activities involved in the gathering, processing, storing, distributing, and use of information and its associated technologies in society and organizations.<ref name="dogpile.com"/> The term information systems is also used to describe an organizational function that applies IS knowledge in the industry, government agencies, and not-for-profit organizations.<ref name="dogpile.com"/> ''Information Systems'' often refers to the interaction between algorithmic processes and technology. This interaction can occur within or across organizational boundaries. An information system is a technology an organization uses and also the way in which the organizations interact with the technology and the way in which the technology works with the organization's business processes. Information systems are distinct from [[information technology]] (IT) in that an information system has an information technology component that interacts with the processes' components.

One problem with that approach is that it prevents the IS field from being interested in non-organizational use of ICT, such as in social networking, computer gaming, mobile personal usage, etc. A different way of differentiating the IS field from its neighbours is to ask, "Which aspects of reality are most meaningful in the IS field and other fields?"<ref name="ref-basden-2010">[http://aisel.aisnet.org/ukais2009/10 Basden, A.

*[[Management information system|Management Information Systems]]  – A management information system (MIS) is an information system used for decision-making, and for the coordination, control, analysis, and visualization of information in an organization. 
*[[Project management|Project Management]]  – Project management is the practice of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria at the specified time.
*[[Enterprise architecture|Enterprise Architecture]] – A well-defined practise for conducting enterprise analysis, design, planning, and implementation, using a comprehensive approach at all times, for the successful development and execution of strategy.
* [[Software development|IS Development]]
* IS Organization
* [[Information technology consulting|IS Consulting]] 
* IS Security
* IS Auditor

There is a wide variety of career paths in the information systems discipline. "Workers with specialized technical knowledge and strong communications skills will have the best prospects. Workers with management skills and an understanding of business practices and principles will have excellent opportunities, as companies are increasingly looking to technology to drive their revenue."<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Sloan Career Cornerstone Center; Alfred P. Sloan Foundation|year=2008|url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/infosys/infosys.htm|title=Information Systems|access-date=June 2, 2008}}</ref>

Information technology is important to the operation of contemporary businesses, it offers many employment opportunities. The information systems field includes the people in organizations who design and build information systems, the people who use those systems, and the people responsible for managing those systems.
The demand for traditional IT staff such as programmers, business analysts, systems analysts, and designer is significant. Many well-paid jobs exist in areas of Information technology. At the top of the list is the chief information officer (CIO).

The CIO is the executive who is in charge of the IS function. In most organizations, the CIO works with the chief executive officer (CEO), the chief financial officer (CFO), and other senior executives. Therefore, he or she actively participates in the organization's strategic planning process.

==Research==
Information systems research is generally interdisciplinary concerned with the study of the effects of information systems on the behaviour of individuals, groups, and organizations.<ref>Galliers, R.D., [[M. Lynne Markus|Markus, M.L.]], & Newell, S. (Eds) (2006).

They identified research outputs as follows:

# ''Constructs'' which are concepts that form the vocabulary of a domain. They constitute a conceptualization used to describe problems within the domain and to specify their solutions.
# A ''model'' which is a set of propositions or statements expressing relationships among constructs.
# A ''method'' which is a set of steps (an algorithm or guideline) used to perform a task. Methods are based on a set of underlying constructs and a representation (model) of the solution space.
# An ''instantiation'' is the realization of an artefact in its environment.

Also research activities including:
# ''Build'' an artefact to perform a specific task.
# ''Evaluate'' the artefact to determine if any progress has been achieved.
# Given an artefact whose performance has been evaluated, it is important to determine why and how the artefact worked or did not work within its environment. Therefore, ''theorize'' and ''justify'' theories about IT artefacts.

Since the study of information systems is an applied field, industry practitioners expect information systems research to generate findings that are immediately applicable in practice. This is not always the case however, as information systems researchers often explore behavioral issues in much more depth than practitioners would expect them to do. This may render information systems research results difficult to understand, and has led to criticism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kock | first1 = N. | author-link = Ned Kock | author-link4 = Heinz Klein | last2 = Gray | first2 = P. | last3 = Hoving | first3 = R. | last4 = Klein | first4 = H. | last5 = Myers | first5 = M. | last6 = Rockart | first6 = J. | year = 2002 | title = Information Systems Research Relevance Revisited: Subtle Accomplishment, Unfulfilled Promise, or Serial Hypocrisy? | journal = Communications of the Association for Information Systems | volume = 8 | issue = 23| pages = 330–346 | doi = 10.17705/1CAIS.00823 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In the last ten years, the business trend is represented by the considerable increase of Information Systems Function (ISF) role, especially with regard to the enterprise strategies and operations supporting. It became a key-factor to increase productivity and to support new value creation.<ref>Casalino, N., Mazzone, G. (2008): Externalization of a banking information systems function. Features, regulatory and critical aspects, ''in Interdisciplinary Aspects of Information Systems Studies'', D’Atri A., De Marco M., Casalino N. (Eds.), Physica-Verlag, Springer, Heidelberg, Germany, pp. 89–96, {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2009-6}}, {{doi|10.1007/978-3-7908-2010-2_12}}</ref> To study an information system itself, rather than its effects, information systems models are used, such as [[EATPUT]].

The international body of Information Systems researchers, the [[Association for Information Systems]] (AIS), and its Senior Scholars Forum Subcommittee on Journals (23 April 2007), proposed a 'basket' of journals that the AIS deems as 'excellent', and nominated: ''[[Management Information Systems Quarterly]]'' (MISQ), ''[[Information Systems Research]]'' (ISR), ''[[Journal of the Association for Information Systems]]'' (JAIS), ''[[Journal of Management Information Systems]]'' (JMIS), ''[[European Journal of Information Systems]]'' (EJIS), and ''[[Information Systems Journal]]'' (ISJ).<ref>{{cite web|author=Senior Scholars|year=2007|title=AIS Senior Scholars Forum Subcommittee on Journals: A basket of six (or eight) A* journals in Information Systems |url=http://home.aisnet.org/associations/7499/files/Senior%20Scholars%20Letter.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003184529/http://home.aisnet.org/associations/7499/files/Senior%20Scholars%20Letter.pdf|archive-date=October 3, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A number of annual [[:Category:Information systems conferences|information systems conferences]] are run in various parts of the world, the majority of which are peer reviewed. The AIS directly runs the [[International Conference on Information Systems]] (ICIS) and the [[Americas Conference on Information Systems]] (AMCIS), while AIS affiliated conferences<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.aisnet.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=34|title=AIS affiliated conferences|access-date=2012-02-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215044835/http://home.aisnet.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&subarticlenbr=34|archive-date=2012-02-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> include the [[Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems]] (PACIS), [[European Conference on Information Systems]] (ECIS), the Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems (MCIS), the International Conference on Information Resources Management (Conf-IRM) and the Wuhan International Conference on E-Business (WHICEB).
