The '''''Royal Variety Performance''''' is a televised [[variety show]] held annually in the United Kingdom to raise money for the [[Royal Variety Charity]] (of which [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is life-patron).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalvarietycharity.org/royal-variety-charity/royal-patronage|title=Royal Patronage of the Royal Variety}}</ref> It is attended by senior members of the [[British Royal Family]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/TheRoyalVarietyPerformance/TheRoyalVarietyPerformance.aspx|title=British Monarchy Official Website}}</ref> The evening's performance is presented as a live [[variety show]], usually from a theatre in London and consists of family entertainment that includes [[comedy]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] and other speciality acts.

The ''Royal Variety Performance'' traditionally begins with the entrance of the members of the [[British Royal Family]] followed by singing of the national anthem, [[God Save the Queen]], which was also performed by the participating acts as a traditional end to Royal Variety Performances.

==Background and founding==
The first performance, on 1 July 1912, was called the '''[[Royal Command Performance]]''', and this name has persisted informally for the event. This was held in the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]], [[Shaftesbury Avenue]], London, in the presence of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. After correspondence with Sir [[Edward Moss]], the King said he would command a Royal Variety show in his coronation year, 1911, provided the profits went to the Variety Artistes' Benevolent Fund, as the Royal Variety Charity was then known. It was planned to be in the [[Empire Theatre (Edinburgh)|Empire Theatre]], [[Edinburgh]], part of the vast [[Moss Empires]] group, but the building caught on fire a month before the show. After the death of Moss, Sir [[Alfred Butt]] was chosen as the impresario and it was staged in 1912.<ref name="ReferenceA">Graeme Smith (2011) ''Alhambra Glasgow'' {{ISBN|978-0955942-01-3}}</ref> This was a lavish occasion, and his London [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] was lavishly decorated, complete with some 3 million rose petals.

===Artists and performers===
Top performers included [[Vesta Tilley]], [[George Robey|Sir George Robey]], [[David Devant]], [[Anna Pavlova]], [[Harry Lauder]] and [[Cecilia Loftus]]. The organisers did not invite [[Marie Lloyd]], because of a professional dispute. Her act was deemed too risqué and her three public, unsuccessful marriages were thought to make her unfit to perform in front of royalty.<ref name="eabf1912">{{cite web|url=http://www.eabf.org.uk/royal-variety-performance/archive/1910s/1912|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531094022/http://www.eabf.org.uk/royal-variety-performance/archive/1910s/1912|url-status=dead|archive-date=31 May 2009|title=1912, London Palace Theatre|publisher=[[Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund]]|accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref> She held a rival performance in a nearby theatre, which she advertised was "by command of the British public". The name of the event was changed to prevent possible royal embarrassment. The Royal Variety Performance became an annual event at the suggestion of King George V from 1921 and from 1927 the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] began to broadcast it on radio.

From 1928 through to 1938, the impresario-producer and manager of the [[London Palladium]], [[George Black (producer)|George Black]], took over the presentation of the Royal Variety Performance. He would also facilitate as compere at the shows. His first production was held on 1 March 1928 at the [[London Coliseum]] and from 1930 to 1937 he held the shows at the [[London Palladium]]. His 1938 show returned to the [[London Coliseum]]. Throughout World War II from 1939 to 1944 no shows were presented. The show resumed in 1945 after the war ended.

From 1960 to 2010, the BBC and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] broadcast a recorded version of the show, alternating the production between their two main channels, with the BBC producing and televising the 'even years' and ITV televising the 'odd years'. In both 1976 and 1978, the BBC broadcast the show live. The BBC usually staged the show in a [[West End theatre]], and ITV in regional theatres outside London. From 2011, ITV have exclusive rights to televise the show.<ref name="history" /> The show has been frequently staged in the [[London Palladium]] theatre, and in the 1950s and 1960s a television show based on the same idea, called ''[[Sunday Night at the London Palladium]]'' and hosted by many entertainers, including [[Bruce Forsyth]], ran for over 20 years.

A wide range of acts has performed at the Royal Variety Performance, including [[Laurel and Hardy]] in 1947, [[the Beatles]] in 1963, [[the Supremes]] in 1968 and [[the Blue Man Group]] in 2005. At the 1963 show, [[John Lennon]] delivered the famous line:

{{cquote|For our last number I'd like to ask your help: Will the people in the cheaper seats clap your hands? And the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewellery.}}

The money raised by the Royal Variety Performance provides most of the funding for the [[Royal Variety Charity]] (formerly the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund) and its care-home for retired members of the entertainment profession and their dependents, [[Brinsworth House]].<ref>[http://www.royalvarietycharity.org/ ''royalvarietycharity.org'']</ref><ref>[http://www.royalvarietycharity.org/royal-variety-charity ''royalvarietycharity.org'']</ref>

In 1974, [[Noele Gordon]] presented the Royal Variety Performance making her the female presenter of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalvarietycharity.org/royal-variety-performance/archive/detail/1974-london-palladium|title=Royal Variety Performance Archive 1974, London Palladium}}</ref>

After the first Royal Variety Performance on 1 July 1912 presented by [[Sir Alfred Butt]], it was seven years before the next show, on 28 July 1919 held at the [[Coliseum Theatre]] presented this time by Sir [[Oswald Stoll]]. The orchestra was conducted by [[Edward Elgar]]. In 1921 it moved to the [[Hippodrome, London|Hippodrome]], and was held in November. It was the first time that the Royal Variety Performance became an annual event. In 1923 it moved to the [[Coliseum Theatre]]. Then after a gap in 1924, moved to the [[Alhambra Theatre]] in February 1925, where it remained in 1926, held on 27 May. It was the first Royal Variety Performance to be broadcast, with the BBC providing live radio coverage.

In 1927 there was another move, this time to the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]], with J. A. Webb the compère. The 1928 show, on 13 December, was held at the [[Coliseum Theatre]]. The next show, on 22 May 1930, moved to the [[London Palladium]] with [[George Black (producer)|George Black]] and [[Val Parnell]] compèring. It was the start of seven successive years at the venue.

In 1935 the Royal Variety Performance was held in the Silver Jubilee year of [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. This was the last time King George V attended – he died three months later, in January 1936.

There have been two Royal Scottish Variety Performances, both attended by Queen Elizabeth, and presented by [[Howard & Wyndham]] Ltd in Glasgow's [[Alhambra Theatre]], which Sir Alfred Butt had opened, in 1958 and 1963.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The Children's Royal Variety Performance took place in London from 1981 to 1994 in aid of [[NSPCC]].

In 1990, ''A Royal Birthday Gala'' to celebrate the 90th birthday of the Queen Mother, was staged at the London Palladium on 19 July, replacing the traditional November/December Royal Variety Show that year. In place of the traditional show, a special programme called ''Thirty Years of the Royal Variety Performance'' aired on BBC One on 29 December 1990. It was hosted by [[Bruce Forsyth]] and took a look back at the BBC's television broadcasts of the programme over 30 years, with clips from the archives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/9e16689e21eb4d4992fd2347a61da251|title=Thirty Years of the Royal Variety Performance|date=20 December 1990|issue=3497|pages=120|accessdate=21 March 2018|via=BBC Genome}}</ref> After this variation, from 1991, the traditional variety show returned.

==''Britain's Got Talent''==
{{Main|Britain's Got Talent}}
Since 2007, one act of the Royal Variety show has been selected by the British public through the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television [[talent show]] ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]''.

A public [[Televoting|telephone vote]] decides the most popular act in each semi-final, which then progresses to the final, along with a second act chosen by the judges. The grand final is then broadcast live and all the acts perform again for the public vote.
