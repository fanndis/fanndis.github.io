A '''Commonwealth realm''' is a [[sovereign state]] which has [[Elizabeth II]] as its [[monarch]] and [[head of state]]. Each realm functions as an independent co-equal [[Realm|kingdom]] from the other realms.

In 1952, Elizabeth II was the monarch and head of state of seven independent states{{mdash}}the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] and [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]]. Since then, new realms have been created through independence of former colonies and dependencies and some realms have become republics.  As of 2020, there are 16 Commonwealth realms: [[Antigua and Barbuda]], Australia, [[The Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Belize]], Canada, [[Grenada]], [[Jamaica]], New Zealand, [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Tuvalu]], and the United Kingdom. All are members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], an intergovernmental organisation of 54 [[member states of the Commonwealth of Nations|independent member states]].  All Commonwealth members are independent sovereign states, whether they are Commonwealth realms or not.

== Current realms ==
There are 16 Commonwealth realms currently with a combined area (excluding the [[territorial claims in Antarctica|Antarctic claims]]) of 18.7 million km<sup>2</sup> (7.2 million mi<sup>2</sup>)<ref>Figures totalled from member state profiles at the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] secretariat, rounded to the nearest 100,000.</ref> and a population of around 151&nbsp;million<!-- 2020 -->,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/|title=World Population Prospects - Population Division - United Nations|website=population.un.org}}</ref> of which all but about two million live in the six most populous: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, and Jamaica.

Since each realm has the same person as its monarch, the diplomatic practice of exchanging ambassadors with [[Letter of credence|letters of credence and recall]] from one head of state to another does not apply. Diplomatic relations between the Commonwealth realms are thus at a cabinet level only and [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|high commissioners]] are exchanged between realms (though all other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations also follow this same practice, but for traditional reasons). A high commissioner's full title will thus be ''High Commissioner for Her Majesty's Government in [Country]''. For certain ceremonies, the order of precedence for the realms' high commissioners or national flags is set according to the chronological order of, first, when the country became a dominion and then the date on which the country gained independence.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/wp/british-flags/flying-flags-in-the-united-kingdom/british-flag-protocol/#index26| title=British Flag Protocol > Order for Commonwealth Events Held in the UK (but not the Commonwealth Games)| publisher=Flag Institute| accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>

Conflicts of interest have arisen from this relationship amongst independent states.  Some have been minor diplomatic matters, such as the monarch expressing on the advice of one of her [[Cabinet (government)|cabinets]] views that counter those of another of her cabinets.{{refn|During a British [[state visit]] to Jordan in 1984, Queen Elizabeth II made a speech expressing opinions of her [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]] that countered the views of her [[Cabinet of Australia|Australian Cabinet]],<ref>{{cite journal| first=Zelman| last=Cohen| title=Further Reflections on an Australian Republic| publisher=Sir Robert Menzies Lecture Trust| year=1995| url=http://www.menzieslecture.org/1995.html| format=Lecture| accessdate=3 May 2009| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055540/http://www.menzieslecture.org/1995.html| archive-date=28 September 2007| df=dmy-all}}</ref> though the Queen was evidently not representing Australia at that time.

One can therefore speak of 'the British Crown' or 'the Canadian Crown' or indeed the 'Barbadian' or 'Tuvaluan' Crown, but what one will mean by the term is the Crown acting or expressing itself within the context of that particular jurisdiction".<ref name=Toporoski/>|group=†|name=Toporoski}} The monarchy is therefore no longer an exclusively British institution,<ref name=Bogdanor/><ref name=Toporoski /> having become "domesticated" in each of the realms.<ref name=Mallory/>

From a cultural standpoint, the sovereign's name and image and other royal symbols unique to each nation are visible in the emblems and insignia of governmental institutions and militia. The Queen's effigy, for example, appears on coins and banknotes in some countries, and an oath of allegiance to the Queen is usually required from politicians, judges, military members and new citizens. By 1959, it was being asserted by Buckingham Palace officials that the Queen was "equally at home in all her realms".<ref>{{Cite book| last=Buckner| first=Phillip| publication-date=2005| contribution=The Last Great Royal Tour: Queen Elizabeth's 1959 Tour to Canada| editor-last=Buckner| editor-first=Phillip| title=Canada and the End of Empire| page=66| location=Vancouver| publisher=UBC Press| isbn=978-0-7748-0915-3| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27IggObUC9kC| accessdate=24 October 2009| year=2005}}</ref>

===Royal succession and regency===

To guarantee the continuity of multiple states sharing the same person as monarch, the preamble of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] laid out a convention that any alteration to the [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]] in any one country must be voluntarily approved by the parliaments of all the realms.{{refn|See [[Sue v Hill]].|group=†|name=SueHill}}<ref name=SOW>{{Cite book|date=11 December 1931| title=Statute of Westminster, 1931| location=Westminster| publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |id=c. 4 (U.K.)| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/22-23/4/contents| accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> This convention was first applied in 1936 when the British government conferred with the dominion governments during the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]]. Prime Minister of Canada [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] pointed out that the Statute of Westminster required Canada's request and consent to any legislation passed by the British parliament before it could become part of Canada's laws and affect the line of succession in Canada.<ref name=Twomey>{{cite AV media| people=[[Anne Twomey]]| title=Professor Anne Twomey – Succession to the Crown: foiled by Canada?| medium=Digital video| publisher=University College London| location=London| date=18 September 2014| url=http://vimeo.com/108335929}}</ref> Sir [[Maurice Gwyer]], [[Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (United Kingdom)|first parliamentary counsel]] in the UK, reflected this position, stating that the Act of Settlement was a part of the law in each dominion.<ref name=Twomey/> Though today the Statute of Westminster is law only in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom,<ref>{{citation| ssrn=1943287 | last=Twomey| first=Anne| title=Changing the Rules of Succession to the Throne| date=October 2011| pages=10–11| publisher=Sydney Law School}}</ref> the convention of approval from the other realms was reasserted by the [[Perth Agreement]] of 2011, in which all 16 countries agreed in principle to change the succession rule to [[absolute primogeniture]], to remove the restriction on the monarch being married to a Catholic, and to reduce the number of members of the Royal Family who need the monarch's permission to marry. These changes came into effect on 26 March 2015. Alternatively, a Commonwealth realm may choose to cease being such by making its throne the inheritance of a different royal house or by becoming a republic, actions to which, though they alter the country's royal succession, the convention does not apply.<ref>{{harvnb| Twomey| 2011| p=12}}</ref>

Agreement among the realms does not, however, mean the succession laws cannot diverge. During the abdication crisis in 1936, the United Kingdom passed [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936|His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act]] with the approval of the parliament of Australia and the governments of the remaining dominions. (Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa gave parliamentary assent later.<ref name=SydLaw>{{harvnb| Twomey| 2011| p=9}}</ref>) The Act effected Edward's abdication in the United Kingdom on 11 December; as the Canadian government had requested and consented to the Act becoming part of Canadian law, and Australia and New Zealand had then not yet adopted the Statute of Westminster, the abdication took place in those countries on the same day. The parliament of South Africa, however, passed its own legislation—[[His Majesty King Edward the Eighth's Abdication Act, 1937]]—which backdated the abdication there to 10 December. The Irish Free State recognised the king's abdication with the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936]] on 12 December.<ref name=SydLaw/><ref>{{Cite web| date=12 December 1936| title=Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936| location=Dublin| publisher=Office of the Attorney General| id=3.2| url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1936/en/act/pub/0058/sec0003.html| accessdate=6 May 2009}}</ref><ref>{{citation|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6Kx28VD_4MC&q=ireland+abdication+%22December+12%22&pg=RA3-PT173| last=Morris| first=Jan| title=Farewell the Trumpets|chapter=15| id=Note 13| year=2010| publisher=Faber & Faber| location=London| isbn=9780571265985| accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> According to Anne Twomey, this demonstrated "the divisibility of the Crown in the personal, as well as the political, sense."<ref name=SydLaw/> For E H Coghill, writing as early as 1937, it proved that the convention of a common line of succession "is not of imperative force".<ref>{{cite journal| first=E H| last=Coghill| title=The King – Marriage and Abdication| year=1937| journal=Australian Law Journal| volume=10| issue=393| page=398}}</ref> and Kenneth John Scott asserted in 1962 that it ended the "convention that statutory uniformity on these subjects would be maintained in the parts of the Commonwealth that continued to owe allegiance to the Crown".<ref>{{cite book| first=Kenneth John| last=Scott| title=The New Zealand Constitution| url=https://archive.org/details/newzealandconsti0000scot| url-access=registration| page=[https://archive.org/details/newzealandconsti0000scot/page/68 68]| publisher=Clarendon Press| year=1962| location=London}}</ref>

Today, some realms govern succession by their own domestic laws, while others, either by written clauses in their constitution or by convention, stipulate that whoever is monarch of the United Kingdom is automatically also monarch of that realm. It is generally agreed that any unilateral alteration of succession by the UK would not have effect in all the realms.{{refn|Noel Cox stated: "Any alteration by the United Kingdom Parliament in the law touching the succession to the throne would, except perhaps in the case of Papua New Guinea, be ineffective to alter the succession to the throne in respect of, and in accordance with the law of, any other independent member of the Commonwealth which was within the Queen's realms at the time of such alteration. Therefore it is more than mere constitutional convention that requires that the assent of the Parliament of each member of the Commonwealth within the Queen's realms be obtained in respect of any such alteration in the law."<ref>{{Citation |last=Cox |first=Noel |date=23 August 2003 |title=The Dichotomy of Legal Theory and Political Reality: The Honours Prerogative and Imperial Unity |ssrn=420752 |journal=Australian Journal of Law and Society |volume=14 |orig-year=1999 |issn=0729-3356}}</ref>

Richard Toporoski similarly stated: "[I]f, let us say, an alteration were to be made in the United Kingdom to the Act of Settlement 1701, providing for the succession of the Crown. It is my opinion that the domestic constitutional law of Australia or Papua New Guinea, for example, would provide for the succession in those countries of the same person who became Sovereign of the United Kingdom ... If the British law were to be changed and we [Canada] did not change our law ... the Crown would be divided. The person provided for in the new law would become king or queen in at least some realms of the Commonwealth; Canada would continue on with the person who would have become monarch under the previous law ...<ref name=Topo>{{cite journal|last=Toporoski |first=Richard |title=The Invisible Crown |journal=Monarchy Canada |issue=Summer 1998 |year=1988 |url=http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm |accessdate=21 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970617074036/http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm |archive-date=17 June 1997  }}</ref>|group=†|name=Cox}}

Following the accession of [[George VI]] to the throne, the United Kingdom created [[Regency Acts#Regency Act 1937|legislation that provided for a regency]] in the event that the monarch was not of age or incapacitated. Though input was sought from the dominions on this matter, all declined to make themselves bound by the British legislation, feeling instead that the governors-general could carry out royal functions in place of a debilitated or underage sovereign.<ref>{{cite book| last=Mallory| first=J.

===Monarch's role in the realms===
The monarch holds the highest position in each Commonwealth realm and may perform such functions as issuing [[Executive (government)|executive orders]], establishing or dismissing a government, commanding the military forces, and creating and administering laws.<ref>{{Harvnb| Boyce| 2008| p=4}}</ref>{{dubious|date=November 2020}}
[[File:RoyalVisitSenate.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[George VI]], with [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], grants [[Royal Assent]] to bills in the [[Senate of Canada]], 1939]]

The sovereign resides predominantly in her oldest realm, the United Kingdom, and thus carries out her duties there mostly in person. The Queen appoints [[viceroy]]s to perform most of the royal constitutional and ceremonial duties on her behalf in the other realms: in each, a [[governor-general]] as her personal national representative, as well as a [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]] as her representative in each of the [[Australian states]]. These appointments are all made on the advice of the prime minister of the country or the premier of the state concerned, though this process may have additional requirements.{{refn|In the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, the prime minister must consult the legislature in confidence; in Papua New Guinea, the governor-general is nominated to the Queen by a parliamentary vote.|group=†|name=Viceroy}} In certain other cases, the extent of which varies from realm to realm, specific additional powers are reserved exclusively for the monarch—such as the appointment of extra senators to the [[Canadian Senate]], the creation of honours, or the issuance of [[letters patent]]—and on occasions of national importance, the Queen may be advised to perform in person her constitutional duties, such as granting [[Royal Assent]] or issuing a [[Proclamation|royal proclamation]]. Otherwise, all royal powers, including the [[Royal Prerogative]], are carried out on behalf of the sovereign by the relevant viceroy, who, apart from those already mentioned, include a [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|lieutenant governor]] in each [[province of Canada]] (appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada]]). In the United Kingdom, the Queen appoints [[Counsellors of State]] to perform her constitutional duties in her absence.

Similarly, the monarch will perform ceremonial duties in the Commonwealth realms to mark historically significant events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/Overview.aspx |publisher=Royal Household |title=The current Royal Family |accessdate=2 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710092956/http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/Overview.aspx |archive-date=10 July 2009 }}</ref> Citizens in Commonwealth realms may request birthday or wedding anniversary messages to be sent from the sovereign.

===Religious role of the monarch===
It is solely in the United Kingdom that the Queen plays a role in organised religion. In England, she acts as the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]] and nominally appoints its bishops and archbishops. In Scotland, she swears an oath to uphold and protect the [[Church of Scotland]] and sends a [[Lord High Commissioner]] as her representative to meetings of the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|church's General Assembly]], when she is not personally in attendance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4709.asp |title=The Monarchy Today > Queen and State > Queen and Church > Queen and Church of Scotland |publisher=Royal Household |accessdate=25 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028202032/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4709.asp |archive-date=28 October 2008 }}</ref>

The governors-general throughout the Commonwealth realms also each use a personal flag, which, like that of the sovereign, passes to each successive occupant of the office. Most feature a [[Lions passant|lion passant]] atop a [[St. Edward's Crown|St. Edward's]] [[Crown (heraldry)#Commonwealth usage|royal crown]] with the name of the country across a scroll underneath, all on a blue background. The two exceptions are those of, since 1981, [[Flag of the Governor General of Canada|Canada]] (bearing on a blue background the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the [[Arms of Canada|Royal Coat of Arms of Canada]]) and, since 2008, [[Flag of the Governor-General of New Zealand|New Zealand]] (a St. Edward's Crown above the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] of the [[Coat of arms of New Zealand]]). The lieutenant governors of the Canadian provinces each have [[Flags of the Lieutenant-Governors of Canada|their own personal standards]], as [[Flags of the Governors of the Australian states|do the governors of the Australian states]].

==Historical development==
===Dominions emerge===
The possibility that a colony within the [[British Empire]] might become a new kingdom was first mooted in the 1860s, when it was proposed that the [[British North America]]n territories of [[Nova Scotia]], New Brunswick, and the [[Province of Canada]] unite as a [[confederation]] that might be known as the ''Kingdom of Canada''.<ref>{{cite book| last=Farthing| first=John| title=Freedom Wears a Crown| publisher=Veritas Paperback| year=1985| location=Toronto| isbn=978-0-949667-03-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Pope| first=Joseph| title=Confederation: Being a Series of Hitherto Unpublished Documents Bearing on the British North America Act| publisher=Kessinger Publishing| year=2009| location=Whitefish| page=177| isbn=978-1-104-08654-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Hubbard| first=R.H.| title=Rideau Hall| publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press| year=1977| location=Montreal and London| page=[https://archive.org/details/rideauhallillust00hubb/page/9 9]| isbn=978-0-7735-0310-6| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/rideauhallillust00hubb/page/9}}</ref>

Although the dominions were capable of governing themselves internally, they technically remained{{mdash}}especially in regard to foreign policy and defence{{mdash}}subject to British authority, wherein the [[Governor-General]] of each dominion represented the [[British monarch]]-[[Queen-in-Council|in-Council]] reigning over these territories as a single [[Empire|imperial]] domain. It was commonly held in some circles that the Crown was a monolithic element throughout all the monarch's territories; A.H. Lefroy wrote in 1918 that "the Crown is to be considered as one and indivisible throughout the Empire; and cannot be severed into as many kingships as there are dominions, and self-governing colonies."<ref>{{cite book| last=Lefroy| first=A.

What did follow was that the dominion governments gained an equal status with the United Kingdom, a separate and direct relationship with the monarch, without the British Cabinet acting as an intermediary, and the governors-general now acted solely as a personal representative of the sovereign in right of that dominion.{{refn|The ministers in attendance at the Imperial Conference agreed that: "In our opinion it is an essential consequence of the equality of status existing among the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations that the Governor General of a Dominion is the representative of the Crown, holding in all essential respects the same position in relation to the administration of public affairs in the Dominion as is held by His Majesty the King in Great Britain, and that he is not the representative or agent of His Majesty's Government in Great Britain or of any Department of that Government".<ref>{{harvnb| Balfour| 1926| p=4}}</ref>|group=†|name=Balf}}<ref>{{harvnb| Twomey| 2006| p=111}}</ref> Though no formal mechanism for tendering advice to the monarch had yet been established—former [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Billy Hughes]] theorised that the dominion cabinets would provide informal direction and the British Cabinet would offer formal advice<ref>{{cite journal| last=Jenks| first=Edward| title=Imperial Conference and the Constitution| journal=Cambridge Law Journal| volume=3| issue=13| page=21| year=1927| issn=0008-1973| doi=10.1017/s0008197300103915}}</ref>—the concepts were first put into legal practice with the passage in 1927 of the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927|Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act]], which implicitly recognised the Irish Free State as separate from the UK, and the King as king ''of'' each dominion uniquely, rather than as the British king ''in'' each dominion.

====Statute of Westminster====
{{main|Statute of Westminster 1931}}
These new developments were explicitly codified in 1931 with the passage of the Statute of Westminster, through which Canada, the Union of South Africa, and the Irish Free State all immediately obtained formal legislative independence from the UK, while in the other dominions adoption of the statute was subject to ratification by the dominion's parliament. Australia and New Zealand did so in 1942 and 1947, respectively, with the former's ratification back-dated to 1939, while Newfoundland never ratified the bill and reverted to direct British rule in 1934. As a result, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament at Westminster]] was unable to legislate for any Dominion unless requested to do so,<ref name=Heard/> although the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] was left available as the last court of appeal for some Dominions.<ref>{{cite book| last=Baker| first=Philip Noel| title=The Present Juridical Status of the British Dominions in International Law| publisher=Longmans| year=1929| location=London| page=231}}</ref> Specific attention was given in the statute's preamble to royal succession, outlining that no changes to that line could be made by the parliament of the United Kingdom or that of any dominion without the assent of all the other parliaments of the UK and dominions, an arrangement a justice of the Ontario Superior Court in 2003 likened to "a treaty among the Commonwealth countries to share the monarchy under the existing rules and not to change the rules without the agreement of all signatories."<ref>{{cite court| litigants =O'Donohue v.

Its first test came, though, with the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication of King Edward VIII]] in 1936,<ref name=Heard/> for which it was necessary to gain the consent of the governments of all the dominions and the request and consent of the Canadian government, as well as separate legislation in South Africa and the Irish Free State, before the resignation could take place across the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite book| last=Williams| first=Susan| year=2003| title=The People's King: The True Story of the Abdication| page=130| publisher=Penguin Books Ltd.| location=London| isbn=978-0-7139-9573-2}}</ref>

The civil division of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] later found in 1982 that the British parliament could have legislated for a dominion simply by including in any new law a clause claiming the dominion cabinet had requested and approved of the act, whether that was true or not.<ref>{{Cite court| litigants=Manuel et al. v. Attorney General| vol=822| pinpoint=p. 830| court=Court of Appeal of England and Wales| year=1982}}</ref> Further, the British parliament was not obliged to fulfil a dominion's request for legislative change. Regardless, in 1935 the British parliament refused to consider the result of the [[Secessionism in Western Australia#1933 referendum|Western Australian secession referendum of 1933]] without the approval of the Australian federal government or parliament. In 1937, the Appeal Division of the [[Supreme Court of South Africa]] ruled unanimously that a repeal of the Statute of Westminster in the United Kingdom would have no effect in South Africa, stating: "We cannot take this argument seriously. Freedom once conferred cannot be revoked."<ref>{{Cite court| litigants=Ndlwana v.

During his tenure as Governor General of Canada, [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|Lord Tweedsmuir]] urged the organisation of [[1939 royal tour of Canada|a royal tour]] of the country by King George VI, so that he might not only appear in person before his people, but also personally perform constitutional duties and pay a [[state visit]] to the United States as [[Monarchy of Canada|king of Canada]].<ref name=LAC>{{cite web| url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/king/023011-1070.06-e.html| last=Library and Archives Canada| author-link=Library and Archives Canada| title=The Royal Tour of 1939| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=6 May 2009| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030064730/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/king/023011-1070.06-e.html| archive-date=30 October 2009}}</ref> While the idea was embraced in Canada as a way to "translate the Statute of Westminster into the actualities of a tour," throughout the planning of the trip that took place in 1939, the British authorities resisted at numerous points the idea that the King be attended by his Canadian ministers instead of his British ones.<ref name=Parl>{{cite journal| last=Galbraith| first=William| title=Fiftieth Anniversary of the 1939 Royal Visit| journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review| volume=12| issue=3| year=1989| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/english/issue.asp?param=130&art=820| accessdate=6 May 2009| archive-url=https://archive.is/20121205052132/http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/english/issue.asp?param=130&art=820| archive-date=5 December 2012| url-status=dead}}</ref> The Canadian prime minister (still Mackenzie King) was ultimately successful, however, in being the minister in attendance, and the King did in public throughout the trip ultimately act solely in his capacity as the Canadian monarch.

When the [[Second World War]] began, there was some uncertainty in the dominions about the ramifications of Britain's declaration of war against [[Adolf Hitler]].

===Post-war evolution===
Within three years following the end of the Second World War, [[Dominion of India|India]], [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]], and [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]] became independent realms within the Commonwealth (then still called ''dominions''), though it was made clear at the time that India would soon move to a republican form of government. Unlike the Republic of Ireland and Burma at the time of their becoming republics, however, there was no desire on the part of India to give up its membership in the British Commonwealth, prompting a [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting|Commonwealth Conference]] and the issuance of the [[London Declaration]] in April 1949, which entrenched the idea of Canadian prime minister [[Louis St. Laurent]] that different [[royal house]]s and republics be allowed in the Commonwealth so long as they recognised as [[Head of the Commonwealth|the international organisation's symbolic head]] the shared sovereign of the United Kingdom and the dominions.<ref name=Smith>{{cite journal| last=de Smith| first=S.

As these constitutional developments were taking place, the dominion and British governments became increasingly concerned with how to represent the more commonly accepted notion that there was no distinction between the sovereign's role in the United Kingdom and his or her position in any of the dominions. Thus, at the 1948 Prime Ministers' Conference the term ''dominion'' was avoided in favour of ''Commonwealth country'', to avoid the subordination implied by the older designation.<ref>{{cite book| last=Statistics New Zealand| title=New Zealand Official Yearbook 2000| publisher=David Bateman| location=Auckland| page=55}}</ref>

The British [[Proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II|proclamation of Elizabeth II's accession]] to the throne in 1952 used the term "Realms", whereas previously the singular "Realm" was used to cover all "Dominions of the Crown", or the British Empire as a singular unit.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.enochpowell.net/fr-74.html| last=Powell| first=Enoch| author-link=Enoch Powell| title=Speech on the Royal Titles Bill| date=3 March 1953| publisher=enochpowell.net| accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2020|reason=Where does Powell say that the singular word was used in proclamations up to 1952?}}

The Commonwealth's prime ministers discussed the matter of the new monarch's title, with St. Laurent stating at the [[1953 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]] that it was important to agree on a format that would "emphasise the fact that the Queen is Queen of Canada, regardless of her sovereignty over other Commonwealth countries."<ref name=HCUK /> The result was a new [[Royal Style and Titles Act]] being passed in each of the seven realms then existing (excluding [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]]), which all identically gave formal recognition to the separateness and equality of the countries involved, and replaced the phrase "British Dominions Beyond the Seas" with "Her Other Realms and Territories", the latter using the word ''realm'' in place of ''dominion''. Further, at her coronation, Elizabeth II's oath contained a provision requiring her to promise to govern according to the rules and customs of the realms, naming each one separately. The change in perspective was summed up by [[Patrick Gordon Walker]]'s statement in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]]: "We in this country have to abandon... any sense of property in the Crown. The Queen, now, clearly, explicitly and according to title, belongs equally to all her realms and to the Commonwealth as a whole."<ref name=Bogdanor /> In the same period, Walker also suggested to the British parliament that the Queen should annually spend an equal amount of time in each of her realms. [[John Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham|Lord Altrincham]], who in 1957 criticised Queen Elizabeth II for having a [[Court (royal)|court]] that encompassed mostly Britain and not the Commonwealth as a whole,<ref>{{Cite book| last=Pimlott| first=Ben| title=The Queen| publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Ltd.| date=5 June 2002| location=New York| page=280| isbn=978-0-00-711436-8}}</ref> was in favour of the idea, but it did not attract wide support.<ref>{{Harvnb| Boyce| 2008| pp=9–10}}</ref> Another thought raised was that viceregal appointments should become trans-Commonwealth; the governor-general of Australia would be someone from South Africa, the governor-general of Ceylon would come from New Zealand, and so on.

In addition to the states listed above, the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] was a dominion when the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] was given royal assent but effectively lost that status in 1934, without ever having assented to the Statute of Westminster, and before the term Commonwealth realm ever came into use. Due to a domestic financial and political crisis, the [[General Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland legislature]] petitioned the UK to suspend dominion status,  the UK parliament passed the ''Newfoundland Act 1933'', and [[Commission of Government|direct rule]] was implemented in 1934. Rather than reclaiming dominion status after the Second World War, it became a province of Canada in 1949.<ref>J. K. Hiller. (2002).

===Republican referendums===
Six Commonwealth realms and Dominions have held referendums to consider whether they should become republics. As of January 2020, of the eight referendums held, three have been successful: in Ghana, in South Africa and the second referendum in Gambia. Referendums which rejected the proposal were held in Australia, twice in Tuvalu, and in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Interest in holding a second referendum was expressed in Australia in 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10995425| title=Australia's Gillard backs republic after Queen's death| date=17 August 2010| publisher=BBC| accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref> During the [[2020 Jamaican general election]] the [[People's National Party]] promised to hold a referendum on becoming a republic within 18 months if it won the election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20200808/pnp-vows-hold-referendum-whether-remove-queen-if-elected|title=PNP vows to hold referendum on whether to remove Queen, if elected|date=8 August 2020|website=jamaica-gleaner.com}}</ref> and polls suggested that 55% of Jamaicans desired the country become a republic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/55-of-respondents-say-the-queen-must-go_200465|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|website=Jamaica Observer}}</ref> However, the ruling [[Jamaica Labour Party]], which had in 2016 promised a referendum but not carried one out, was re-elected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/commentary/20200908/editorial-pms-governance-agenda-needs-clarity|title=Editorial &#124; PM’s governance agenda needs clarity|date=8 September 2020|website=jamaica-gleaner.com}}</ref>
