The '''Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party''' ({{lang-uk|Українська консервативна республіканська партія}}) was a [[political party]] in [[Ukraine]] in 1992 to 2001. It was created after a split in the [[Ukrainian Republican Party]] in 1992 led by [[Stepan Khmara]].<ref>Virtual Politics - Faking Democracy in the Post-Soviet World, [[Andrew Wilson (historian)|Andrew Wilson]], [[Yale University Press]], 2005, {{ISBN|0-300-09545-7}} (page 31)</ref> Later the party merged with the All-Ukrainian Union Fatherland, while the original Ukrainian Republican Party remained as an associate ally to Fatherland after merging with the Ukrainian People's Party Assembly.

The Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party performed poorly in the [[1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1994 parliamentary elections]] winning only two parliamentary seats originally, one of which was later overtaken by the former [[President of Ukraine]] [[Leonid Kravchuk]]. In the [[1998 Ukrainian parliamentary election|1998 parliamentary elections]] the party along with the Ukrainian Republican Party and the [[Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists]] participated in the "National Front" electoral bloc,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ubX9NdqScJsC&pg=PA112&dq=National+Front+1998+Republican+Party++Congress+of+Ukrainian+Nationalists&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=VxglUaTkEKi00QXlsoGoDw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=National%20Front%201998%20Republican%20Party%20%20Congress%20of%20Ukrainian%20Nationalists&f=false National Purpose in the World Economy: Post-Soviet States in Comparative Perspective] by [[Rawi Abdelal]], [[Cornell University Press]], {{ISBN|0801489776}} (page 112)</ref> the combination won 2,71% of the national votes<ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.da-ta.com.ua/mon_mainnews/805.htm Українська республіканська партія „Собор“], Database DATA</ref> and 6 constituencies.<ref name=1998UEVF>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LzChTG9xYJcC&pg=PA353&dq=1998+Ukraine+national+front+6+seats&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=OB8lUYysD8eW0QWz5oCYDw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=1998%20Ukraine%20national%20front%206%20seats&f=false State-Building: A Comparative Study of Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, and Russia] by [[Verena Fritz]], [[Central European University Press]], 2008, {{ISBN|9637326995}} (page 353)</ref><ref>{{in lang|uk}} [http://www.cvk.gov.ua/pls/vd2002/webproc0v?kodvib=1&rejim=0 Results in consistencies], [[Central Election Commission of Ukraine]] (1998)</ref> In January 2001 the "National Front" parliamentary faction had grown to 17 deputies.<ref name=1998UEVF/>
