The '''political crisis in Ukraine''' lasted from April to June 2007 was part of political stand off between coalition and opposition factions of [[Verkhovna Rada]] that led to the unscheduled [[2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election]]. It started on 2 April 2007 as a culmination of long lasting crisis and degradation of the parliamentary coalition when the [[President of Ukraine]] ([[Viktor Yushchenko]]) attempted to dissolve the parliament.

{{Politics of Ukraine}}
{{main|2007 Ukrainian parliamentary election}}
Leading up to the dissolution of parliament was the eight-month power struggle between the president and the parliament.<ref name="president">{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/data/1_14702.html|title=President dissolves parliament|publisher=Press office of President Victor Yushchenko|date=2 April 2007|accessdate=3 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901163210/http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/data/1_14702.html|archive-date=1 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ongoing power struggles between the [[Alliance of National Unity|Coalition of National Unity]] and the opposition supported by the president [[Viktor Yushchenko]] frequently resulted in the opposition boycotting the parliament's plenary sessions.

Prior to the President's 2 April decree dismissing Ukraine's Parliament, 11 members of the opposition supported the governing Coalition of National Unity (formerly the ''Anti-Crisis Coalition''). The President of Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, claimed that the right of individual members of a parliamentary faction to support the governing coalition was contrary to the provisions of [[s:Constitution of Ukraine#Article 83|Ukraine's Constitution]].

Article 83 clause six, in what is commonly referred to as the [[Imperative mandate (provision in the Constitution of Ukraine)|Imperative mandate]] stated ''"According to election results and on the basis of a common ground achieved between various political positions, a coalition of parliamentary factions shall be formed in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine to include a majority of People’s Deputies of Ukraine within the constitutional composition of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine"''.<ref name="Yushchenko_FT_letter">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/11cb086c-e249-11db-af9e-000b5df10621.html |title=Ukraine's crisis needs a firm response |newspaper=Financial Times |first=Viktor |last=Yushchenko |authorlink=Viktor Yushchenko |date=4 April 2007 |accessdate=4 April 2007  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506105213/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/11cb086c-e249-11db-af9e-000b5df10621.html |archivedate=6 May 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The week before the president's initial decree, on 2 April, dismissing Ukraine's Parliament, thousands of supporters of the opposition gathered in Kyiv, calling on the President dissolve the parliament.

On 2 April, the President, Viktor Yushchenko, following a meeting with Prime Minister [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and Speaker of the Parliament [[Oleksandr Moroz]], signed the first decree dismissing Ukraine's Parliament sparking another political and constitutional crisis in Ukraine.

The legality and authority of the President's determination to dismiss Ukraine's previous parliament has been the subject of a challenge in Ukraine's Constitutional Court.

On 30 April 2007, on the eve of the Court's ruling on the legality of the President's decrees, Viktor Yushcheko intervened in the operation and independence of Ukraine's Constitutional Court by dismissing three Constitutional Court judges. The President's actions were later determined by Ukrainian courts of have been illegal and one of the judges dismissed has been reinstated; the other two judges resigned. Following the President's intervention the Constitutional Court has not ruled on the legality of the previous parliament's dismissal.

==Dismissal of Constitutional Court judges and Prosecutor General==

{{Cquote|The Assembly deplores the fact that the judicial system of Ukraine has been systematically misused by other branches of power and that top officials do not execute the courts' decisions, which is a sign of erosion of this crucial democratic institution. An independent and impartial judiciary is a precondition for the existence of a democratic society governed by the rule of law. Hence the urgent necessity to carry out comprehensive judicial reform, including through amendments to the constitution.
The Assembly reiterates that the authority of the sole body responsible for constitutional justice – the Constitutional Court of Ukraine – should be guaranteed and respected. Any form of pressure on the judges is intolerable and should be investigated and criminally prosecuted. On the other hand, it is regrettable that in the eight months of its new full composition, the Constitutional Court has failed to produce judgments, thus failing to fulfill its constitutional role and to contribute to resolving the crisis in its earlier stages, which undermines the credibility of the court. There is an urgent need for all pending judgments, and in particular the judgment concerning the constitutionality of the Presidential Decree of 2 April 2007, to be delivered. If delivered, the latter should be accepted as binding by all sides.}}
