'''Rose Law Firm''' is an American [[law firm]] headquartered in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].

It dates its origins to November 1, 1820, sixteen years before [[Arkansas]] statehood, when [[Robert Crittenden]], born 1797, and [[Chester Ashley]], born 1791, entered into an agreement for a "Partnership in the Practice of Law". As such, it is the third oldest law firm in the [[United States]]<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/24/usa.suzannegoldenberg | title=The real state of the union: how well are the Clintons getting on? | author=Suzanne Goldenberg | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=May 24, 2006 }}</ref> and the oldest west of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref name="tvh11"/><ref name=Labaton>{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E2DB163AF935A15751C0A962958260 | title=Rose Law Firm, Arkansas Power, Slips as It Steps Onto a Bigger Stage | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | author=Stephen Labaton | date=February 26, 1994 }}</ref> It is also the oldest company of any kind in Arkansas.<ref name="tvh11">{{cite news | url=http://www.thv11.com/story/money/business/2014/02/20/1761954/ | title=Arkansas Business: Oldest companies in Arkansas | publisher=[[KTHV]] | location=Little Rock | date=July 10, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911022006/http://www.thv11.com/story/money/business/2014/02/20/1761954/ | archive-date=September 11, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
'''Early History - 1820-1865'''

The Rose Law Firm dates its formation to the 1820 partnership of Crittenden and Ashley, whose handwritten law partnership agreement hangs in the Rose boardroom.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rose Law Firm|title=History|url=https://www.roselawfirm.com/history/|access-date=April 15, 2019}}</ref> [[Robert Crittenden]] served as Arkansas' territorial governor and negotiated Arkansas' admission to the United States as the 25th state in 1836. [[Chester Ashley]] served as a United States Senator from Arkansas. Between 1837 and 1844, when Ashley was elected to the U.S. Senate, Ashley was Watkins' law partner.  Ashley's "original partnership with the well-connected Robert Crittenden had dissolved over political differences."<ref name="Pruden" />  Watkins' previous partnership, with James Curran, begun in 1844, had ended with Curran's death in 1854 (Watkins, a widower, married Curran's widow). Watkins was [[Arkansas Attorney General]] from 1848 to 1851; "however, his primary focus continued to be his private practice."<ref name="Pruden" /> From 1853 to 1854 Watkins was Chief Justice of the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] and did not practice law.<ref name="Pruden">{{cite encyclopedia

'''Rose Years - 1865-1905'''

Although the firm has changed its name a number of times, the first Rose family member to be associated with the firm occurred in 1865, when newly-arrived [[U. M. Rose]] formed a law partnership with George Claiborne Watkins.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History & Mission|url=https://www.roselawfirm.com/about/|access-date=October 24, 2020|publisher=Rose Law Firm|language=en-US}}</ref>  In 1881 the firm name became "U.M. Rose and Geo. B. Rose", George being Uriah's son. In 1893 W.E. Hemingway joined the firm, which became "Rose, Hemingway & Rose". In 1905 the firm merged with Cantrell and Loughborough.<ref>{{cite news

Rose Law Firm members have historically been active in politics and civic affairs.  U.M. Rose co-founded the [[American Bar Association]] and served as its president in 1901–1902. Rose was later appointed the American representative to the [[Second Hague Peace Conference]] and was instrumental in drafting the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]]. Six of the firm's members have served on the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] (three as Chief Justice), and six members have also served as President of the [[State bar association|Arkansas Bar Association]]. Rose Law Firm members have served as Commissioner of the Uniform Commission on State Laws, President of the National Association of Bond Lawyers and President of the Arkansas Bar Association.

'''Recent History - 1905-current'''

By the late 1970s, the firm had nine partners and a long name&nbsp;– Rose, Nash, Williamson, Carroll, Clay, & Giroir.<ref name="bernstein">[[Carl Bernstein]], ''[[A Woman in Charge|A Woman in Charge: The Life of Hillary Rodham Clinton]]'', [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], {{ISBN|0-375-40766-9}}. pp. 128–29</ref> The firm simplified its name to Rose Law Firm in 1980.<ref name="bernstein" />

In the economic realm, Rose has been termed "the ultimate establishment law firm"<ref name="bernstein" /> in the state and "the legal arm of the powerful".<ref name="maraniss">{{cite book | last=Maraniss | first=David | author-link=David Maraniss | title=First in His Class: A Biography of Bill Clinton | url=https://archive.org/details/firstinhisclassb00mara | url-access=registration | publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] | year=1995 | isbn=0-671-87109-9 | pages= [https://archive.org/details/firstinhisclassb00mara/page/369 369], 430}}</ref> During the 1970s, for example, its clients included [[Tyson Foods]], [[Wal-Mart]], large brokerage [[Stephens Inc.]], and [[Bank of America|Worthen Bank]], as well as the ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette|Arkansas Democrat]]'' and other [[WEHCO Media|Hussman family media holdings]].<ref name="bernstein" /> [[Hillary Rodham]] became the firm's first female associate,<ref name="bernstein" /> and soon its first female partner,<ref>{{cite book |author=Gerth, Jeff|author2=Van Natta Jr., Don |authorlink2=Don Van Natta Jr.  |title=[[Her Way|Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton]] |year=2007 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |location=New York |isbn=0-316-01742-6 |author-link=Jeff Gerth }} p. 60</ref> during her husband [[Bill Clinton]]'s tenure as [[Arkansas Attorney General]] and [[Governor of Arkansas]].

It is dominated by white men, most of whom came from privileged families in the state and graduated from one of the two accredited law schools in the state. Only a handful of women, and no blacks, have been made partners."<ref name="Labaton" />

Rose Law Firm entered the national news during the 1990s as part of the [[Whitewater (controversy)|Whitewater controversy]], as investigators sought to determine how much work Clinton had done for the firm while representing [[Jim McDougal]] in cases involving the latter's [[Madison Guaranty]] and [[Castle Grande]] enterprises.<ref>{{cite news | publisher=[[PBS]] | location=WGBH educational foundation | work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] | title=Rose Law Firm Billing Records | date=February 22, 1999}}</ref>

The firm's Little Rock building consists of both an old red brick structure, which was converted from a [[YMCA]] facility and has hardwood floors and an indoor swimming pool,<ref name="maraniss" /> and a connected newer structure. A second office in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]] was opened in 2017 when the members of the Henry Law Firm, which specialized in intellectual property law, were absorbed into the firm.<ref>{{Cite news|date=December 4, 2017|title=Little Rock's Rose Law Firm, state's oldest business, hangs shingle in Fayetteville|url=https://talkbusiness.net/2017/12/little-rocks-rose-law-firm-states-oldest-business-hangs-shingle-in-fayetteville/|publisher=Talk Business & Politics|language=en-US}}</ref>
