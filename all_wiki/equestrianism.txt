'''Equestrianism''' (from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|equester}}, {{lang|la|equestr-}}, {{lang|la|equus}}, 'horseman', 'horse'),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/equestrian |title=equestrian – definition of equestrian by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref> commonly known as '''horse riding''' ([[British English]]) or '''horseback riding''' ([[American English]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=equitaci%C3%B3n |title=equitación – Diccionario Inglés-Español |publisher=Wordreference.com |accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref> includes the disciplines of riding, [[Driving (horse)|driving]], or [[Equestrian vaulting|vaulting]] with [[horse]]s. This broad description includes the use of horses for practical [[working animal|working]] purposes, transportation, recreational activities, artistic or cultural exercises, and [[animals in sport|competitive sport]].

==Overview of equestrian activities==
Horses are [[horse training|trained]] and ridden for practical working purposes, such as in [[Mounted police|police work]] or for controlling herd animals on a [[ranch]]. They are also used in [[Horse#Sport|competitive sports]] including [[dressage]], [[endurance riding]], [[eventing]], [[reining]], [[show jumping]], [[tent pegging]], [[equestrian vaulting|vaulting]], [[polo]], [[horse racing]], [[driving (horse)|driving]], and [[rodeo]] (see additional equestrian sports listed later in this article for more examples).  Some popular forms of competition are grouped together at [[horse show]]s where horses perform in a wide variety of disciplines. Horses (and other [[equid]]s such as [[mule]]s) are used for non-competitive recreational riding such as [[fox hunting]], [[trail riding]], or [[Pleasure riding|hacking]]. There is public access to horse trails in almost every part of the world; many parks, [[ranch]]es, and public [[stable]]s offer both guided and independent riding. Horses are also used for [[therapeutic horseback riding|therapeutic]] purposes both in specialized para-equestrian competition as well as non-competitive riding to improve human health and emotional development.

[[Horses]] are also [[driving (horse)|driven]] in [[harness racing]], at [[horse show|horse shows]], and in other types of exhibition such as [[historical reenactment]] or ceremony, often pulling [[carriage]]s. In some parts of the world, they are still used for practical purposes such as [[farm]]ing.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leslie|first=Stephen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nkn-CgAAQBAJ&q=25%2C000|title=Horse-Powered Farming for the 21st Century: A Complete Guide to Equipment, Methods, and Management for Organic Growers|date=2015|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|isbn=978-1-60358-613-9|language=en}}</ref>

Horses continue to be used in public service, in traditional ceremonies (parades, funerals), [[police horse|police]] and volunteer mounted patrols and for [[mounted search and rescue]].

[[Riding hall]]s enable the training of horse and rider in all weathers as well as indoor competition riding.

==History of horse use==
[[File:Cave painting in Doushe cave, Lorstan, Iran, 8th millennium BC.JPG|thumb|Prehistoric cave painting, depicting a horse and rider]]
{{Main|Domestication of the horse|Horses in warfare}}
Though there is controversy over the exact date horses were [[domestication|domesticated]] and when they were first ridden, the best estimate is that horses first were ridden approximately 3500 BC. Indirect evidence suggests that horses were ridden long before they were driven. There is some evidence that about 3,000 BC, near the [[Dnieper River]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], people were using [[Bit (horse)|bits]] on horses, as a stallion that was buried there shows teeth wear consistent with using a bit.<ref name=Chamberlin69>Chamberlin, J. Edward ''Horse: How the Horse has Shaped Civilization'' New York:BlueBridge 2006 {{ISBN|0-9742405-9-1}}</ref> However, the most unequivocal early [[archeology|archaeological]] evidence of equines put to working use was of horses being driven. [[Chariot]] burials about 2500 BC present the most direct hard evidence of horses used as [[working animal]]s. In ancient times chariot warfare was followed by the use of [[horses in warfare|war horses]] as light and heavy [[cavalry]]. The horse played an important role throughout human history all over the world, both in warfare and in peaceful pursuits such as [[transportation]], [[trade]] and [[agriculture]]. Horses lived in North America, but died out at the end of the [[Ice Age]]. Horses were brought back to North America by European explorers, beginning with the second voyage of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] in 1493.<ref>Bennett, Deb (1998) 'Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship.'' Amigo Publications Inc; 1st edition. {{ISBN|0-9658533-0-6}}, p. 151</ref> Equestrianism was introduced in the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] as an Olympic sport with jumping events.

==Horse racing==
{{Main|Horse racing|Harness racing|Parimutuel gambling}}
Humans appear to have long expressed a desire to know which horse or horses were the fastest, and [[horse racing]] has ancient roots. [[Gambling]] on horse races appears to go hand-in hand with racing and has a long history as well. [[Thoroughbred]]s have the pre-eminent reputation as a racing breed, but other breeds also race.

===Types of horse racing===
Under saddle:
* [[Thoroughbred horse racing]] is the most popular form worldwide. In the UK, it is known as [[flat racing]] and is governed by the [[Jockey Club]] in the United Kingdom. In the US, horse racing is governed by [[The Jockey Club]]. other light breeds are also raced worldwide.
* [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechasing]] involves racing on a track where the horses also jump over obstacles. It is most common in the UK, where it is also called [[National Hunt]] racing.

In harness:
* Both light and heavy breeds as well as ponies are raced in harness with a [[sulky]] or racing bike. The [[Standardbred]] dominates the sport in both [[trot (horse gait)|trotting]] and [[Pacing (horse gait)|pacing]] varieties.
* The United States Trotting Association organizes [[harness racing]] in the United States.
* Harness racing is also found throughout Europe, New Zealand and Australia.

Distance racing:

* [[Endurance riding]], takes place over a given, measured distance and the horses have an even start.  Top level races are usually {{convert|50|to|100|mi|km}}, over mountainous or other natural terrain, with scheduled stops to take the horses' vital signs, check soundness and verify that the horse is fit to continue. The first horse to finish and be confirmed by the veterinarian as fit to continue is the winner. Limited distance rides of about {{convert|25|-|20|mi}} are offered to newcomers. Variants include [[Ride and Tie]] and various forms of [[long riding]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Nagy|first1=Annamaria|last2=Dyson|first2=Sue|last3=Murray|first3=Jane|date=18 June 2012|title=A veterinary review of endurance riding as an international competitive sport.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229435826|journal=The Veterinary Journal|language=en|volume=194|issue=3|pages=288–293|doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2012.06.022|pmid=22819800|via=Elsevier}}</ref>

==International and Olympic disciplines==
{{Main|Equestrian at the Olympics|International Federation for Equestrian Sports}}
Equestrian events were first included in the modern [[Olympic Games]] in 1900. By 1912, all three Olympic disciplines still seen today were part of the games. The following forms of competition are recognized worldwide and are a part of the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|equestrian events]] at the Olympics. They are governed by the rules of the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] (FEI).
* [[Dressage]] ("training" in [[French language|French]]) involves the progressive training of the horse to a high level of [[impulsion]], [[collection (horse)|collection]] and obedience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dressage-academy.com/training/dressage/|title=What is Dressage? – Dressage Academy Training|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> Competitive dressage has the goal of showing the horse carrying out, on request, the natural movements that it performs without thinking while running loose.
* [[Show jumping]] comprises a timed event judged on the ability of the horse and rider to jump over a series of obstacles, in a given order and with the fewest refusals or knockdowns of portions of the obstacles.
* [[Eventing]], also called ''combined training'', ''horse trials'', the ''three-day event'', ''the Military'' or ''the complete test'', puts together the obedience of dressage with the athletic ability of show jumping, the fitness demands the [[cross-country equestrianism|cross-country jumping]] phase. In the last-named, the horses jump over fixed obstacles, such as logs, stone walls, [[bank (obstacle)|banks]], [[ditch (obstacle)|ditches]] and [[water (obstacle)|water]], trying to finish the course under the "optimum time." There was also the 'Steeple Chase' Phase, which is now excluded from most major competitions to bring them in line with the Olympic standard.

The additional internationally sanctioned but non-Olympic disciplines governed by the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] are: [[combined driving]]; [[endurance riding|endurance]]; [[reining]]; and [[equestrian vaulting|vaulting]]. These disciplines are part of the [[FEI World Equestrian Games]] every four years and may hold their own individual World Championships in other years. The FEI also recognizes [[horseball]] and [[tent pegging]] as its two regional disciplines.

===Para-equestrian disciplines===
[[Para-equestrian]] competition at the international level, including the [[Equestrian at the Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]], are also governed by the FEI and offer the following competition events:
* Para-Equestrian Dressage is conducted under the same rules as conventional Dressage, but with riders divided into different competition grades based on their functional abilities.<ref>[http://www.fei.org/disciplines/dressage/about-para-equestrian-dressage ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508135709/http://www.fei.org/disciplines/dressage/about-para-equestrian-dressage |date=May 8, 2013 }}</ref>
* Para-Equestrian Driving places competitors in grades based on their skill.<ref>[http://www.fei.org/disciplines/driving/about-para-equestrian-driving ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501195554/http://www.fei.org/disciplines/driving/about-para-equestrian-driving |date=May 1, 2013 }}</ref>

==Haute École==
{{Main|Classical dressage}}
The ''haute école'' ([[French language|F.]] "high school"), an advanced component of [[Classical dressage]], is a highly refined set of skills seldom used in competition but often seen in demonstration performances.

The world's leading Classical dressage programs include:
* The [[Cadre Noir]] in [[Saumur]], [[France]].
* The [[Spanish Riding School]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].
* The [[Portuguese School of Equestrian Art]] at [[Queluz National Palace]], [[Portugal]].
* The [[Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Art]] in [[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Spain]].

Other major classical teams include the [[South African Lipizzaners]] and the [[Hollandsche Manege]] of the [[Netherlands]].

==Horse shows==
{{Main|Horse show}}

[[Horse show]]s are held throughout the world with a tremendous variety of possible events, equipment, attire and judging standards used. However, most forms of horse show competition can be broken into the following broad categories:
* [[Equitation]], sometimes called ''seat and hands'' or ''horsemanship'', refers to events where the rider is judged on form, style and ability.
* ''Pleasure, flat'' or ''under saddle'' classes feature horses who are ridden on the flat (not jumped) and judged on manners, performance, movement, style and quality.
* ''Halter, in-hand breeding'' or ''conformation'' classes, where the horse is led by a handler on the ground and judged on conformation and suitability as a breeding animal.
* ''Harness'' classes, where the horse is [[Driving (horse)|driven]] rather than ridden, but still judged on manners, performance and quality.
* ''Jumping'' or ''Over Fences'' refers broadly to both [[show jumping]] and [[show hunter]], where horses and riders must jump obstacles.

=="English" riding==
{{Main|English riding}}
In addition to the classical Olympic events, the following forms of competition are seen. In North America they are referred to as "[[English riding]]" in contrast with western riding; elsewhere in the world, if a distinction is necessary, they are usually described as "classic riding":
* [[Hunt seat]] or [[Show hunter|Hunter]] classes judge the movement and the form of horses suitable for work over fences. A typical [[show hunter]] division would include classes over fences as well as "Hunter under Saddle" or "flat" classes (sometimes called "hack" classes), in which the horse is judged on its performance, manners and movement without having to jump. Hunters have a long, flat-kneed trot, sometimes called "daisy cutter" movement, a phrase suggesting a good hunter could slice daisies in a field when it reaches its stride out. The over fences classes in [[show hunter]] competition are judged on the form of the horse, its manners and the smoothness of the course. A horse with good jumping form snaps its knees up and jumps with a good [[bascule (horse)|bascule]]. It should also be able to canter or gallop with control while having a stride long enough to make a proper number of strides over a given distance between fences. Hunter classes differ from jumper classes, in which they are not timed, and equitation classes, in which the rider's performance is the focus. Hunter style is based on fox hunting, so jumps in the hunter division are usually more natural colors than the jumps in a jumper division.
* [[Eventing]], [[show jumping]] and [[dressage]], described under "Olympic disciplines," above are all "English" riding disciplines that in North America sometimes are loosely classified within the "hunt seat" category.
* [[Saddle seat]], is a primarily American discipline, though has recently become somewhat popular in [[South Africa]], was created to show to best advantage the animated movement of high-stepping and gaited breeds such as the [[American Saddlebred]] and the [[Tennessee Walking Horse|Tennessee Walker]]. [[Arabian horse|Arabians]] and [[Morgan horse|Morgans]] may also be shown saddle seat in the United States. There are usually three basic divisions. ''Park'' divisions are for the horses with the highest action. ''Pleasure'' divisions still emphasis animated action, but to a lesser degree, with manners ranking over animation. ''Plantation'' or ''Country'' divisions have the least amount of animation (in some breeds, the horses are flat-shod) and the greatest emphasis on manners.
* [[Show hack]] is a competition seen primarily in the United Kingdom, Australia and other nations influenced by British traditions, featuring horses of elegant appearance, with excellent way of going and self-carriage. A related event is [[Riding horse (horse show)|riding horse]].

=="Western" riding==
{{Main|Western riding}}
{{see also|Reining||Western pleasure|Rodeo|Cutting (sport)}}
[[Western riding]] evolved from the cattle-working and warfare traditions brought to the Americas by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Conquistadors]], and both equipment and riding style evolved to meet the working needs of the [[cowboy]] on [[ranch]]es in the [[American West]].

Though the differences between English and Western riding appear dramatic, there are many similarities. Both styles require riders to have a solid seat, with the hips and shoulders balanced over the feet, with hands independent of the seat so as to avoid disturbing the balance of the horse and interfering with its performance.

The most noticeable feature of western style riding is in the saddle, which has a substantial [[saddle tree]] that provides support to horse and rider when working long hours in the saddle. The western saddle features a prominent pommel topped by a horn (a knob used for dallying a [[Lasso|lariat]] after roping an animal), a deep seat and a high cantle. The stirrups are wider and the saddle has rings and ties that allow objects to be attached to the saddle.

Western horses are asked to perform with a loose rein, controlled by one hand. The standard western bridle lacks a [[noseband]] and usually consists of a single set of reins attached to a [[curb bit]] that has somewhat longer and looser [[bit shank|shanks]] than the curb of an English [[double bridle|Weymouth]] bridle or a [[pelham bit]]. Two styles of Western [[rein]]s developed: The long split reins of the Texas tradition, which are completely separated, or the closed-end "[[Romal]]" reins of the California tradition, which have a long single attachment on the ends that can be used as a [[quirt]]. Modern [[rodeo]] competitors in timed events sometimes use a closed rein without a ''romal''.

Western riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, denim jeans, boots, and a wide-brimmed [[cowboy hat]]. [[Cowboy boot]]s, which have pointed toes and higher heels than a traditional riding boot, are designed to prevent the rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup during a fall, preventing the rider from being dragged—most western saddles have no safety bars for the leathers or automatic stirrup release mechanism. A rider may wear protective leather leggings called [[chaps]]. Clean, well-fitting work clothing is the usual outfit seen in [[rodeo]], [[Cutting (sport)|cutting]] and [[reining]] competitions, especially for men, though sometimes both men and women wear brighter colors or finer fabrics for competition than for work.

Show events such as [[Western pleasure]] use much flashier equipment, unlike the English traditions where clothing and tack is quiet and unobtrusive. Saddles, bits and bridles are ornamented with substantial amounts of silver. The rider may add a jacket or vest. Women's show clothing may feature vivid colors and even rhinestones or sequins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hobbyhorseinc.com/|title=Horse Show Apparel, Attire, Accessories|website=Hobby Horse Clothing Company, Inc.|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref>

Western horses are asked to have a brisk, ground-covering walk, but a slow, relaxed jog [[trot (horse gait)|trot]] that allows the rider to sit the saddle and not post. The Western version of the [[canter]] is called a ''lope'' and while collected and balanced, is expected to be slow and relaxed. Working western horses seldom use a sustained hand gallop, but must be able to accelerate quickly to high speed when chasing cattle or competing in [[reining]] events, must be able to stop quickly from a dead run and "turn on a dime."

==Harness==
[[File:Welsh-A-Buggy.jpg|thumb|left|A Welsh pony in fine harness competition]]
{{Main|Driving (horse)}}
Horses, [[mule]]s and [[donkey]]s are driven in [[Horse harness|harness]] in many different ways. For working purposes, they can pull a [[plow]] or other [[farm]] equipment designed to be pulled by animals. In many parts of the world they still pull [[wagon]]s for basic hauling and transportation. They may draw [[carriage]]s at ceremonies, in parades or for tourist rides.

As noted in "horse racing" ''above'', horses can race in harness, pulling a very lightweight cart known as a [[sulky]]. At the other end of the spectrum, some [[draft horse]]s compete in [[horse pulling]] competitions, where single or teams of horses and their drivers vie to determine who can pull the most weight for a short distance.

In [[horse show]] competition, the following general categories of competition are seen:
* [[Combined driving]], an internationally recognized competition where horses perform an arena-based "dressage" class where precision and control are emphasized, a cross-country "marathon" section that emphasizes fitness and endurance, and a "stadium" or "cones" obstacle course.
* [[Draft horse showing]]: Most [[draft horse]] performance competition is done in harness.
* [[Pleasure driving]]: Horses and ponies are usually hitched to a light cart shown at a walk and two speeds of trot, with an emphasis on manners.
* [[Fine harness]]: Also called "Formal driving," Horses are hitched to a light four-wheeled cart and shown in a manner that emphasizes flashy action and dramatic performance.
* [[Roadster (horse)|Roadster]]: A horse show competition where exhibitors wear [[racing silks]] and ride in a sulky in a style akin to [[harness racing]], only without actually racing, but rather focusing on manners and performance.
* [[Carriage]] driving, using somewhat larger two or four wheeled carriages, often restored [[antique]]s, judged on the turnout/neatness or suitability of horse and carriage.

==Rodeo==
{{main|Rodeo}}

Rodeo events include the following forms of competition:

===Timed events===
* [[Barrel racing]] and [[pole bending]] – the timed speed and agility events seen in [[rodeo]] as well as [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|gymkhana]] or [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|O-Mok-See]] competition. Both men and women compete in speed events at gymkhanas or O-Mok-Sees; however, at most professional, sanctioned rodeos, barrel racing is an exclusively women's sport. In a barrel race, horse and rider gallop around a cloverleaf pattern of barrels, making agile turns without knocking the barrels over. In pole bending, horse and rider run the length of a line of six upright poles, turn sharply and weave through the poles, turn again and weave back, then return to the start.
* [[Steer wrestling]] – Also known as "Bulldogging," this is a rodeo event where the rider jumps off his horse onto a steer and 'wrestles' it to the ground by grabbing it by the horns. This is probably the single most physically dangerous event in rodeo for the cowboy, who runs a high risk of jumping off a running horse head first and missing the steer or of having the thrown steer land on top of him, sometimes horns first.
* [[Goat tying]] – usually an event for women or pre-teen girls and boys, a goat is staked out while a mounted rider runs to the goat, dismounts, grabs the goat, throws it to the ground and ties it in the same manner as a calf. This event was designed to teach smaller or younger riders the basics of calf roping without the more complex need to also lasso the animal.

===Roping===
Roping includes a number of timed events that are based on the real-life tasks of a working cowboy, who often had to capture calves and adult [[cattle]] for [[livestock branding|branding]], medical treatment and other purposes. A lasso or [[Lasso|lariat]] is thrown over the head of a [[calf (animal)|calf]] or the horns of adult cattle, and the animal is secured in a fashion dictated by its size and age.
* [[Calf roping]], also called "tie-down roping," is an event where a calf is roped around the neck by a [[Lasso|lariat]], the horse stops and sets back on the rope while the cowboy dismounts, runs to the calf, throws it to the ground and ties three feet together. (If the horse throws the calf, the cowboy must lose time waiting for the calf to get back to its feet so that the cowboy can do the work. The job of the horse is to hold the calf steady on the rope) This activity is still practiced on modern working ranches for [[brand]]ing, medical treatment, and so on.
* [[Team roping]], also called "heading and heeling," is the only rodeo event where men and women riders may compete together. Two people capture and restrain a full-grown steer. One horse and rider, the "header," lassos a running steer's horns, while the other horse and rider, the "heeler," lassos the steer's two hind legs. Once the animal is captured, the riders face each other and lightly pull the steer between them, so that it loses its balance, thus in the real world allowing restraint for treatment.
* [[Breakaway roping]] – an easier form of calf roping where a very short lariat is used, tied lightly to the saddle horn with string and a flag. When the calf is roped, the horse stops, allowing the calf to run on, flagging the end of time when the string and flag breaks from the saddle. In the United States, this event is primarily for women of all ages and boys under 12, while in some nations where traditional calf roping is frowned upon, riders of both genders compete.

==="Rough Stock" competition===
[[File:Horses abreast IMG 5342.jpg|thumb|Small herd of rough stock in Texas.]]
In spite of popular myth, most modern "broncs" are not in fact wild horses, but are more commonly spoiled riding horses{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} or horses bred specifically as bucking stock.
* Bronc riding – there are two divisions in rodeo, [[bareback bronc]] riding, where the rider rides a bucking horse holding onto a leather [[surcingle]] or rigging with only one hand, and [[saddle bronc]] riding, where the rider rides a modified western saddle without a horn (for safety) while holding onto a braided lead rope attached to the horse's halter.
* Bull Riding – though technically not an equestrian event, as the cowboys ride full-grown bulls instead of horses, skills similar to bareback bronc riding are required.

===International rodeo===
* [[Australian rodeo]]
* [[Chilean rodeo]]
* [[Charreada]]

==Other equestrian activities==
[[File:PoloGirlsHorses.jpg|thumb|Girls and their horses preparing for a [[polo]] game]]
There are many other forms of equestrian activity and sports seen worldwide. There are both competitive events and [[pleasure riding]] disciplines available.

===Arena sports===
* Arena [[polo]] and [[Cowboy polo]]
* [[Pato]] (Argentina's national sport)
* [[Equestrian vaulting]]: In vaulting, a [[surcingle]] with two hoops at the top is attached around a horse's [[horse anatomy|barrel]]. The horse also wears a [[bridle]] with [[side reins]]. The vaulter is [[longeing|longed]] on the horse, and performs [[gymnastics|gymnastic]] movements while the horse walks, trots, and canters.
* [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|Gymkhana]], competition of timed pattern games, also known as ''O-Mok-See'' in the western United States.

===Horse sports that use cattle===
* [[Bullfighting]] (''[[rejoneador|rejoneo]]'')
**[[Portuguese-style bullfighting]]
**[[Spanish-style bullfighting]]
* [[Campdrafting]], a type of cattle-working competition popular in [[Australia]]
* [[Cutting (sport)|Cutting]]
* [[Team penning]]
* [[Working cow horse]]

===Defined area sports===
* [[Buzkashi]], a sport originating on the [[steppes]] of central [[Asia]], now the national sport of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].
* [[Cowboy mounted shooting]]
* [[Horseball]]
* [[Jousting]] and [[Skill at Arms]], events involving use of lances, swords and completion of obstacles. There are stand-alone competitions and also are often seen at [[historical reenactment]]s, [[Renaissance Fair]]s and [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] events.
* [[Mounted archery]]
** [[Yabusame]]
* [[Mounted Games]], a sport where games are played in a relay-style with two to five members per team at very high speed
* [[Polo]], a team game played on horses, involves riders using a long-handled [[mallet]] to drive a ball on the ground into the opposing team's [[goal (sport)|goal]] while the opposing team defends their goal
* [[Polocrosse]]
* [[Tent pegging]]

===Cross-country sports===
* [[Competitive Mounted Orienteering]], a form of orienteering on horses (but unrelated to [[orienteering]]) – consists of three stages: following a precise route marked on a map, negotiation of obstacles and control of paces.
* [[Techniques de Randonnée Équestre de Compétition|Le Trec]], which comprises three phases – trail riding, with jumping and correct basic flatwork. Le Trec, which is very popular in Europe, tests the partnership's ability to cope with an all-day ride across varied terrain, route finding, negotiating natural obstacles and hazards, while considering the welfare of the horse, respecting the countryside and enjoying all it has to offer.
* [[Competitive trail riding]], a [[pace race]] held across terrain similar to [[endurance riding]], but shorter in length (25 – {{convert|35|mi|km}}, depending on class). Being a form of [[pace race]], the objective is not to finish in the least time. Instead, as in other forms of [[judged trail ride|judged trail riding]], each competitor is graded on everything including physical condition, campsite and horse management. Horsemanship also is considered, including how the rider handles the trail and how horse is handled and presented to the judge and vet throughout the ride. The horse is graded on performance, manners, etc. "Pulse and respiration" stops check the horse's recovery ability. The judges also set up obstacles along the trail and the horse and rider are graded on how well they perform as a team. The whole point is the partnership between the horse and rider.
* [[Cross Country Jumping]], a jumping course that contains logs and natural obstacles mostly. The common clothes worn are usually brighter colors and less conservative.
* [[Endurance riding]], a competition usually of 50 to {{convert|100|mi|km}} or more, over mountainous or other natural terrain, with scheduled stops to take the horses' vital signs, check soundness and verify that the horse is fit to continue. The first horse to finish and be confirmed by the veterinarian as fit to continue is the winner. Additional awards are usually given to the best-conditioned horses who finish in the top 10.
* [[Fox hunting]]
* Hacking, or [[pleasure riding]].
* [[Hunter Pacing]] is a sport where a horse and rider team travel a trail at speeds based the ideal conditions for the horse, with competitors seeking to ride closest to that perfect time. Hunter paces are usually held in a series. Hunter paces are usually a few miles long and covered mostly at a canter or gallop. The horsemanship and management skills of the rider are also considered in the scoring, and periodic stops are required for veterinarians to check the vital signs and overall soundness of the horses.
* [[Ride and Tie]] is a form of [[endurance riding]] in which teams of 3 (two humans and one horse) alternate running and riding.
* [[steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechase]], a distance horse race with diverse fence and ditch obstacles.
* [[Trail Riding]], pleasure riding any breed horse, any style across the land.

==Health issues==
Handling, riding and driving horses have inherent risks. Horses are large prey animals with a well-developed [[flight or fight instinct]] able to move quickly and unexpectedly.  When mounted, the rider's head may be up to {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the ground, and the horse may travel at a speed of up to {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Mechanisms of injury===
The most common injury is falling from the horse, followed by being kicked, trampled and bitten. About 3 out of 4 injuries are due to falling, broadly defined.<ref name="ReferenceB">"Most injuries result from falls (80%)", ''Horse riding during pregnancy'', MS Rogers.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=March 1987|title=Riding and other equestrian injuries: Considerable severity|journal=[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]|volume=21|issue=1|pages=22–24|doi=10.1136/bjsm.21.1.22|pmc=1478604|pmid=3580722|author=R.

===Head injuries===
Horseback riding is one of the most dangerous sports, especially in relation to head injury. Statistics from the United States, for example, indicate that about 30 million people ride horses annually.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Deloitte|first1=C|title=National economic impact of U.S. horse industry|url=http://www.horsecouncil.org/nationaleconomics.php|website=American Horse Council Foundation|date=2005|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203123251/http://www.horsecouncil.org/nationaleconomics.php|archive-date=2010-02-03}}</ref> On average, about 67,000 people are admitted to the hospital each year from injuries sustained while working with horses.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Loder R | year = 2008 | title = The demographics of equestrian-related injuries in the United States: injury patterns, orthopedic specific injuries, and avenues for injury prevention | journal = The Journal of Trauma: Injury, Infection, and Critical Care | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 447–60 | doi=10.1097/ta.0b013e31817dac43 | pmid=18695484}}</ref> 15,000 of those admittances are from traumatic brain injuries.

===Rules on helmet use in competition===

Many organizations mandate helmet use in competition or on show grounds, and rules have continually moved in the direction of requiring helmet use. In 2011, the United States Equestrian Federation passed a rule making helmet use mandatory while mounted on competition grounds at U.S. nationally rated eventing competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horsechannel.com/horse-news/2011/01/27/eventing-dressage-helmet-rule.aspx|title=New Helmet Rules for Eventing and Dressage Passed at USEF Convention|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref> Also in 2011, the United States Dressage Federation made helmet use in competition mandatory for all riders under 18 and all riders who are riding any test at Fourth Level and below.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usef.org/_IFrames/RuleBook/Changes/2011.aspx|title=2011 Rule Changes|website=United States Equestrian Federation|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref> If a rider competing at Prix St. Georges and above is also riding a test at Fourth Level or below, he or she must also wear a helmet at all times while mounted.

==Criticism of horses in sport==
{{see also|Horse racing|Rodeo}}
Organized welfare groups, such as the [[Humane Society of the United States]], and [[animal rights]] groups such as [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], have been known to criticise some horse sports with claims of [[animal cruelty]].

[[Horse racing]] is a popular equestrian sport which is practiced in many nations around the world. It is inextricably associated with [[gambling]], where in certain events, stakes can become very high. Despite its illegality in most competitions, these conditions of extreme competitiveness can lead to the use of performing-enhancing drugs and extreme training techniques, which can result in negative side effects for the horses' well-being.
The races themselves have also proved dangerous to the horses – especially [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechasing]], which requires the horse to jump hurdles whilst galloping at full speed. This can result in injury or death to the horse, as well as the jockey.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/705194.stm | work=BBC News | title=Should steeplechases be banned? | date=2000-04-17}}</ref> A study by animal welfare group [[Animal Aid]] revealed that approximately 375 racehorses die yearly, with 30% of these either during or as a result of injuries from a race.<ref name="animalaid">{{cite web |url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/AA/HOME/ALL/1665// |title=Bred To Death: Background Notes |publisher=Animal Aid |accessdate=2013-07-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510144228/http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/AA/HOME/ALL/1665// |archive-date=2013-05-10 }}</ref> The report also highlighted the increasing frequency of race-related illnesses, including bleeding lungs (exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage) and gastric ulcers.<ref name="animalaid" />

Animal rights groups are also primarily concerned that certain sports or training exercises may cause unnecessary pain or injuries to horse athletes. Some specific training or showing practices are so widely condemned that they have been made illegal at the national level and violations can incur criminal penalties. The most well-known is ''soring,'' a practice of applying a caustic ointment just above the hooves of a [[Tennessee Walking Horse]] to make it pick up its feet higher. However, in spite of a federal law in the United States prohibiting this practice and routine inspections of horse shows by inspectors from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], soring is still widespread and difficult to eliminate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/lameness/soring_030706/|title=EQUUS Special Report: Why Soring Persists|accessdate=31 May 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909111123/http://www.equisearch.com/article/soring_030706|archive-date=9 September 2014}}</ref> Some events themselves are also considered so abusive that they are banned in many countries. Among these are horse-tripping, a sport where riders chase and rope a loose-running horse by its front legs, throwing it to the ground.<ref>[http://www.idausa.org/facts/horsetripping.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315182541/http://www.idausa.org/facts/horsetripping.html |date=March 15, 2013 }}</ref>

Secondary effects of racing have also recently been uncovered. A 2006 investigation by [[The Observer]] in the UK found that each year 6,000–10,000 horses are slaughtered for consumption abroad, a significant proportion of which are horses bred for racing.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/01/horseracing.sport | work=The Guardian | first=Antony | last=Barnett | title=The slaughtered horses that shame our racing | date=2006-10-06}}</ref> A boom in the number of foals bred has meant that there is not adequate resources to care for unwanted horses. Demand has increased for this massive breeding programme to be scaled back.<ref name="guardian" /> Despite over 1000 foals being produced annually by the Thoroughbred [[horse industry]], 66% of those bred for such a purpose were never entered into a race, and despite a life expectancy of 30 years, many are killed before their fifth birthday.<ref name="guardian" />

== Horse riding on coinage ==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:2003 Greece 10 Euro OS Horse Riding front.jpg|thumb|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Horse Riding commemorative coin]]]] -->
Horse riding events have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins. One of the recent samples is the €10 Greek [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Horse Riding commemorative coin]], minted in 2003 to commemorate the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. On the composition of the obverse of this coin, the modern horseman is pictured as he jumps over an obstacle, while in the background the ancient horseman is inspired by a representation on a black-figure vase of the 5th century BC.

For the 2012 Olympics, the Royal Mint has produced a 50p coin showing a horse jumping a fence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalmint.com/shop/london_2012_50p_sports_collection_equestrian|title=London 2012 50p Sports Collection – Equestrian|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref>
