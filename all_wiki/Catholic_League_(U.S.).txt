The '''Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights''', often shortened to the '''Catholic League''', is an American Catholic [[defamation|anti-defamation]] and [[civil rights]] organization. The Catholic League states that it "defends the right of Catholics – lay and clergy alike – to participate in American public life without defamation or discrimination."<ref name="About Us">[https://www.catholicleague.org/about-us// "About Us"] on the Catholic League's website</ref> The Catholic League states that it is "motivated by the letter and the spirit of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]&nbsp;... to safeguard both the religious freedom rights and the free speech rights of Catholics whenever and wherever they are threatened."<ref name="About Us"/> According to the ''Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics'', the League "is regarded by many as the preeminent organization representing the views of American lay Catholics."<ref name=Encyclopedia/>

Founded in 1973 by Jesuit priest [[Virgil Blum]], the Catholic League was formed to counter discrimination against Catholics in the U.S. government and in popular culture. The low-profile group initiated public education campaigns and some lawsuits. In 1993 the group became much more aggressive with a new president, former sociology professor [[Bill Donohue]], who also increased its size to become the largest Catholic advocacy organization in America.<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frt7RDOT1PUC&pg=PA82 |pages=82–83 |title=Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics |first1=Paul A. |last1=Djupe |first2=Laura R. |last2=Olson |year=2003 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=0-8160-4582-8 |series=Facts on File Library of American History}}</ref> The Catholic League is known for [[press release]]s about what it views as [[anti-Catholic]] and [[anti-Christian]] themes in [[mass media]].

The Catholic League has taken a stand against anything they perceive as anti-Catholic, including the entertainment industry, certain art exhibits, school programs for sex education, government-funded contraception and abortion, media bias, restrictions against pro-life activism, and restrictions on religious schools.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1KFNeoVo-UC&pg=PA343 |page=343 |title=Being right: conservative Catholics in America |last=Weaver |first=Mary Jo |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-253-20999-4}}</ref> It publishes a journal, ''Catalyst'', and operates a website.

==Organizational overview==

===History===
{{Expand section|date=December 2007}}
The League was founded in [[Milwaukee]] in 1973 by [[Virgil Blum|Virgil C.

===Bill Donohue===
{{Main|Bill Donohue}}
Since 1993, the League has been led by its Board of Directors president, Bill Donohue, who works with a small number of organizational staffers. In a 1999 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, a reporter said Donohue is [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] in regards to [[religion]], "[[Broadcast media|media]] savvy" and "steers clear of divisive debates on [[Theology|theological]] [[doctrine]]s and [[secular]] politics".<ref name="winniehu1999">{{cite news

===Operations and organization===
The League is organized under a Board of Directors chaired by Walter Knysz. The League also has Board of Advisors, consisting of prominent lay Catholics like [[L. Brent Bozell III|Brent Bozell]], [[Linda Chavez]], [[Mary Ann Glendon]], [[Alan Keyes]], [[Tom Monaghan]] and [[George Weigel]].<ref name="About Us"/> The League issues a journal, ''Catalyst'', as well as reports, such as ''Pope [[Pius XII]] and the Holocaust,'' books, brochures and an annual ''Report on Anti-Catholicism''.

===Association with the Catholic Church===
The Catholic League is a lay Catholic organization that is independent of the Catholic Church. However, it is listed in ''The Official Catholic Directory'' (see the Miscellaneous section under the Archdiocese of New York). According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' interviewer, the organization "maintains close ties to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|New York Archdiocese]] leadership. Several bishops make personal donations. [[Cardinal O'Connor]] spoke at the group's 25th anniversary reception in 1998 and vacated part of his suite for its expanding operations, said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York."<ref name="winniehu1999"/> The League includes on its website endorsements from many prominent clerics.

===Membership===
''The New York Times'' reported that the Catholic League had 11,000 members when Donohue took over the group in 1993. By 1999, membership had grown to 350,000, two-thirds of whom were paying members.<ref name="winniehu1999"/> This is the last estimate of overall membership that the League made. The League's 2003 statement showed 15,000 members in [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau]] and [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk]] counties of New York alone.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/03/nyregion/the-battle-is-joined-over-bishop-murphy.html “The Battle is Joined Over Bishop Murphy”] ''The New York Times'', 3 August 2003</ref> Annual donations entitle members to home delivery of the print version of ''Catalyst'', the group's monthly journal, which is also available for free on the Catholic League's website.

===Political alignment===
The Catholic League says it is politically neutral, which is mostly required of non-profits. The website states, "The League wishes to be neither left nor right, liberal or conservative, revolutionary or reactionary."<ref name="About Us"/> Although often characterized as conservative<ref>{{cite news

==Activities==

===Joan Osborne===
In 1996, Donohue took issue with [[Joan Osborne]] over her song "[[One of Us (Joan Osborne song)|One of Us]]", which explores the question of what it would be like if [[God]] were a human being.<ref>[http://www.catholicleague.org/catalyst/1996_catalyst/496catalyst.html#GRAMMY%20NOMINEE%20JOAN%20OSBORNE%20%22RELISHES%22%20CONTROVERSY Donohue's campaign against pop singer Joan Osborne] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311020052/http://www.catholicleague.org/catalyst/1996_catalyst/496catalyst.html#GRAMMY%20NOMINEE%20JOAN%20OSBORNE%20%22RELISHES%22%20CONTROVERSY |date=March 11, 2007 }}</ref> Donohue questioned the point of the song and brought up her [[activism]] calling for support of ''[[Rock for Choice]]'' and other [[pro-choice]] groups stating, "It is no wonder that Joan Osborne instructs her fans to donate their time and money to [[Planned Parenthood]]. It is of a piece with her politics and her prejudices. Her songs and videos offer a curious mix of both, the effect of which is to dance awfully close to the line of Catholic baiting."<ref>[http://www.catholicleague.org/catalyst.php?year=1996&month=April&read=41 Grammy Nominee Joan Osborne "Relishes" controversy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211001424/http://www.catholicleague.org/catalyst.php?year=1996&month=April&read=41 |date=February 11, 2009 }}, ''The Catalyst'' Vol. 23, No. 3, April 1996</ref> Religious educator Paul Moses stated that Donohue's was a "tortured reading" and he saw Osborne as having "the Catholic imagination" with the song "awakening ... spiritual hunger".<ref name="One Of Us' - dad listens"/> Osborne said, in a letter to fans, that "the church's attitudes toward women and gays make the pope look far more ridiculous than any pop song could" and that she did not write the song, which "speaks of the pope only with respect."<ref name="One Of Us' - dad listens">Paul Moses "'One Of Us' - dad listens to daughter - religion and Joan Osborne's hit pop record".

===''Nothing Sacred''===
In 1997, Donohue declared the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show ''[[Nothing Sacred (TV series)|Nothing Sacred]]'' as deeply offensive to Catholicism, although not anti-Catholic in the traditional sense.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/nothing-sacred/show/261/episode_guide.html Nothing Sacred Episode Guide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217032331/http://www.tv.com/nothing-sacred/show/261/episode_guide.html |date=February 17, 2009 }}</ref><ref>Donohue, William [http://www.catholicleague.org/1997report/report97.htm Catholic League's 1997 Report on Anti-Catholicism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607184422/http://www.catholicleague.org/1997report/report97.htm |date=June 7, 2007 }}, Catholic League, 1997</ref> Calling for a [[boycott]], he stated that the show portrayed Catholics with a traditional view as cold or cruel while glorifying more the maverick, irreverent voices in the community. However, the show was defended by some Catholics and had been written with the consultation of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], from which it later won the [[Humanitas Prize]]. Many Catholics agreed with him that the show was hostile to the beliefs and values of the Catholic Church, and ABC canceled ''Nothing Sacred'' after less than a season, reportedly for poor ratings. Observers think Donohue may have played a significant role in the show's rapid demise as advertisers often become leery of shows deemed "controversial".<ref>[http://www.dailycatholic.org/issue/99Aug/aug31top.htm Top 100 Catholics of the century], ''Daily Catholic'', Vol. 10, No. 164, August 31, 1999</ref><ref>Seal, Cynthia [http://www.sffaith.com/ed/articles/1997/1197cs.htm Hollywood's treatment of Catholicism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212182029/http://www.sffaith.com/ed/articles/1997/1197cs.htm |date=February 12, 2009 }}, ''San Francisco Faith'', November 1997</ref> With regard to the controversy, [[Henry Herx]], director of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]' Office of Film and Broadcast (successor to the [[National Legion of Decency]]), emphasized that the Catholic League is not an official agency of the church.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_n43_v33/ai_19910349] Despite boycott, 'Sacred' draws Catholic applause - ABC-TV series 'Nothing Sacred' National Catholic Reporter, Oct 10, 1997 by John Allen</ref>

===''Dogma''===
The year 1999 saw the release of [[Kevin Smith]]'s controversial film ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''. Smith is a practicing Catholic, as Kevin Smith confirmed in an interview on the film's [[DVD]]. Several religious groups, especially the Catholic League, said the film was anti-Catholic and [[blasphemy|blasphemous]], and organized protests, including one that took place at the November 12 premiere of the film at [[Lincoln Center]] in [[New York City]].

Smith said that several of the protests occurred before the film was even finished, suggesting that the protests were more about media attention for the groups than for whatever was controversial about the film.<ref name="newsaskew.com">Penhollow, Steve [http://www.newsaskew.com/dogmarc/article148.html Director Kevin Smith calls himself a devout Catholic and says his latest comedy, ''Dogma'', is "pro-faith, pro-Catholic, spiritually uplifting."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205911/http://www.newsaskew.com/dogmarc/article148.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}, ''The Journal Gazette''</ref> The Catholic League's main complaints were that the film's main character is supposedly a descendant of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], who happens to work in an [[abortion clinic]], which were seen as ironic conventions for a Catholic.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The film's distributor, [[Miramax]], removed its name from the production, and hired attorney [[Dan Petrocelli]] to defend it publicly. Petrocelli accused Donohue of trying to stir a violent reaction to the film. Donohue responded by taking out an op-ed ad in the ''New York Times'' on September 12, 1999, saying that the comments were an attempt to stifle his free speech.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://70.40.202.97/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wiil-censors-stand-up.pdf|title="WILL THE REAL CENSORS PLEASE STAND UP" Catholic League ad appeared on Sept. 12,1999 in the New York Times}}</ref>

According to Smith, "[Donohue] actually invited me out to have a beer after making my life hell for six months."<ref>Croft & Reiter, [http://archive.salon.com/ent/col/fix/2004/01/23/mon/index.html The Fix] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211004623/http://archive.salon.com/ent/col/fix/2004/01/23/mon/index.html |date=February 11, 2009 }}, ''[[Salon.com]]'' Jan. 23, 2004</ref>

===''The Passion of the Christ''===
Donohue is a staunch defender of [[Mel Gibson]]'s film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''. On the December 8, 2004, broadcast of ''[[Scarborough Country]]'', he stated: "Hollywood is controlled by secular Jews who hate Christianity in general and Catholicism in particular. It's not a secret, OK? And I'm not afraid to say it. That's why they hate this movie. It's about Jesus Christ, and it's about truth. It's about the [[Messiah]]."<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6685898 "'Scarborough Country' for Dec. 8"], Transcript for 10 p.m. ET show updated 12/9/2004 10:48:12 AM ET. Retrieved 2012-12-12.</ref>

In Donohue's book, ''Secular Sabotage: How Liberals Are Destroying Religion and Culture in America'', he responded to what he believed was misrepresentation of his comments via taking them out of context. For example, in that same interview, he said the following: "You have got secular Jews. You have got a lot of ex-Catholic priests who hate the Catholic Church, wacko Protestants in the same group." Later in the debate, in that same segment of the interview, he said, "There are secularists from every ethnic and religious stock," emphasizing that when people talk about Hollywood, they are "talking mostly about secular Jews."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Secular Sabotage: How Liberals Are Destroying Religion and Culture in America|last=Donohue|first=Bill|publisher=New York: FaithWords|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages= 84–89}}</ref>

In his book, Donohue also wrote the following: "The ''Forward'', a Jewish weekly, published an editorial in 2004 saying it was merely a 'sociological observation' to note that 'Jews run Hollywood.' The newspaper quite rightly said that to say 'the Jews run Hollywood' is an entirely different matter, one that smacks of anti-Semitism. So it concluded that 'No, 'the Jews' don't run Hollywood. But Jews do, just as Koreans predominate in New York dry-cleaning and blacks rule in basketball.'"<ref name=":0" />

===Bush holiday cards===
After [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] used the term "Holidays" instead of "Christmas" on the [[White House]] 2005 Christmas cards, Donohue stated "The Bush administration has suffered a loss of will and … they have capitulated to the worst elements in our culture."<ref>Davis, Matthew [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4512156.stm Lines drawn in battle over Christmas], [[BBC News]], December 10, 2005</ref>

===Michael Savage===
"I was scheduled to be on with [[Michael Savage (commentator)|Mike Savage]] the day he savaged the Catholic Church and made bigoted comments about Latinos", Donohue said.

"But in the pre-interview – which occurred just a half hour before Savage went ballistic – I let a producer know that I did not share the host's position; after he checked with Savage, I was told they would not have me on the show. That was fine, but what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom.' He owes all Catholics an apology."<ref>[https://archive.today/20120910220924/http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/4/3/162352.shtml Savage Remarks Anger Catholics], ''[[NewsMax.com]]'', April 3, 2006</ref>

===John Edwards campaign staffers===
Donohue demanded that former Sen. [[John Edwards]] fire two [[John Edwards presidential campaign, 2008|presidential campaign]] staffers in February 2007, charging that they were "anti-Catholic, vulgar, trash-talking bigots." He cited a blog written by [[Amanda Marcotte]] regarding the Church's opposition to [[birth control]], saying it forces women "to bear more tithing Catholics". He also cited another posting called "Pope and Fascists". Donohue also objected to one of the staffers describing President Bush's "wingnut Christofacist base".

Donohue called the statements "incendiary" and "inflammatory", saying, "It's scurrilous and has no place being part of someone's resume who's going to work for a potential presidential contender." On February 8, John Edwards addressed the writings of the staffers, Amanda Marcotte and Melissa McEwan, saying "that kind of intolerant language will not be permitted from anyone on my campaign, whether it's intended as satire, humor or anything else."{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Donohue insisted that Edwards fire the pair immediately.

After the complaints, Marcotte wrote, "The Christian version of the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] is generally interpreted as super-patriarchal where God is viewed as so powerful he can impregnate without befouling himself by touching a woman, and women are nothing but vessels." After Marcotte parted with the campaign, Donohue stated, "It is not enough that one foul-mouthed anti-Christian bigot, Amanda Marcotte, has quit. Melissa McEwan must go as well. Either Edwards shows her the door or she bolts on her own. There is no third choice – the Catholic League will see to it that this issue won't go away." He continued, "The Edwards campaign is in total disarray and the meltdown will continue unless McEwan is removed from his staff. The fact that Marcotte had to quit suggests that Edwards doesn't have the guts to do what is morally right." McEwan resigned on February 13, 2007,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2007/02/announcement.html |title=Announcement |work=Shakespeare's Sister |last=McEwan |first=Melissa |accessdate=2007-04-03 |date=2007-02-13}}</ref> citing the hostility of the Catholic League and emails threatening [[rape]] and [[murder]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/melissa_mcewan/2007/02/my_life_as_a_rightwing_target.html |title=My life as a rightwing target |work=The Guardian |last=McEwan |first=Melissa |accessdate=2007-04-03 |date=2007-02-16 |quote=The truth is, being a firebrand of any political persuasion does not warrant rape and death threats. | location=London}}</ref>

===Kathy Griffin===
On September 8, 2007, [[Kathy Griffin]] won her first [[Emmy]] for season two of reality show ''[[Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List]]''. Griffin stirred up controversy with her acceptance speech, saying that "a lot of people come up here and thank Jesus for this award.

===''The Golden Compass''===
As part of a two-month protest campaign, Donohue called for a boycott of the film ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]'', believing that while the religious elements of the film would be "watered down" from the source novels, the film would still encourage children to read the series, which Donohue says "denigrates Christianity" and promotes "atheism for kids",<ref name="CL">{{cite web|url=http://catholicleague.org/catalyst.php?year=2007&month=October&read=2306 |title=Film Sells Atheism To Kids; Major Protest Launched |accessdate=2007-10-09 |date=October 9, 2007 |publisher=CatholicLeague.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011232717/http://catholicleague.org/catalyst.php?year=2007&month=October&read=2306 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}</ref> citing author [[Philip Pullman]] as saying that he is "trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief."<ref>{{cite news | author=Alona Wartofsky | title=The Last Word |newspaper=Washington Post |date= 2001-02-19 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A23371-2001Feb18?language=printer | accessdate=2007-10-17}}</ref> Donohue hopes that "the film [will fail] to meet box office expectations and that [Pullman's] books attract few buyers."<ref>{{cite news|author=Mary McSweeney |title=Catholic League condemns 'The Golden Compass' |newspaper=Washington Post |date=2007-10-13 |url=http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1365093.php/Catholic_League_condemns_The_Golden_Compass |accessdate=2007-10-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017030051/http://movies.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1365093.php/Catholic_League_condemns_The_Golden_Compass |archivedate=2007-10-17 }}</ref> The call for a boycott resulted in action by some Catholic groups in the US and Canada, and a Catholic school board in [[Ontario]] has ordered the source novel removed from its library shelves.

=== Eucharist incident ===
In July 2008, a controversy arose surrounding a [[Communion rite]] altercation involving Webster Cook, a student and member of the [[University of Central Florida]] (UCF) student senate. Cook attended a [[Catholic Mass]] on campus and was [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church#Receiving the Eucharist|given the Eucharist]] but [[Desecration of host|walked out without consuming it]]. This action was allegedly related to his protest of the use of public funds for organized worship in the student union hall. According to Donohue, Cook's actions were a form of desecration of the sacrament. Cook was proposed for censure by the student senate and was criticized by local media. He also received numerous death threats.<ref name=bodysnatch/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myfoxorlando.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail;jsessionid=912931E6387D06E86603288C86CA66A1?contentId=6932236&version=2&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=TSTY&pageId=1.1.1&sflg=1 |title= Student Who Took Religious Icon Getting Death Threats |accessdate=2008-07-11 |date=2008-07-07 |publisher= MY [[Fox News|Fox]] Orlando}}</ref>

=== Boycott of Roger Smith Hotel ===
In March 2007, a sculpture created by Italian-Canadian artist [[Cosimo Cavallaro]] was to be displayed at [[Manhattan]]'s [[Roger Smith Hotel]]. The sculpture, entitled "My Sweet Lord", was of a crucified Christ, nude, in molded chocolate. Although the artist says he is a practicing Catholic, Bill Donohue decried the work as "hate speech", "garbage", and "one of the worst assaults on Christian sensibilities ever,"<ref name="foxnews.com">{{Cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,262602,00.html |title="Display of Controversial 'Chocolate Jesus' Sculpture Cancelled" |access-date=2009-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920113119/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,262602,00.html |archive-date=2008-09-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> describing Mr. Cavallaro as a "loser artist" and telling him in a television interview on ''[[Anderson Cooper 360]]'', "You're lucky I'm not like the [[Taliban]], because you would lose more than your head."

Under the leadership of Donohue, the Catholic League organized a boycott of the hotel aimed at forcing it to remove the statue. The hotel's management stating that the protests "brought to our attention the unintended reaction of you and other conscientious friends", eventually agreed to the League's calls, prompting the curator of the gallery, Matt Semler, to resign in protest.<ref name="foxnews.com"/> Semler said the six-foot sculpture was the victim of "a strong-arming from people who haven't seen the show, seen what we're doing.

===Church child sex abuse issue===

Donohue said, in October 2009, that the Catholic Church has a "homosexual", not a "pedophilia", problem, citing the [[John Jay Report]].<ref>''The Advocate'': [http://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2009/10/16/donohue-gay-adoption-against-nature Donohue: Gay Adoption Against Nature.] October 16, 2009.</ref> The Catholic League has blamed the [[Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests]] (SNAP), for having "hired, hidden, defended, enabled, ignored and concealed the crimes of child molesters."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.catholicleague.org/snap-protects-child-molesters-2/ | work=Catholic League | title=SNAP Protects Child Molesters | date=2012-03-07 |  accessdate=2012-10-01}}</ref> The Catholic League defended attacking SNAP on the grounds that they were "a menace to the Catholic Church."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/13/us/catholic-church-pressures-victims-network-with-subpoenas.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Laurie | last=Goodstein | title=Catholic Church Puts Legal Pressure on Survivors' Network | date=2012-03-12}}</ref>

In a November 18, 2009, ''Politics Daily'' column about Smith's research, David Gibson reported that sexual identity should be "separated from the problem of sexual abuse," according to criminologist Margaret Smith. Smith said, "we do not find a connection between homosexual identity and an increased likelihood of sexual abuse."<ref name="Schulman">{{cite web|last1=Schulman|first1=Jeremy|title=Expert: Donohue's claim that most abusive priests are gay is 'unwarranted|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2010/04/02/expert-donohues-claim-that-most-abusive-priests/162640|website=Media Matters for America|accessdate=30 June 2017|date=2 April 2010}}</ref> Nevertheless, Donohue says that this is a homosexual problem in the Catholic Church and not a pedophile one.<ref name="Schulman" />

Donohue has been asked to respond to Smith's position many times.

====Irish Child Abuse Commission====
{{Main|Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse}}
On May 20, 2009, [[Reuters]] reported the results of a nine-year investigation by the [[Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse]], which looked into decades of endemic sexual abuse against children in Catholic-run reform schools in Ireland.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/05/20/uk-ireland-church-abuse-idUKTRE54J2JY20090520 |work=Reuters |title=Irish report says priests beat and raped children: Priests beat and raped children during decades of abuse in Catholic-run institutions in Ireland, an official report said on Wednesday, but it stopped short of naming the perpetrators |first1=Padraic |last1=Halpin |first2=Carmel |last2=Crimmins |date=May 20, 2009 |location=Dublin, Ireland |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref> In reaction to this report, popularly known as the Ryan Report, Donohue issued a statement downplaying the seriousness of the cases, questioning the inclusion of voyeurism and "inappropriate sexual talk" as instances of sexual abuse along with the more serious charge of rape.<ref name="Hysteria over Irish Clergy Abuse">[http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1616 "Hysteria over Irish Clergy Abuse"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525093341/http://www.catholicleague.org/release.php?id=1616 |date=May 25, 2009 }}</ref> Donohue said that rape constituted only 12% of the listed sexual abuse cases in the Ryan report, and that priests committed only 12% of the listed rapes – the other 88% were committed by lay persons and [[Brother (Catholic)|religious brothers]].<ref name="Hysteria over Irish Clergy Abuse"/>

Since the Ryan Report was released, Donohue has been defending the Church and saying that much of the outrage is "moral hysteria". While stating that he agrees that rape and physical abuse are wrong and that he would not defend those actions, he says the report has conflated these abuses with "lesser" forms of punishment and is therefore not as serious. He also says many of the purported forms of abuse found by the commission were present and acceptable in the time period.<ref name=thelastword/>
