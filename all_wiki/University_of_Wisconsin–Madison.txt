The '''University of Wisconsin–Madison''' (also known as '''University of Wisconsin''', '''Wisconsin''', '''UW''', '''UW–Madison''', or simply '''Madison''') is a [[public university|public]] [[Land-grant university|land-grant]] [[research university]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. Founded when [[Wisconsin]] achieved [[U.S. state|statehood]] in 1848, UW–Madison is the official state university of Wisconsin and the flagship campus of the [[University of Wisconsin System]]. It was the first public university established in Wisconsin and remains the oldest and largest public university in the state. It became a land-grant institution in 1866.<ref>[http://www.wisconsinidea.wisc.edu/timeline.html The Wisconsin Idea] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828081902/http://www.wisconsinidea.wisc.edu/timeline.html |date=August 28, 2008 }}</ref> The {{convert|933|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} main campus, located on the shores of [[Lake Mendota]], includes four [[National Historic Landmark]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=National Historic Landmarks Survey |publisher=National Park Service |url=https://www.nps.gov/nhl/find/statelists/wi/WI.pdf |access-date=March 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221210521/https://www.nps.gov/NHL/find/statelists/wi/WI.pdf |archive-date=February 21, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The university also owns and operates a historic [[University of Wisconsin–Madison Arboretum|{{convert|1200|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} arboretum]] established in 1932, located {{convert|4|miles}} south of the main campus.<ref>{{cite web |title=UW Arboretum |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison |url=https://arboretum.wisc.edu |access-date=December 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181210063239/https://arboretum.wisc.edu/ |archive-date=December 10, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The university had its official beginnings when the [[Wisconsin Territory|Wisconsin Territorial Legislature]] in its 1838 session passed a law incorporating a "'''University of the Territory of Wisconsin'''", and a high-ranking [[board of visitors|Board of Visitors]] was appointed. However, this body (the predecessor of the U.W. [[Governing boards of colleges and universities in the United States|board of regents]]) never actually accomplished anything before [[Wisconsin]] was incorporated as a state in 1848.<ref>[http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/WI.WIBlueBk1883 Heg, J.

A permanent campus site was soon selected: an area of {{convert|50|acre|ha|1}} "bounded north by Fourth lake, east by a street to be opened at right angles with King street", [later State Street] "south by Mineral Point Road (University Avenue), and west by a carriage-way from said road to the lake."

===The Wisconsin Idea===
Research, teaching, and service at the UW is influenced by a tradition known as "the [[Wisconsin Idea]]", first articulated by UW–Madison President [[Charles Van Hise]] in 1904, when he declared "I shall never be content until the beneficent influence of the University reaches every home in the state."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wisc.edu/wisconsin-idea/ |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison |title=The Wisconsin Idea |access-date=January 12, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102215322/https://www.wisc.edu/wisconsin-idea/ |archive-date=January 2, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Wisconsin Idea holds that the boundaries of the university should be the boundaries of the state, and that the research conducted at UW–Madison should be applied to solve problems and improve health, quality of life, the [[Natural environment|environment]], and agriculture for all citizens of the state. The Wisconsin Idea permeates the university's work and helps forge close working relationships among university faculty and students, and the state's industries and government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=580&search_term=Wisconsin+Idea |title=Dictionary of Wisconsin History: Wisconsin Idea |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society |access-date=January 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816073000/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=580&search_term=Wisconsin+Idea |archive-date=August 16, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based in Wisconsin's populist history, the Wisconsin Idea continues to inspire the work of the faculty, staff, and students who aim to solve real-world problems by working together across disciplines and demographics.<ref>Jack Stark.

===Expansion===
{{main|University of Wisconsin System}}
Over time, additional campuses were added to the university. The [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]] was created in 1956, and UW–Green Bay and UW–Parkside in 1968. Ten freshman-sophomore centers were also added to this system.<ref name=Wisconsin>[http://www.wisconsin.edu/about/history.htm History and Organization of the University of Wisconsin System] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202182105/http://www.wisconsin.edu/about/history.htm |date=February 2, 2007 }}. Retrieved on Feb, 18, 2007.</ref> In 1971, Wisconsin legislators passed a law merging the University of Wisconsin with the nine universities and four freshman-sophomore branch campuses of the [[University of Wisconsin System#Former Wisconsin State Universities|Wisconsin State Universities System]], creating the University of Wisconsin System and bringing the two higher education systems under a single board of regents.

[[File:1554 sterlingmarker.jpg|thumb|Historical marker near Sterling Hall commemorating fatal 1970 bombing]]
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, UW–Madison was shaken by a series of student protests, and by the use of force by authorities in response, comprehensively documented in the film ''[[The War at Home (1979 film)|The War at Home]]''. The first major demonstrations protested the presence on campus of [[recruitment|recruiters]] for the [[Dow Chemical]] Company, which supplied the [[napalm]] used in the [[Vietnam War]]. Authorities used force to quell the disturbance. The struggle was documented in the book, ''[[They Marched into Sunlight]]'',<ref>David Maraniss, ''They Marched into Sunlight: War and Peace Vietnam and America, October 1967''(New York: Simon & Schuster, 2003)</ref> as well as the PBS documentary ''[[Two Days in October]]''.<ref>PBS Film, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/twodays/ "Two Days in October,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212115301/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/twodays/ |date=February 12, 2017 }}, aired on October 17, 2005.</ref> Among the students injured in the protest was former Madison mayor [[Paul Soglin]].

Another target of protest was the Army Mathematics Research Center (AMRC) in Sterling Hall, which was also home of the physics department. The student newspaper, ''[[The Daily Cardinal]]'', published a series of investigative articles stating that AMRC was pursuing research directly pursuant to [[US Department of Defense]] requests, and supportive of military operations in Vietnam. AMRC became a magnet for demonstrations, in which protesters chanted "U.S. out of Vietnam! Smash Army Math!"

On August 24, 1970, near 3:40&nbsp;am, a bomb exploded next to Sterling Hall, aimed at destroying the Army Math Research Center.<ref name="Stucki">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/4/2006_4_69.shtml Heinz Stucki] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203162921/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/4/2006_4_69.shtml |date=December 3, 2008 }} "Army Math: A Home Grown Terrorist Bombing," ''American Heritage'', Aug./Sept. 2006.</ref> Despite the late hour, a [[Postdoctoral researcher|post doctoral physics researcher]], [[Robert Fassnacht]], was in the lab and was killed in the explosion. The physics department was severely damaged, while the intended target, the AMRC, was scarcely affected. [[Karleton Armstrong]], [[Dwight Armstrong]], and [[David Fine (activist)|David Fine]] were found responsible for the blast. [[Leo Burt]] was identified as a suspect, but was never apprehended or tried.<ref>Tom Bates, ''Rads: The 1970 Bombing of the Army Math Research Center at the University of Wisconsin and Its Aftermath'' (New York: Harper, 1993).</ref>

===College of Agriculture and Life Sciences===
The [[University of Wisconsin–Madison College of Agricultural and Life Sciences|College of Agricultural and Life Sciences]] fulfills the UW–Madison's mission as a land-grant university, which dates back to 1862, when Congress passed legislation to establish a national network of colleges devoted to agriculture and mechanics and Wisconsin received 240,000 acres of allotted federal land.<ref name="cals.wisc.edu">[http://www.cals.wisc.edu/about-cals/history/ History | College of Agricultural and Life Sciences – University of Wisconsin–Madison] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609024518/http://www.cals.wisc.edu/about-cals/history/ |date=June 9, 2013 }}. Cals.wisc.edu. Retrieved on 2013-08-17.</ref> In 1885 the university began offering a winter course for farmers, the Agriculture Short Course, which was greatly developed and enhanced by [[Ransom Asa Moore]] from 1895 until 1907 and continues today as the Farm and Industry Short Course. In 1889 the university put all of their agricultural offerings under a new College of Agriculture, with W.A. Henry as dean.<ref name="cals.wisc.edu"/> Professors listed in the 1896 Agricultural Short Course for the College of Agriculture at the University of Wisconsin–Madison listed popular professors such the Dean of the College of Agriculture, W.A.

==Campus==
[[File:Aeroplane view of University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin (64127).jpg|thumb|Overhead view of central campus in the 1920s]]
Located in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], about a mile from the [[Wisconsin State Capitol|state capitol]], the main campus of the university is situated partially on [[Madison Isthmus|the isthmus]] between [[Lake Mendota]] and [[Lake Monona]]. The main campus comprises {{convert|933|acre|ha|0}} of land, while the entire campus, including research stations throughout the state, is over {{convert|10600|acre|ha|0}} in area. The central campus is on an urban layout mostly coinciding with the city of Madison's street grid, exceptions being the suburban [[University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics]], and the Department of Psychiatry & Clinics in the West Side research park. The [[University of Wisconsin–Madison Arboretum]], a demonstration area for native ecosystems, is located on the west side of Madison. The main campus includes many buildings designed or supervised by architects [[J.T.W. Jennings]] and [[Arthur Peabody]]. The hub of campus life is the [[Memorial Union (Wisconsin)|Memorial Union]]. UW–Madison's campus has been ranked as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States by ''[[Travel + Leisure]]'' and ''[[Condé Nast Traveler]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses |title="America's most beautiful college campuses", ''Travel + Leisure'' (August, 2018) |access-date=June 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608184511/https://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses |archive-date=June 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2016-01-29/the-20-most-beautiful-college-campuses-in-america |title="The 50 Most Beautiful College Campuses in America", ''Condé Nast Traveler'' (August 6, 2018) |access-date=June 8, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608184521/https://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2016-01-29/the-20-most-beautiful-college-campuses-in-america |archive-date=June 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The UW–Madison has its own police force, food service, hospital, [[recreation]] facilities, botanical gardens, [[List of public art in Madison, Wisconsin|public artworks]], power facilities, and an on-campus dairy plant.

===Bascom Hall===
[[File:BascomHill.JPG|thumb|Bascom Hall atop Bascom Hill at the heart of the campus]]
As one of the icons on campus, Bascom Hall,<ref>{{cite web | title=Bascom Hall Home Page | publisher=UW–Madison | url=http://www.bascom.wisc.edu/ | access-date=January 19, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103185308/http://www.bascom.wisc.edu/ | archive-date=November 3, 2007 | url-status=live }}</ref> at the top of [[Bascom Hill]], is often considered the "heart of the campus." Built in 1857, a decorative dome that once sat atop the structure was destroyed by fire in 1916. The structure has been added to several times over the years. The building currently houses the office of the [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] and vice chancellors. Bascom Hall is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a contributing building within the Bascom Hill Historic District.<ref>{{cite web | title=National Register of Historic Places | publisher=National Register of Historic Places | url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/ | access-date=January 19, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120161120/http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/ | archive-date=January 20, 2007 | url-status=live }}</ref> 

===Music Hall===
[[File:Musichall.jpg|thumb|right|Music Hall]]
[[File:Aoss building.jpg|thumb|A photo of the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences building on UW's campus.]]
This [[Victorian Gothic]] building, built in 1878 and initially named Assembly Hall, was designed to house an 800-seat [[auditorium]], a library, and a [[clock tower]]. Dedicated on March 2, 1880, the building originally held [[convention (meeting)|conventions]], dances, and [[graduation|commencement ceremonies]], along with its primary purpose of a library. After the library moved to a different building on campus, a portion of the hall was assigned to the School of Music in 1900. Shortly after renovations in the early 1900s, the building was officially named Music Hall in 1910. It remains an important music venue and is home to the university opera.<ref>{{cite web | title=Music Hall| publisher=Mills Music Library| url=http://music.library.wisc.edu/geninfo/mushall.htm | access-date=January 20, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060828165629/http://music.library.wisc.edu/geninfo/mushall.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = August 28, 2006}}</ref> This building also is home to the Department of [[Urban and Regional Planning]], with part of the building being used as office space and classrooms.

===George L. Mosse Humanities Building===
The [[George Mosse|George L. Mosse]] Humanities Building, located on Library Mall, was built in the late 1960s in the [[Brutalist]] style. Although debunked, the campus myth is that the building (with its poor ventilation, narrow windows, inclined base, and cantilevered upper floors) was designed to be "riot-proof".<ref>Aaron Hathaway.

===Van Hise Hall===
[[File:Vanhisehall.jpg|thumb|Van Hise Hall seen from Linden Drive]]
Van Hise Hall is home to most of the languages departments of the university<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fpm.wisc.edu/smomap/building.aspx?building=0482 |title=University of Wisconsin-Madison Buildings |publisher=Fpm.wisc.edu |access-date=March 11, 2012}}</ref> and the upper floors house the offices of the University of Wisconsin System's president and its Board of Regents.

===Grainger Hall===
[[File:Graingerhall.jpg|thumb|Grainger Business Hall and Conference center]]
Home of the Wisconsin School of Business, Grainger Hall was built in 1993. In 2008 it underwent a major renovation and addition to assist the 12 MBA specialization programs that were housed there.<ref>{{cite news |last=Perez |first=Erica |title=Wisconsin School of Business' Grainger Hall addition almost done |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=778298 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130127003134/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=778298 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 27, 2013 |access-date=January 29, 2009 |date=July 31, 2008 }}</ref> The addition occupies the corner of Park Street and University Avenue, projecting the school's crest outward in a location that once housed a bank.<ref>{{cite web |last=Perez |first=Erica |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=778298 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130127003134/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=778298 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 27, 2013 |title=Wisconsin School of Business' Grainger Hall addition almost done |publisher=JSOnline |date=July 31, 2008 |access-date=September 10, 2010 }}</ref>

Grainger Hall also houses an array of student-run organizations, both undergraduate and graduate. There are major-specific organizations as well as organizations that welcome all students. Several of the clubs are Madison chapters of nationwide organizations, others are honor societies that require a minimum grade point average, while some exist simply to network with other students.

===The Wisconsin Union===
[[File:Memorial Union and quadrangle.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Memorial Union (Wisconsin)|Memorial Union]] as seen from the Library Mall on the UW–Madison campus]]

The University of Wisconsin–Madison has two [[Student activity center|student unions]]. The older, [[Memorial Union (Wisconsin)|Memorial Union]], was built in 1928 to honor American World War I [[veteran]]s. Also known as the Union or the Terrace, it has gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful [[student activity center|student centers]] on a university campus. Located on the shore of [[Lake Mendota]], it is a popular spot for socializing among both students and the public, who enjoy gazing at the lake and its sailboats. The union is known for the [[Rathskeller]], a German pub adjacent to the lake terrace. Political debates and [[backgammon]] and [[sheepshead (game)|sheepshead]] games over a beer on the terrace are common among students. The Rathskeller serves "Rathskeller Ale", a beer brewed expressly for the Terrace. Memorial Union was the first union at a public university to serve beer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.union.wisc.edu/history/1933.html |title=Wisconsin Union History |access-date=September 17, 2008 |date=May 8, 2006 |publisher=The Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807172306/http://www.union.wisc.edu/history/1933.html |archive-date=August 7, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

[[File:Lake Mendota Madison, WI.jpg|thumb|Hoofer Badger Sloops on Lake Mendota behind Memorial Union]]
Memorial Union is home to many arts venues, including several art galleries, a movie theater, the Wisconsin Union Theater, and a craft shop that provides courses and facilities for arts and crafts activities. Students and Madison community members alike congregate at the Memorial Union for the films and concerts each week. An advisory [[referendum]] to [[Renovation|renovate]] and expand Memorial Union was approved by the student body in 2006, and the university is currently undergoing the expansion.<ref>{{cite web | title=Memorial Union | publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison | url=https://union.wisc.edu/visit/memorial-union/ | access-date=January 12, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111184846/https://union.wisc.edu/visit/memorial-union/ | archive-date=January 11, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Union South, the newer campus union, was built in 1971 to better accommodate a growing student enrollment and was demolished in 2008. A new "green" Union South, located on the site of the old union, opened April 15, 2011. It is a certified [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) gold building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newunion.wisc.edu/sustainability.html |title=Sustainability – New Union South |publisher=Newunion.wisc.edu |access-date=March 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314121515/http://newunion.wisc.edu/sustainability.html |archive-date=March 14, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The building contains several dining options, an art gallery, a climbing wall, a bowling alley, event spaces, and a hotel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newunion.wisc.edu/index.html |title=New South Campus Union |publisher=Newunion.wisc.edu |date=April 15, 2011 |access-date=March 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314121711/http://newunion.wisc.edu/index.html |archive-date=March 14, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.union.wisc.edu/visit-unionsouth.htm |title=Union South – Wisconsin Union |publisher=Union.wisc.edu |access-date=March 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311215105/http://www.union.wisc.edu/visit-unionsouth.htm |archive-date=March 11, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Wisconsin Union]] also provides a home for the Wisconsin Union Directorate Student Programming Board (WUD), which provides regular programs for both students and community members. One of the most well-known members of WUD is the [[Wisconsin Hoofers]], a club that organizes outdoor recreational activities.<ref>{{cite web |last=Butts |first=Porter |title=Wisconsin Hoofers, An Early History |url=http://hoofers.org/historyoral |access-date=February 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308143045/http://hoofers.org/historyoral |archive-date=March 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Dejope Hall===
[[File:Dejope Hall-front.JPG|thumb|right|Dejope Residence Hall]]
On May 22, 2012, the [[Ho-Chunk Nation of Wisconsin]] passed a resolution permitting the usage of the name "Dejope" for a new residence hall at the university. ''Dejope'' means "Four Lakes" in the Ho-Chunk language, and Native Americans have used this word to describe the Madison area for thousands of years.<ref>[http://www.housing.wisc.edu/dejope Dejope Residence Hall] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209033424/http://www.housing.wisc.edu/dejope |date=December 9, 2012 }} Retrieved on December 2, 2012</ref> The residence hall was planned as a symbol of the ongoing cooperative relationship between University of Wisconsin–Madison and the Ho-Chunk nation and the building and its grounds contain imagery of the mounds and lakes in the area. A fire circle in front of the building contains plaques representing all 11 Native American nations in Wisconsin. Images of the four effigy mounds that are located on the campus (Observatory Hill, Willow Drive, Picnic Point and Eagle Heights) are embedded into the flooring of the building's main floor. An acrylic depiction of Lake Mendota is located in the conference room, and another artwork of glass and metal depicting the Four Lakes is located in the East Hall.

===DeLuca Biochemistry Building===
The [[DeLuca Biochemistry Building|Hector F. DeLuca Biochemistry Building]], part of the Hector F. DeLuca Complex, was built in 1912 and was extensively remodeled in 2012. The building is home to floor-to-ceiling murals painted by [[John Steuart Curry]]. Home to the Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, the building also includes Department of Biochemistry facilities.

=== Chadbourne Residence Hall ===
Chadbourne Residence Hall was constructed in 1959, with major renovations ranging from 2007 to 2010. Chadboune, also known as CRC, has a building-wide living learning community. CRC is connected to Rheta's dining hall.

===Mascot===
{{main|Bucky Badger}}
The school mascot is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] [[badger]] named [[Bucky Badger|Bucky]] who dons a sweater affixed with the UW–Madison athletic logo (currently the red "Motion W"). Beginning in 1890, the university's first Bucky Badger was a live, temperamental and unruly [[badger]] who was quickly retired. Although the nickname of the Wisconsin teams remained the "Badgers", it was not until Art Evans drew the early caricature version of Bucky in 1940 that today's recognizable image of Bucky was adopted. In 1949, a contest was held to name the mascot, but no consensus was reached after only a few entries were received. In reaction, the contest committee chose the name Buckingham U. Badger, or "Bucky", for short.

At Wisconsin football games in the 1920s live mascots were used to inspire fans. The animals used included a black bear, a bonnet monkey, and live badgers. 1949 was the first year a student sporting a papier-mâché badger head appeared; this subsequently replaced the use of live badgers.<ref>Arthur Hove. [http://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/0099.htm ''The University of Wisconsin: A Pictorial History.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309055952/http://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/0099.htm |date=March 9, 2015 }}, University of Wisconsin Press, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-299-13000-8}}</ref>

The team's nickname originates from the [[List of U.S. state nicknames|state nickname]]. In the 1820s, many lead miners and their families lived in the mines in which they worked until adequate above-ground shelters were built, and thus were compared to badgers.<ref>{{cite web| title = Badger Notables: Badger Nickname| publisher = UWBadgers.com – The Official Web Site of Badger Athletics|url=http://www.uwbadgers.com/traditions/notables_120.html|access-date=October 22, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112063315/http://www.uwbadgers.com/traditions/notables_120.html |archive-date = November 12, 2006}}</ref>

In 2009, Fulton Market Films produced the documentary ''Being Bucky'' which followed the lives of seven Wisconsin students who take on the role of Bucky Badger.<ref>{{IMDb title|1509737|Being Bucky (2009)}}</ref> ''Being Bucky'' won "Best Documentary Film" at the [[Wisconsin Film Festival]] and went on to play in local Wisconsin movie theaters.<ref>[http://www.beingbucky.com A buckumentary about being a mascot] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512171314/http://www.beingbucky.com/ |date=May 12, 2009 }}.

====Campus radio====
The University of Wisconsin–Madison campus radio station is [[WSUM]] 91.7 FM, "The Snake on the Lake".<ref>{{cite web|title=WSUM|publisher=WSUM.org|url=http://www.wsum.org|access-date=January 20, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070201211310/http://wsum.org/|archive-date=February 1, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> Historically, UW–Madison has been home to a collection of student run radio stations, a number of which stopped broadcasting after run-ins with the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). The current radio station, WSUM, began in 1997 in a [[webcast]] only format because of the prolonged battle to get an FCC license and construct a tower. This lasted five years until February 22, 2002, when the station started broadcasting over [[frequency modulation|FM]] airwaves at 91.7 from its tower in [[Montrose, Wisconsin]]. The radio station currently has around 200 volunteer DJs and eight paid managers. All UW–Madison students, as well as a limited number of community members, are eligible to participate in running the station. WSUM remains entirely free format, which means that the on-air personnel can showcase a large variety of music and talk programming at their discretion with few limitations. WSUM has garnered many awards from the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association for their news, play-by-play broadcasts of Badger athletic events, and unique [[public service announcements]].<ref>"Free-spirited Radio Shows", ''Wisconsin State Journal'', February 22, 2007, p.
