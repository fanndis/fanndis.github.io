The band currently consists of Del Naja, Thaws and Marshall, with [[Shara Nelson]] and [[Horace Andy]] as guest vocalists. 

The debut Massive Attack album ''[[Blue Lines]]'' was released in 1991, with the single "[[Unfinished Sympathy]]" reaching the charts and later being voted the 63rd greatest song of all time in a poll by ''[[NME]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-100-1/330996/37/1|title= The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: 63.

==History==
DJs Daddy G and Andrew Vowles and [[graffiti]] artist-turned-[[rapping|rapper]] Robert Del Naja met as members of partying collective [[The Wild Bunch (sound system)|the Wild Bunch]]. One of the first homegrown [[Sound system (DJ)|soundsystems]] in the UK, the Wild Bunch became dominant on the Bristol club scene in the mid-1980s.<ref name="auto"/>

Massive Attack started as a spin-off production trio in 1988, with the [[Independent music|independently]] released song, "Any Love", sung by [[falsetto]]-voiced singer-songwriter Carlton McCarthy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Carlton|title=Carlton Discography|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref> and then, with considerable backing from [[Neneh Cherry]], they signed to Circa Records<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4629212-1.html |title=Virgin Anniversary Salute: The U.S.: Co-presidents Cooper And Newton Are An Illustrious Pair Who Travel Well And Know Their Places |publisher=Billboard (as found at allbusiness.com) |date=5 September 1998 |accessdate=26 May 2009 |last=Henderson |first=Richard |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827221134/http://www.allbusiness.com/retail-trade/miscellaneous-retail-retail-stores-not/4629212-1.html |archive-date=27 August 2010 }}</ref> in 1990—committing to deliver six studio albums and a "best of" [[compilation album|compilation]]. Circa became a subsidiary of, and was later subsumed into, [[Virgin Records]], which in turn was acquired by [[EMI]].<ref name=allmusicbio>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/massive-attack-mn0000378288/biography|title=Massive Attack &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=timedigital>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/digital/cyberelite/39.html |title=Cyber Elite&nbsp;– Massive Attack |publisher=Time Digital |accessdate=20 May 2009 |date=5 October 1998 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327033621/http://www.time.com/time/digital/cyberelite/39.html |archive-date=27 March 2010 }}</ref> ''Blue Lines'' (1991), was co-produced by [[Jonny Dollar]] and [[Cameron McVey]], who also became their first manager.<ref name=brandplayson>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/14/1044927795994.html|title=The brand plays on|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=15 February 2003|accessdate=20 May 2009}}</ref> McVey (credited at the time as 'Booga Bear') and his wife, Neneh Cherry, provided crucial financial support and in-kind assistance to the early careers of Massive Attack, Portishead and [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] during this period, even paying regular wages to them through their ''Cherry Bear Organisation''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://67.222.54.247/33//2007/01/interview-with-cameron-booga-bear-mcvey.html|title=Interview with Cameron 'Booga Bear' McVey|publisher=Reseize|date=15 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705234710/http://67.222.54.247/33//2007/01/interview-with-cameron-booga-bear-mcvey.html|archive-date=5 July 2011}}</ref> Massive Attack used guest vocalists, interspersed with Del Naja and Marshall's (initially Tricky's) own ''[[sprechgesang]]'' stylings, on top of what became regarded as an essentially British creative sampling production; a trademark sound that fused down-tempo [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[soul music|soul]], [[reggae]] and other eclectic references, musical and lyrical.<ref name=allmusicbio/>

In the 1990s, the trio became known for working increasingly separately. [[Andrew Vowles]] (Mushroom) left Massive Attack in late 1999. Despite having taken Del Naja's side and participating in a webcast as a duo the following year, Grant Marshall (Daddy G) took a personal break in 2001. Marshall rejoined the band for their following tour in 2003 and 2004,<ref name=lynskey>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/feb/06/popandrock.features11|title=Massive Attack talk to Dorian Lynskey|work=The Guardian|date=6 February 2007|accessdate=20 May 2009|last=Lynskey|first=Dorian| location=London}}</ref> and returned to a studio role in 2005.

The album used vocalists including [[Horace Andy]] and [[Shara Nelson]], a former Wild Bunch cohort.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://humag.co/features/massive-attack|title=Features|website=Humag.co|accessdate=25 November 2020}}</ref> MC's Tricky and Willie Wee, also once part of the Wild Bunch, featured, as well as Daddy G's voice on "Five Man Army".

That year they released "[[Unfinished Sympathy]]" as a single, a string-arranged track at [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]] studio, scored by [[Will Malone]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/artists/andrea-parker|title=Andrea Parker|work=NME|quote=Will Malone, who had worked on horror film soundtracks and Massive Attack's classic "Unfinished Sympathy".|accessdate=22 May 2009}}</ref> that went on to be voted the 10th greatest song of all time in a poll by ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/nov/08/millennium.uk1|title=How Robbie headed Amadeus in the race to be music's man of the millennium|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 November 1999|quote=Best song: 10.

The group temporarily shortened their name to "Massive" on the advice of McVey to avoid controversy relating to the [[Gulf War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/whatson/unfinishedsympathy.shtml|title=BBC&nbsp;– Radio 2&nbsp;– Sold on Song&nbsp;– Brits25&nbsp;– Unfinished Sympathy|publisher=BBC|quote=Reaching number thirteen in the UK in 1991, Unfinished Sympathy was released under the group name Massive, due to the Gulf War of the same year|accessdate=22 May 2009}}</ref> They went back to being "Massive Attack" for their next single, "[[Safe from Harm (song)|Safe from Harm]]".

===''Protection'' and Melankolic===
{{Main|Protection (Massive Attack album)}}
After Shara Nelson left, the band brought in [[Everything but the Girl]]'s [[Tracey Thorn]]<ref name="allmusicbio" /> and Nicolette as vocalists and released "Protection" on 26 September 1994.

With McVey out of the picture, Massive Attack enlisted the production talents of former Wild Bunch [[Nellee Hooper]] to co-produce some songs on it, with Mushroom. Other tracks were co-produced by [[the Insects]] and 3D. A dub version, ''[[No Protection (Massive Attack album)|No Protection]]'', was released the following year by [[Mad Professor]]. ''Protection'' won a [[Brit Awards|Brit award]] for Best Dance Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/massive_attack/|title=Massive Attack presented in Music section|website=Newsfinder.org|accessdate=22 May 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605081654/http://www.newsfinder.org/site/more/massive_attack/|archive-date=5 June 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> The other collaborators on ''Protection'' were [[Marius de Vries]], [[Craig Armstrong (composer)|Craig Armstrong]],<ref name="lynskey" /> a Scottish classical pianist, and Tricky. Tricky's solo career was taking off at this time and he decided not to collaborate with Massive Attack after this.<ref name="allmusicbio" />

1994/1995 was also the period of Portishead's ''[[Dummy (album)|Dummy]]'' and Tricky's ''[[Maxinquaye]]'' albums and the term "trip hop" was coined.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/28/arts/pop-view-another-city-another-new-sound.html|title=POP VIEW; Another City, Another New Sound|work=The New York Times|date=28 May 1995|accessdate=22 May 2009|last=Reynolds|first=Simon}}</ref> The media started to refer to the "Bristol scene".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/maryannehobbs/bristol.shtml|title=Bristol: Rise Up|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 May 2009|last=Slinger|first=Benjamin}}</ref>

In 1995, Massive Attack started a label distributed by Virgin/EMI, Melankolic, and signed Craig Armstrong and a number of other artists such as Horace Andy, [[Alpha (band)|Alpha]], [[Sunna (band)|Sunna]], and [[Day One (band)|Day One]]. The trio espoused a non-interference philosophy that allowed the artists to make their albums in the way they wanted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://melankolic.astralwerks.com/ |title=This is melankolic records (archived at web.archive.org)|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=22 May 2009|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20030210154818/http://melankolic.astralwerks.com/ |archive-date = 10 February 2003}}</ref>

The same year the Insects became unavailable for co-production and having parted ways with Nellee Hooper, the band were introduced to [[Neil Davidge]],<ref name="bbcinterview">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A963542|title=BBC&nbsp;– collective&nbsp;– Massive Attack interview transcript part 3|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 May 2009}}</ref> a relatively unknown producer whose main claim to fame thus far had been an association with anonymous dance-pop outfit [[The DNA Disciples|DNA]]. The first track they worked on was "The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game", a cover version sung by Tracey Thorn for the [[Batman Forever (soundtrack)|''Batman Forever'' soundtrack]]. Initially, Davidge was brought in as engineer, but soon became producer.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Humberstone |first1=Nigel |title=Neil Davidge: Recording 100th Window |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/neil-davidge-recording-100th-window |magazine=Sound on Sound |accessdate=15 July 2018}}</ref>

The trio increasingly fractured in the lead-up to the third album, Davidge having to co-produce the three producers' ideas separately. Mushroom was reported to be unhappy with the degree of the post-punk direction in which Del Naja, increasingly filling the production vacuum, was taking the band.<ref name="bbcinterview" />

In 1997, the group contributed to the ''[[The Jackal (soundtrack)|film soundtrack]]'' of ''[[The Jackal (1997 film)|The Jackal]]'', recording "Superpredators (Metal Postcard)", a song containing a sample of [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]' "[[Mittageisen]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inflightdata.com/superpredators.html|title=Massive Attack|website=Inflightdata.com|accessdate=17 September 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713030438/http://www.inflightdata.com/superpredators.html|archive-date=13 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and "Dissolved Girl", a new song with vocals by Sarah Jay (that was later remixed for the next album), which was featured at the beginning of the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]'', although it was not on the official soundtrack.

Later that year they released a single, "[[Risingson]]", from what would be their third album, ''[[Mezzanine (album)|Mezzanine]]''.<ref name="allmusic-mezzanine">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r348738|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic ((( Mezzanine > Overview )))|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=22 May 2009|last=Bush|first=John}}</ref>

===''Mezzanine'', "Teardrop", Vowles's departure and Marshall's absence===
{{Main|Mezzanine (album)}}
In 1997, Del Naja became the band's main producer in the recording sessions that made Mezzanine, Massive Attack's most commercially successful album,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/40387/1/massive-attack-mezzanine-20th-birthday-retrospective|title=Massive Attack’s Mezzanine and the death of the multicultural dream|date=16 June 2018|website=Dazeddigital.com|accessdate=25 November 2020}}</ref> selling nearly four million copies, with Neil Davidge as a sound engineer and co-producer, [[Horace Andy]] and [[Elizabeth Fraser]] as the main guest vocalists.

''Mezzanine'' was Massive Attack's most commercially successful album, selling nearly 4 million copies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/40387/1/massive-attack-mezzanine-20th-birthday-retrospective|title=Massive Attack’s Mezzanine and the death of the multicultural dream|date=16 June 2018|website=Dazeddigital.com|accessdate=25 November 2020}}</ref> [[Angelo Bruschini]] became their permanent lead guitarist both in the studio and live.<ref name="allmusic-mezzanine" />

The lead single, after "Risingson" was "[[Teardrop (Massive Attack song)|Teardrop]]", sung by [[Elizabeth Fraser]] of [[Cocteau Twins]]. The song was accompanied by a video directed by [[Walter Stern (director)|Walter Stern]], of an [[animatronic]] singing fetus. Horace Andy sang on three songs, including "[[Angel (Massive Attack song)|Angel]]" and a track the band made for the film ''[[The Jackal (1997 film)|The Jackal]],'' "Dissolved Girl", sung by Sarah Jay, was remixed for inclusion on the record.

''Mezzanine'' went on to win a [[Q Awards|Q Award]] for Best Album<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/awardq.html|title=The Q Awards|website=Everyhit.com|accessdate=22 May 2009}}</ref> as well as being nominated for a [[Mercury Prize]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=NME|accessdate=2019-02-17|title=MERCURY RISING: GOMEZ WIN '98 ALBUM PRIZE|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/gomez-46-1385994|date=17 August 1998|website=NME}}</ref>

Touring extensively, friction between Mushroom and the others came to a head. Mushroom was unhappy with the direction of the group and having to appear on tour.<ref name="sawyer">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/may/11/urbanmusic.culture|title=Massive Attack talk to Miranda Sawyer|work=The Observer|date=11 May 2008|accessdate=20 May 2009|last=Sawyer|first=Miranda| location=London}}</ref>

Around this time, Del Naja, with Davidge decamped into Ridge Farm studio with friends and band members of [[Lupine Howl]] (made up of former members of the band [[Spiritualized]], including Damon Reece who went on to be Massive Attack's permanent drummer and one of two live drummers) towards a fourth Massive Attack LP, taking things even further into a rock direction.<ref name="brandplayson" />

2001 also saw the release of ''Eleven Promos,'' a DVD of all Massive Attack's 11 music videos thus far, including "Angel", a £100,000+ promo<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1215456|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic ((( Collected/Rarities/Eleven Promos > Overview )))|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=22 May 2009|last=Jurek|first=Thom}}</ref>

[[File:Daddy g.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Daddy G|Grant Marshall]] at the [[Eurockéennes]] Festival 2008]]
With Daddy G temporarily no longer involved in the studio, Davidge and Del Naja steered "LP4" on their own. Enlisting the vocals of [[Sinéad O'Connor]] and Horace Andy, ''100th Window'' was mastered in August 2002 and released in February 2003.<ref name=allmusic100thwindow>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r620022|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic ((( 100th Window > Overview )))|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=22 May 2009|last=Bush|first=John}}</ref>

Featuring no samples or cover versions, ''100th Window'' was not as critically well received in Britain as the other records, although the album received a warmer reception internationally; scoring a 75 out of 100 on review aggregation site [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/massiveattack/100thwindow?q=massive%20attack|title=100th Window|website=Metacritic.com|accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref> 

The group collaborated with [[Mos Def]] on the track "I Against I", which appeared on the "Special Cases" single and the soundtrack for ''[[Blade II]].'' "I Against I" is also notable as the only track from the ''100th Window'' sessions that features a writing credit from Daddy G.

Also in 2003, Del Naja was arrested on child porn allegations, which were reported widely in the media.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/feb/27/arts.childprotection|title=Police question musician over child porn|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 February 2003|accessdate=22 May 2009| location=London}}</ref> Del Naja was soon eliminated as a suspect<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/22/1047749989803.html|title=Police clear Massive Attack star in child porn inquiry|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 March 2003|accessdate=22 May 2009|last1=Barnes|first1=Anthony|last2=Marshall|first2=Nina}}</ref> (although he was charged with ecstasy possession and unable to get a U.S. visa for a while) with Daddy G and fans proffering their support. The arrest affected the beginning of the ''100th Window'' tour schedule.

''100th Window'' sold over a million copies and was toured extensively (including Queen Square, Bristol—a one-off sell out concert set up in the city centre park, which was seen as a homecoming).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/goingout/2003/08/26/massive_review.shtml|title=BBC&nbsp;– Going Out in Bristol&nbsp;– Massive Attack wow home crowd|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 May 2009}}</ref>

Afterwards, Del Naja and Davidge agreed to an offer from director [[Louis Leterrier]], to score the entire soundtrack for ''[[Unleashed (2005 film)|Danny the Dog]],'' starring [[Jet Li]]. [[Dot Allison]], who had sung with the band on the ''100th Window'' tour, sang the end titles track, "Aftersun". Del Naja and Davidge also scored the soundtrack for the ''[[Bullet Boy]]'' film, with Del Naja on the end titles' vocals.

In 2005, Daddy G started coming into the studio, although little came of the material. He decided to instead work with a production duo, Robot Club, in another studio, feeling that he would be more free to develop tracks in the way he wanted. Meanwhile, Del Naja and Davidge recorded with a number of different singers as well as creating a track named "Twilight", for [[UNKLE]]'s ''[[War Stories (album)|War Stories]]'' album. Later that year, Massive Attack decided to release their contractually obliged compilation album ''[[Collected (Massive Attack album)|Collected]]'' in 2006. They released it with a second disc, made up of previously released non-album songs and unreleased sketches.<ref name=allmusic100thwindow/>

==="Weather Underground" / ''Heligoland'' era===
{{Main|Heligoland (album)}}
In 2007, Del Naja and Davidge scored three soundtracks, ''In Prison My Whole Life'' (which featured a track called "Calling Mumia" with vocals by American rapper [[Snoop Dogg]]), ''[[Battle in Seattle]]'' and ''[[Trouble the Water]].''

In February 2007, Massive Attack hosted a charity benefit for the Hoping Foundation, a charity for [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] children. In 2008, it was announced that Massive Attack were to curate the UK's Southbank [[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown]], a week-long event. It was suggested in interviews that this event would inspire Massive Attack back into action, having spent several years drifting towards the completion of their fifth studio album.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/15/news.uk|title=Meltdown launches Massive Attack as festival curators|work=The Guardian|date=15 February 2008|accessdate=22 May 2009|last=Gibson|first=Owen|location=London}}</ref>

Later that year, Del Naja and Daddy G headed to [[Damon Albarn]]'s studios for some writing and jamming. Around this time, Davidge scored the soundtrack for a [[Paul McGuigan (filmmaker)|Paul McGuigan]] film, ''[[Push (2009 film)|Push]]'' and in December, Del Naja completed the score for ''[[44 Inch Chest]]'' with the Insects and [[Angelo Badalamenti]].

Davidge and Del Naja got back together in 2009 with Daddy G to finish the fifth album, incorporating bits of the Albarn material. Later it was announced that the band were to headline the 2009 [[Bestival]] festival,<ref>{{cite news|title=Kraftwork, Massive Attack to Headline Bestival|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/49591/kraftwerk-massive-attack-to-headline-bestival|work=Gigwise|accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref> and soon after that they were to tour the UK and Europe. In May, Robert Del Naja's instrumental "Herculaneum", featured in the film ''[[Gomorra (film)|Gomorra]],'' won an Italian award for Best Song. Later that month, Del Naja and Marshall picked up a special [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268565/massive-attack-to-return-with-huge-world-tour|title=Massive Attack to Return with Huge World Tour|work=Billboard|accessdate=25 May 2009}}</ref>

The fifth album was released on 12 November 2009, called ''[[Heligoland (album)|Heligoland]],'' after the German [[archipelago]] of [[Heligoland]], after a previous project called "Weather Underground" was abandoned.<ref name="auto"/> Del Naja said "I think it's got definitely a more organic feel".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Massive+Attack%3A+Heligoland+/|title=Interview w/ Massive Attack's Robert Del Naja re.

===''Eutopia'' EP and audiovisual releases===
In July 2020, Massive Attack released a political audiovisual EP called “[[Eutopia]]”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/massive-attack-tease-new-eutopia-ep-with-mysterious-instagram-posts-2704269|title=Massive Attack debut stunning audio-visual EP 'Eutopia'|website=Nme.com|date=10 July 2020|accessdate=25 November 2020}}</ref> The three track fusion was created across five cities during the Covid-19 global lockdown period, and was part-formed by generative algorithmic visuals from AI Art pioneer [[Mario Klingemann]] and collaborations with [[Algiers (band)|Algiers]], [[Young Fathers]] and US poet [[Saul Williams]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicpressure.org/massive-attacks-eutopia-addresses-our-need-for-a-radical-global-change/|title=Massive Attack's Eutopia addresses our need for a radical global change &#124; Public Pressure|website=Publicpressure.org|accessdate=25 November 2020}}</ref> The conceptual project, co-written and produced by 3D and documentary filmmaker [[Mark Donne]] featured strong arguments for global system change from UN Paris Climate Agreement author [[Christiana Figueres]], founder of the [[Universal Basic Income]] Principle Professor [[Guy Standing (economist)|Guy Standing]] and inventor of the US “Wealth Tax” policy Professor [[Gabriel Zucman]].

==Musical style==
Some of their most noted songs have been without choruses and have featured dramatically atmospheric dynamics, conveyed through either distorted guitar crescendos, lavish orchestral arrangements or prominent, looped/shifting basslines, underpinned by high and exacting production values, involving sometimes copious digital editing and mixing.<ref name=timedigital/> The pace of their music has often been slower than prevalent British [[Electronic dance music|dance music]] of the time. These and other [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]], soundtrack-like and DJist sonic techniques, formed a much-emulated style journalists began to dub "[[trip hop]]" from the mid-nineties onwards,<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d2644|pure_url=yes}}|title=Trip Hop|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=20 May 2009}}</ref> though in an interview in 2006, Daddy G said, "We used to hate that terminology [trip-hop] so bad,' laughs. 'You know, as far we were concerned, Massive Attack music was unique, so to put it in a box was to pigeonhole it and to say, "Right, we know where you guys are coming from.""<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hour.ca/music/music.aspx?iIDArticle=10216|title=Massive Attack in Montreal, September 11|work=Hour|publisher=Communications Voir Inc.|date=7 September 2006|accessdate=26 May 2009|last=Tousignant|first=Isa|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027212620/http://www.hour.ca/music/music.aspx?iIDArticle=10216|archive-date=27 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Other projects==
==='Fire Sale' exhibition===
A solo exhibition of Del Naja's art was held at the Lazarides gallery in central London, from 24 May to 22 June 2013. The show's content spanned a period of over twenty years and featured many of the art pieces that Del Naja created for Massive Attack. Each piece, reinterpreted especially for the exhibition, was hand-printed and finished. The show also featured three one-off 'digital infinity mirrors', two of which contained phrases supplied by [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] that were extracted from [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] pilot dialogues. Del Naja performed a DJ set during the opening night on 23 May 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lazinc.com/exhibitions/582,3d-fire-sale|title=Exhibition 3D: Fire Sale|publisher=Lazarides|accessdate=26 October 2013}}</ref>

===Massive Attack and Adam Curtis===
Del Naja conceived and designed an eight-night festival with filmmaker [[Adam Curtis]]—in collaboration with UVA ([[United Visual Artists]])—that premiered in Manchester, UK in July 2013. The festival featured Curtis's film, unofficially titled ''The Plan,'' which was projected on a huge screen surrounding the audience, while music from Massive Attack was interweaved throughout the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://louderthanwar.com/an-open-letter-to-massive-attack-and-adam-curtis/|title=An Open Letter To Massive Attack And Adam Curtis|publisher=Louder Than War|accessdate=26 October 2013}}</ref> Del Naja, who orchestrated the film's soundtrack, described the experience as a "collective hallucination" and the film was also shown at the [[Manchester International Festival]] in July 2013.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Tim|last1=Adams|accessdate=2019-02-17|title=Massive Attack v Adam Curtis – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/07/adam-curtis-massive-attack-review|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=6 July 2013|issn=0029-7712}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-02-17|title=Massive Attack v Adam Curtis, Manchester International Festival – review|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e7afe1bc-e55f-11e2-8d0b-00144feabdc0|website=Financial Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first1=Ian|last1=Youngs|accessdate=2019-02-17|title=Depot gig opens Manchester festival|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-23158914|date=5 July 2013|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2019-02-17|title=Music review: Massive Attack v Adam Curtis for the Manchester|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/music-review-massive-attack-v-adam-curtis-for-the-manchester-international-festival-was-sadly-a-8690664.html|date=5 July 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Music created by Del Naja for the festival became the score for a [[BBC]] production entitled ''[[HyperNormalisation]]'' in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04b183c|title=HyperNormalisation|date=16 October 2016|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=30 October 2018}}</ref>

They were used as visuals for cover versions of non Massive Attack songs based on samples and loops that made up the album's identity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/09/25/massive-attack-robert-del-naja-mezzanine-interview|title=A rare interview with Massive Attack’s Robert Del Naja on creating the most subversive live show of 2019|website=The FADER}}</ref>

===Mezzanine DNA===
In April 2019, it was reported that Massive Attack had encoded ''Mezzanine'' into DNA to mark the 20th anniversary of the seminal 1998 album. 
The album has also been made available in the form of a matt black spray paint can. A limited number of spray cans will contain the DNA encoded audio within matt black paint and each can will contain approximately one million copies of the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/massive-attack-encoding-album-into-dna/|title=Massive Attack Encoding Album Into DNA|website=Pitchfork.com}}</ref> Addressing the novel storage method, Del Naja – who is also known as a graffiti artist as ‘3D' – said: “It’s a creative way to store your back catalogue, although DNA-encoded spray paint is unlikely to be adopted by street artists seeking anonymity”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/10/massive-attack-dna-spray-paint-can/|title=Massive Attack releasing DNA-encoded Mezzanine in spray paint can|date=19 October 2018}}</ref>

Massive Attack have previously played two shows in [[Israel]], but have declined recent offers.

To help save the planet we’ll have to change &#124; Massive Attack|date=28 November 2019|website=Theguardian.com|access-date=26 August 2020}}</ref> "the commissioning of the renowned Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research to map the full carbon footprint of typical tour cycles, and to look specifically at the three key areas where CO2 emissions in our sector are generated." This will include information about band travel and production, audience transport and venue.
