==History==
In October 2000, [[Iowa State University]] students Josh Carlson, Mike Seager, and Mark Fiddleke launched Chegg's forerunner, Cheggpost, a [[Craigslist]]-style message board for Iowa State students.<ref>[http://www.iowastatedaily.com/news/auction-site-connects-buyers-and-sellers/article_e0bf5fb2-23c6-5631-a556-fe73fd8685c6.html "Auction site connects buyers and sellers" by Nate Engelberth; ''Iowa State Daily''; October 19, 2000.]</ref><ref name=":022">{{Cite book|title=International directory of company histories.|last=Pederson, Jay P., editor.|date=2013|publisher=St. James Press|isbn=9781414482224|location=|pages=115|oclc=833188977}}</ref> ''Chegg'' is a combination of the words ''chicken'' and ''egg'', and references the founders’ [[Catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]] feeling of being unable to obtain a job without experience, while being unable to acquire experience without a job.<ref name="tws26jan4b">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/business/05ping.html|title=We Rent Movies, So Why Not Textbooks?|author=Miguel Helft|date=July 4, 2009| accessdate=2010-01-26|newspaper=The New York Times|quote=... calculated that his bill for books that semester would have been $334 with Chegg, far less than the $657 he paid...}}</ref>

Carlson then teamed with Iowa State MBA [[Osman Rashid]], an avid user of the site who recognized its potential to disrupt the textbook market, which had "drastically outpaced the rate of [[inflation]]".<ref>[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/222655 "Fast-Growing Chegg Aims for High Marks with Students" by Lisa Girard; ''Entrepreneur''; January 18, 2012.]</ref> The company was incorporated in 2005 by Carlson, Rashid, and Aayush Phumbhra.<ref name=":022"/> At that time, it offered scholarship searches, internship matching, and college application advice.<ref name=":3"/> Some initial start-up funding was provided by Rashid.<ref name=MoneyInc>[https://moneyinc.com/chegg-turned-education-upside/ "How Chegg Has Turned Education Upside Down" by Nat Berman; ''Money Inc''; November 7, 2016.]</ref>

In February 2006, Carlson left the company.<ref name=MoneyInc/> Phumbhra and Rashid rebranded,  launching Chegg, Inc. in December 2007, with Rashid as CEO. After ending services unrelated to renting and purchasing textbooks,<ref name=":022"/> the company adjusted its business model to reflect that of [[Netflix]]'s then rental-based model, concentrating on renting textbooks to students,<ref name="tws26jan4b"/><ref name=tws26jan11a21ax1>{{cite news|author=Julie Schmit|title=Chegg CEO Rashid applies Netflix concept to textbooks|work=USA Today|date=2009-01-12|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/entre/2009-01-11-chegg-rashid_N.htm|accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref> and Chegg expanded to a national market.<ref name=Forbes/> It later added goods and student services through corporate acquisitions.<ref name=Forbes>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/helencoster/2012/01/25/chegg/ "Apple Creates New Wrinkle In Start-Up's Plan To Disrupt Textbook Industry" by Helen Coster; ''Forbes''; January 25, 2012]</ref>

Chegg served as the exclusive rental outlet.<ref name="thebookseller.com"/>

In September 2018, Chegg announced a data breach had occurred in April 2018 that may have involved 40 million active and inactive registered users. The breach may have included data such as user names, Chegg passwords, email addresses, and shipping addresses. The company reported that social security numbers and bank account information were not affected by the breach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495418000187/cyrus.htm|title=CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934|publisher=Security and Exchange Commission|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>

==Criticism and controversies==
Some services offered by Chegg have been repeatedly documented as being problematic.<ref name=":1" /> These services include academic file-sharing,<ref>Rogerson, A. M., & Basanta, G. (2016).

In February 2019, Chegg formed a partnership with [[Purdue University]]'s [[Online Writing Lab]] (OWL), to make online educational writing tools more accessible to its students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q1/the-purdue-university-online-writing-lab-and-chegg-partner-to-make-world-class-writing-education-tools-more-accessible.html|title=The Purdue University Online Writing Lab and Chegg Partner to Make World-Class Writing Education Tools More Accessible|last=Pratt|first=Kati|website=Purdue.edu|publisher=Purdue University|date=February 6, 2019|accessdate=November 19, 2019}}</ref> The affiliation was met by some faculty criticism, alluding to Chegg helping students cheat;<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/03/12/purdue-professors-criticize-writing-partnership-chegg|title=The Wrong Partnership?|last=Mckenzie|first=Lindsay|website=InsideHigherEd.com|date=March 12, 2019|accessdate=November 19, 2019}}</ref> OWL director Harry Denny reported that he did not expect Purdue's reputation to suffer as a result, citing that “My experience has been that the company is committed to partnering with faculty and administration to address their concerns."

Controversy around the company, and related companies offering similar services, escalated in 2020, amidst the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name=":2" /><ref name="Georgia Tech warns" /> For example, [[Georgia Tech]] alerted students in a physics class that certain students in the class had cheated on their online final exam by using answers posted on Chegg,<ref name="Georgia Tech warns">{{cite news|url=https://www.ajc.com/blog/get-schooled/georgia-tech-warns-physics-students-who-cheated-admit-risk-failing/3iQOCvBiwuqEXQivS63VqK/ |title=Georgia Tech warns physics students who cheated: Admit it or risk failing |first=Maureen |last=Downey |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date= May 4, 2020 |accessdate=August 5, 2020}}</ref> certain students in a chemistry class at [[Boston University]] were found to have similarly cheated on an online exam,<ref name="looking to limit">{{cite news|url=https://dailyfreepress.com/2020/04/28/chemistry-and-physics-department-looking-to-limit-cheating/ |title=Chemistry and physics departments looking to limit cheating |first=Allison |last=Pirog |work=[[The Daily Free Press]] |date=April 28, 2020 |accessdate=August 5, 2020}}</ref> and solutions to a physics exam at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] were posted on Chegg during the exam period.<ref name="integrity breach">{{cite news|url=https://www.studlife.com/news/2020/04/15/arts-sciences-investigates-physics-192-academic-integrity-breach/ |title=Arts & Sciences investigates Physics 192 academic integrity breach |first=Jayla |last=Butler |work=[[Student Life (newspaper)|Student Life]] |date=April 15, 2020 |accessdate=August 5, 2020}}</ref> Chegg is allegedly cooperating with the investigations.<ref name="Georgia Tech warns" /><ref name="looking to limit" /><ref name="integrity breach" /> As a result, some schools have now begun providing explicit guidance to students regarding file-sharing.<ref>Sheridan College.
