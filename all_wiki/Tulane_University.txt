'''Tulane University''' is a [[private university|private]] [[research university]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].  It was founded as a public medical college in 1834 and became a comprehensive university in 1847. The institution was made private under the endowments of [[Paul Tulane]] and [[Josephine Louise Newcomb]] in 1884. Tulane is the 9th oldest private university in the [[Association of American Universities]], which consists of major research universities in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The [[Tulane University Law School]] and [[Tulane University Medical School]] are, respectively, the 12th oldest law school and 15th oldest medical school in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsabout/index.aspx |title=About Tulane Law School |publisher=Law.tulane.edu |access-date=November 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806005444/http://www.law.tulane.edu/tlsabout/index.aspx |archive-date=August 6, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.umcno.org/partners |title=Our Partners: Teaching the next generation of healthcare providers |publisher=University Medical Center New Orleans |access-date=February 19, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220094145/http://www.umcno.org/partners |archive-date=February 20, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1847, the state legislature established the school as the '''University of Louisiana''',<ref name="facts"/> a [[State university system|public university]], and the [[Tulane University Law School|law department]] was added to the university. Subsequently, in 1851, the university established its first academic department. The first president chosen for the new university was [[Francis Lister Hawks]], an Episcopal priest and prominent citizen of New Orleans at the time.

The university was closed from 1861 to 1865 during the [[American Civil War]]. After reopening, it went through a period of financial challenges because of an extended agricultural depression in the South which affected the nation's economy. [[Paul Tulane]], owner of a prospering dry goods and clothing business, donated extensive real estate within New Orleans for the support of education. This donation led to the establishment of a Tulane Educational Fund (TEF), whose board of administrators sought to support the University of Louisiana instead of establishing a new university. In response, through the influence of former [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] general [[Randall Lee Gibson]], the Louisiana state legislature transferred control of the University of Louisiana to the administrators of the TEF in 1884.<ref name="facts"/> This act created the '''Tulane University of Louisiana'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/sub.asp?key=748&subkey=14527&start=782 |title=The Carnegie Foundation |access-date=June 21, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114111825/http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/sub.asp?key=748&subkey=14527&start=782 |archive-date=January 14, 2009 }}</ref> The university was privatized, and is one of only a few American universities to be converted from a state public institution to a private one.<ref name="The American Presidency Project">{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=4859|title=Gerald R.

In 1884, [[William Preston Johnston]] became the first president of Tulane. He had succeeded [[Robert E. Lee]] as president of [[Washington and Lee University]] after Lee's death. He had moved to Louisiana and become president of [[Louisiana State University]].

In 1885, the university established its graduate division, later becoming the Graduate School. One year later, gifts from [[Josephine Louise Newcomb]] totaling over $3.6 million, led to the establishment of the [[H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College]] within Tulane University. Newcomb was the first coordinate college for women in the United States and became a model for such institutions as [[Pembroke College in Brown University|Pembroke College]] and [[Barnard College]].<ref name="dates"/> In 1894 the College of Technology formed, which would later become the School of Engineering. In the same year, the university moved to its present-day uptown campus on historic [[St. Charles Avenue]], [[St. Charles Avenue Streetcar|five miles (8&nbsp;km) by streetcar]] from downtown New Orleans.<ref name="dates"/>

===20th century===

With the improvements to Tulane University in the late 19th century, Tulane had a firm foundation to build upon as the premier university of the [[Deep South]] and continued this legacy with growth in the 20th century. In 1901, the first cornerstone was laid for the F.W. Tilton Library, endowed by New Orleans businessman and [[philanthropist]] [[Frederick W. Tilton|Frederick William Tilton]] (1821–1890). During 1907, the school established a four-year professional curriculum in architecture through the College of Technology, growing eventually into the [[Tulane School of Architecture]]. One year later, Schools of Dentistry and Pharmacy were established, albeit temporarily. The School of Dentistry ended in 1928, and Pharmacy six years later.<ref name="dates"/> In 1914, Tulane established a College of Commerce, the first [[business school]] in [[Southern United States|the South]].<ref name="dates">{{cite web| url=http://www.tulane.edu/~alumni/potpourri/IF.pdf| title=Significant dates in Tulane's History| publisher=tulane.edu| access-date=June 7, 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615013419/http://www.tulane.edu/~alumni/potpourri/IF.pdf| archive-date=June 15, 2007| url-status=live}}</ref> In 1925, Tulane established the independent Graduate School.

The [http://mari.tulane.edu/ Middle American Research Institute] was established in 1925 at Tulane "for the purpose of advanced research into the history (both Indian and colonial), archaeology, tropical botany (both economic and medical), the natural resources and products, of the countries facing New Orleans across the waters to the south; to gather, index and disseminate data thereupon; and to aid in the upbuilding of the best commercial and friendly relations between these Trans-Caribbean peoples and the United States."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~mari/|title=mission statement of the Middle American Research Institute|year=1925|access-date=May 14, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506160943/http://www.tulane.edu/~mari/|archive-date=May 6, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Tulane School of Professional Advancement|University College]] was established in 1942 as Tulane's division of continuing education. By 1950, the School of Architecture had grown out of Engineering into an independent school. In 1958, the university was elected to the [[Association of American Universities]], an organization consisting of 62 of the leading research universities in North America. The [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine|School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine]] again became independent from the School of Medicine in 1967. It was established in 1912. Tulane's School of Tropical Medicine also remains the only one of its kind in the country. On April 23, 1975, President [[Gerald Ford]] spoke at Tulane University's Fogelman Arena at the invitation of Congressman [[F. Edward Hebert]], a representative of Louisiana's 1st Congressional District. During the historic speech, Ford announced that the Vietnam War was "finished as far as America is concerned" – one week before the fall of [[Saigon]]. Ford drew parallels to the [[Battle of New Orleans]], saying that such positive activity could do for America's morale what the battle did in 1815.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/speeches/750208.htm |title=Address at a Tulane University Convocation |year=1975 |publisher=Ford Presidential Library |access-date=January 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926033522/http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/speeches/750208.htm |archive-date=September 26, 2006 }}</ref>

===21st century===
In July 2004, Tulane received two $30-million donations to its [[financial endowment|endowment]], the largest individual or combined gifts in the university's history. The donations came from [[James H. Clark]], a member of the university's board of trustees and founder of [[Netscape]], and [[David Filo]], a graduate of its School of Engineering and co-founder of [[Yahoo!]]. A fund-raising campaign called "Promise & Distinction" raised $730.6 million by October 3, 2008, increasing the university's total endowment to more than $1.1 billion; by March 2009, Yvette Jones, Tulane's Chief Operating Officer, told Tulane's Staff Advisory Council that the endowment "has lost close to 37%", affected by the [[Great Recession]].<ref name="endow2009">{{cite web| url=http://tulane.edu/sac/upload/SAC-Minutes-3-12-2009.doc| format=[[DOC (computing)|DOC]]| title=Tulane University Staff Advisory Council: Minutes of Thursday, March 12, 2009| publisher=Tulane University| date=March 12, 2009| access-date=April 29, 2009| quote=Tulane made some hard decisions after Katrina, and we are not in as difficult position that many institutions are in now.

====Hurricane Katrina====

[[File:Tulane Freeman School of Business interior.jpg|thumb|Main hall at the Freeman School of Business]]
As a result of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in August 2005 and its damaging effects on New Orleans, most of the university was closed for the second time in its history—the first being during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The closing affected the first semester of the school calendar year. The School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine's distance learning programs and courses stayed active. The School of Medicine relocated to [[Houston]], [[Texas]] for a year. Aside from student athletes attending college classes together on the same campuses, most undergraduate and graduate students dispersed to campuses throughout the U.S. The storm inflicted more than $650 million in damages to the university, with some of the greatest losses impacting the [[Howard-Tilton Memorial Library]] and its collections.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tulane.edu/news/releases/pr_071510.cfm |title=Tulane University - Sources for News Coverage of Hurricane Katrina's Fifth Anniversary |access-date=April 9, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413133433/https://tulane.edu/news/releases/pr_071510.cfm |archive-date=April 13, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Facing a budget shortfall, the Board of Administrators announced a "Renewal Plan" in December 2005 to reduce its annual operating budget and create a "student-centric" campus. Addressing the school's commitment to New Orleans, a course credit involving [[Service-learning|service learning]] became a requirement for an undergraduate degree. In 2006 Tulane became the first Carnegie ranked "high research activity" institution to have an undergraduate public service graduation requirement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tulane.edu/cps/about/graduation-requirement.cfm |title=Public Service Graduation Requirement |publisher=Tulane.edu |date=July 8, 2010 |access-date=April 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402001616/http://tulane.edu/cps/about/graduation-requirement.cfm |archive-date=April 2, 2012 }}</ref> In May 2006, graduation ceremonies included commencement speakers former Presidents [[George H.

Tulane's primary campus is located in [[Uptown New Orleans]] on [[St. Charles Avenue]], directly opposite [[Audubon Park (New Orleans)|Audubon Park]], and extends north to South Claiborne Avenue through [[Freret, New Orleans|Freret]] and Willow Street. The campus is known colloquially as the Uptown or St. Charles campus. It was established in the 1890s and occupies more than {{convert|110|acre|km2}} of land. The campus is known both for its large [[live oak]] trees as well as its architecturally historic buildings. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1978. The campus architecture consists of several styles, including [[Richardsonian Romanesque]], Elizabethan, [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]], Mid-Century Modern, and contemporary styles. The front campus buildings use Indiana White Limestone or orange brick for exteriors, while the middle campus buildings are mostly adorned in red St. Joe brick, the staple of Newcomb College Campus buildings. [[Loyola University New Orleans|Loyola University]] is directly adjacent to Tulane, on the downriver side. [[Audubon Place (New Orleans, Louisiana)|Audubon Place]], where the [[President of Tulane]] resides, is on the upriver side. The President's residence is the former home of "banana king" [[Sam Zemurray]], who donated it in his will.

The centerpiece of the Gibson Quad is the first academic building built on campus, [[Gibson Hall (Tulane University)|Gibson Hall]], in 1894. The Schools of Architecture is also located on the oldest section of the campus, occupying all of Richardson Hall. The middle of the campus, between Freret and Willow Streets and bisected by [[McAlister Place, New Orleans|McAlister Place]] and Newcomb Place, serves as the center of campus activities. The Lavin-Bernick Center for University Life, [[Devlin Fieldhouse]], McAlister Auditorium, Howard-Tilton Memorial Library, and most of the student residence halls and academic buildings populate the center of campus.

The [[Howard-Tilton Memorial Library]] was under construction from 2013 to 2016.

===Environmental sustainability===
Tulane hosted an Environmental Summit at its law school in April 2009, an event that all students could attend for free. Many students from Tulane's two active environmental groups, Green Club and Environmental Law Society, attended. These student groups push for global citizenship and environmental stewardship on campus. In 2007 Tulane made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10%, getting students involved by providing an Energy Smart Shopping Guide and electronics "greening" services from IT.

===Core curriculum===
As part of the post-Hurricane Katrina Renewal Plan, the university initiated an extensive university-wide core curriculum. Three major elements of the university core are (1) freshman seminars called TIDES classes, (2) a two-class sequence for public service, and (3) a capstone experience for students to apply knowledge in their fields of study. Many course requirements of the core curriculum can be certified through [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) exams or [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) course credits, or placement exams in English and foreign languages offered by the university during orientation. Some schools have different core requirements (e.g., students in the School of Science and Engineering are required to take fewer language classes than students in the School of Liberal Arts).

===Admissions===
The Office of Undergraduate Admission received 43,891 applications for fall 2020 — over a 69 percent increase over the last six years. The Early Decision (ED) applicant pool also increased over 60 percent since 2017. Due to the sharp increase of applications, the acceptance rate fell to 11 percent, making this the most selective class yet.  Among freshman students who enrolled in Fall 2020, composite SAT scores for the middle 50% ranged from 1410 to 1510, while composite ACT scores for the middle 50% ranged from 31 to 33. In terms of class rank, 64% of enrolled freshmen were in the top 10% of their high school classes; 89% ranked in the top quarter. From a nationwide perspective, ''U.S. News & World Report'' categorizes Tulane as "''most selective''," which is the highest degree of selectivity the magazine offers and Tulane is the only institution in Louisiana to have that distinction.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/tulane-university-2029|title=Tulane University|magazine=U.S. News & World Report|access-date=February 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208063637/http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/tulane-university-2029|archive-date=February 8, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Honors program admissions====
The most impressive incoming undergraduate students are invited to join the honors program by the Office of Admission.  Incoming freshmen who did not receive an invitation are allowed to apply for one after completing their first semester with at least a 3.8 cumulative GPA.  To remain in good standing with the honors program, honors students are required to maintain at least a 3.8 cumulative GPA and enroll in honors classes their first year in the program. Honors students have access to special privileges and learning opportunities on campus.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://honors.tulane.edu/content/requirements/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191019141227/https://honors.tulane.edu/content/requirements/ |archive-date=October 19, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Scholarships===
The Dean's Honor Scholarship is a merit-based [[scholarship]] awarded by Tulane which covers full tuition for the duration of the recipient's undergraduate program. The scholarship is offered to between 75 and 100 incoming freshmen by the Office of Undergraduate Admission, and is awarded only through a separate application. This scholarship is renewable provided that the recipient maintains a minimum 3.0 [[GPA]] at the end of each semester and maintains continuous enrollment in a full-time undergraduate division. Typically, recipients have SAT I score of 1450 or higher or an ACT composite score of 33 or higher, rank in the top 5% of their [[High school (North America)|high school]] graduating class, have a rigorous course load including honors and [[Advanced Placement]] classes, and an outstanding record of extracurricular activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tulane.edu/%7Efinaid/dean%27s_honor_scholarship.shtml |title=Dean's Honor Scholarship information |publisher=Tulane.edu |access-date=April 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218093742/http://www.tulane.edu/~finaid/dean's_honor_scholarship.shtml |archive-date=February 18, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Notable recipients include [[Sean M. Berkowitz]] and [[David Filo]].

Beginning in 2014, Tulane has partnered with the [[Stamps Family Charitable Foundation]] to offer the full-ride merit-based Stamps Leadership Scholarship, Tulane's most prestigious scholarship.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://admission.tulane.edu/tuition-aid/merit-scholarships |title=Merit Scholarships |publisher=Tulane.edu |access-date=April 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314040823/http://www.admission.tulane.edu/tuition-aid/merit-scholarships |archive-date=March 14, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Approximately 5 incoming students are awarded the Stamps Scholarship each year, and Tulane graduated its first class of Stamps Scholars in May 2018.

==Student life==
The student body of Tulane University is represented by the Associated Student Body (ASB). In 1998, the students of Tulane University voted by referendum to split the Associated Student Body (ASB) Senate into two separate houses, the Undergraduate Student Government (USG) and the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GAPSA). USG and GAPSA come together twice a semester to meet as the ASB Senate, where issues pertaining to the entire Tulane student body are discussed. The meetings of the ASB Senate are presided over by the ASB President, the only student that represents all students of Tulane University.

Tulane maintains 3,600 beds in 14 residence halls on its uptown campus for undergraduate students. Per the Renewal Plan instituted after Hurricane Katrina, Tulane requires all freshmen and sophomores to live on campus, except those who are from surrounding neighborhoods in New Orleans. Due to the increasing size of incoming classes, Tulane has allowed a small number of rising sophomores to reside off campus instead of being required to remain in campus housing. Housing is not guaranteed for juniors and seniors.

===Student media===
[[Tulane Hullabaloo|''The Tulane Hullabaloo'']] is the university's weekly student-run newspaper. It is published every Thursday of the academic year, except on holidays, and has received multiple [[National Pacemaker Awards|Pacemaker Awards]], the highest award in college journalism.

The Tulane Vignette is the university's unofficial weekly satirical online newspaper. It has received multiple awards.

The ''Jambalaya'', Tulane's [[yearbook]], published annually since 1897, published its last edition (Volume 99) in 1995, because of funding and management problems. In the fall of 2003, the ''Jambalaya'' was reestablished as a student club, and in the Spring of 2004, the centennial edition of the ''Jambalaya'' was published. The staff now continues to publish a ''Jambalaya'' annually.

''The Rival'' is a student-run, online-only publication of opinion, commentary, and satire. It features three sections: campus, culture, and current.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://tulane.therival.news/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 31, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190201134442/http://tulane.therival.news/ |archive-date=February 1, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The student-run [[radio station]] of the university, [[WTUL]] New Orleans 91.5, began broadcasting on campus in 1971.

''The Crescent'' is a student run lifestyle magazine.

Tube, an acronym meaning Tulane University Broadcast Entertainment, is the university's student-run television station.

The Tulane Literary Society produces an arts, poetry, and prose magazine once a semester called the ''Tulane Review''.

Every fall, usually during [[homecoming]] week, Tulane holds a special ceremony for the presentation of the Tulane Ring, the [[class ring]] of the school, which is conferred upon students having earned 60 credits or more.

Tulane competes in [[NCAA Division I]] as a member of the [[American Athletic Conference]] (The American). The university was a charter member of the [[Southeastern Conference]], in which it competed until 1966. Just before leaving the SEC, it had notably become the first conference school to field a [[African Americans|black]] athlete when Stephen Martin, who was on an academic scholarship, played on the baseball team in the 1966 season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nola.com/tulane/index.ssf/2013/05/tulane_community_mourns_passin.html |title=Tulane community mourns death of SEC pioneer Stephen Martin |first=Tammy |last=Nunez |newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]] |date=May 15, 2013 |access-date=July 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016223503/http://www.nola.com/tulane/index.ssf/2013/05/tulane_community_mourns_passin.html |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Tulane, along with other academically-oriented, private schools had considered forming the "Southern Ivy League" ([[Magnolia League|Magnolia Conference]]) in the 1950s. Tulane's intercollegiate sports include [[college football|football]], [[college baseball|baseball]], men's and women's [[College basketball#Division I|basketball]], women's volleyball, men's and women's [[track and field|track]], men's and women's [[tennis]], and [[cross country running|cross country]], women's [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[Diving (sport)|diving]], women's [[tennis]], women's [[golf]], women's [[bowling]], and women's [[beach volleyball]]. Tulane's graduation rate for its student-athletes consistently ranks among the top of Division I athletics programs.

Tulane Green Wave teams have seen moderate success over the years. The school's national championships have all come from men's [[tennis]], with one [[NCAA Men's Tennis Championship#Team champions|team title]] in 1959 and multiple [[NCAA Men's Tennis Championship#Singles|singles]] and [[NCAA Men's Tennis Championship#Doubles|doubles]] titles. The [[Tulane Green Wave baseball|baseball team]] has won multiple conference titles, and in both [[2001 College World Series|2001]] and [[2005 College World Series|2005]], it finished with 56 wins and placed 5th at the [[College World Series]].

Most administrative and athletic support facilities are located in the Wilson Athletic Center in the center of Tulane's athletic campus. The adjacent area was once home to [[Tulane Stadium]], which seated more than 80,000 people, held three [[Super Bowl]]s, was home to the [[New Orleans Saints]], and gave rise to the [[Sugar Bowl]]. Home football games moved to the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] when it opened in 1975, and Tulane Stadium was demolished in 1980. The university has committed to upgrading its athletic facilities in recent years, extensively renovating [[Greer Field at Turchin Stadium|Turchin Stadium]] (baseball) in 2008, [[Devlin Fieldhouse|Fogelman Arena]] (now Devlin Fieldhouse; basketball and volleyball) in 2006 and 2012,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/blog/eye-on-college-basketball/20151213/trippin-tulane-rebuilds-its-program-from-players-to-facilities| title=Trippin': Tulane rebuilds its program from players to facilities| first=Matt| last=Norlander| work=CBS Sports| date=September 11, 2012| access-date=September 13, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521073330/http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/blog/eye-on-college-basketball/20151213/trippin-tulane-rebuilds-its-program-from-players-to-facilities| archive-date=May 21, 2013| url-status=live}}</ref> and Goldring Tennis Center in 2008.
