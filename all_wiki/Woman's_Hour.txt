'''''Woman's Hour''''' is a radio magazine programme broadcast in the [[United Kingdom]] on the [[BBC Light Programme]], [[BBC Radio 2]], and later [[BBC Radio 4]]. It has been on the air since 1946.

==History==
Created by [[Norman Collins]]<ref name=hist>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0165mfd |title=October 1946 - Woman's Hour - The first dedicated radio programme for women |date=11 March 2013 |website=History of the BBC |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=15 February 2020 |quote=Norman Collins, the creator of Woman's Hour, spoke about the programme in 1967.}}</ref> and originally presented by [[Alan Ivimey]], ''Woman's Hour'' was first broadcast on 7 October 1946 on the [[BBC]]'s [[The Light Programme|Light Programme]]. [[Janet Quigley]], who was also involved with the birth of the UK radio programme ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'', has been credited with "virtually creating" the programme.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |last=Cox |first=David |title=Obituary: Kevin FitzGerald |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-kevin-fitzgerald-1504964.html |date=18 November 1993 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |publisher=Newspaper Publishing |location=London |issn=09519467 |access-date=15 February 2020 |quote=Another more personal link with the BBC was his marriage to Janet Quigley, who virtually created the radio programme Woman's Hour which is still running today.}}</ref> 

The programme was transferred to its current home in 1973. Over the years it has been presented by Mary Hill (1946{{ndash}}1963), [[Joan Griffiths]] (1947{{ndash}}1949), [[Olive Shapley]] (1949{{ndash}}1953), [[Jean Metcalfe]] (1950{{ndash}}1968), [[Violet Carson]] (1952{{ndash}}1956), [[Marjorie Anderson]] (1958{{ndash}}1972), [[Teresa McGonagle]] (1958{{ndash}}1976), [[Judith Chalmers]] (1966{{ndash}}1970), [[Sue MacGregor]] (1972{{ndash}}1987), [[Jenni Murray]] (1987–2020), [[Martha Kearney]] (1998 to March 2007), and [[Jane Garvey (broadcaster)|Jane Garvey]] (since 8 October 2007). Fill-in presenters have included [[Sheila McClennon]], [[Carolyn Quinn]], [[Jane Little]], [[Ritula Shah]], [[Oona King]], [[Amanda Platell]] and [[Emma Barnett]]. In September 2020 it was announced that Barnett would be the chief presenter on BBC Radio 4's ''Woman's Hour''; due to the planned retirement of Jane Garvey and Jenni Murray. (Another presenter will appear on Fridays and Saturdays.} Barnett has already been one of several fill-in (occasional)  presenters; she was the youngest woman who has presented the programme. The last programme presented by Murray was on 1 October 2020.<ref>''Radio Times''; 26 Sept - 2 Oct 2020, pp. 124-25</ref> Emma Barnett will become the presenter in January 2021.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-54058275 Emma Barnett tells 5 Live listeners about departure; BBC News]</ref>

On 31 December 2004, the show became ''Man's Hour'' for one day only, on which it was presented by [[Channel 4 News]] anchor [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/b3cda5378e7c4b6c9f36003aacfe2ad4|title=Man's Hour - BBC Radio 4 FM - 31 December 2004 - BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-05-30}}</ref> On 18 July 2010, after 64 years of ''Woman's Hour'', the BBC began broadcasting a full series called ''[[Men's Hour]]'' on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], presented by [[Tim Samuels]].

For one week in April 2014, the programme was guest edited by [[J. K. Rowling]], [[Kelly Holmes]], [[Naomi Alderman]], [[Doreen Lawrence]] and [[Lauren Laverne]]. It was the first time the programme had a guest editor since its initial decade of broadcast.<ref name=guardian-20140410>{{cite news |last= Flood |first=Alison |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/10/jk-rowling-guest-editor-womans-hour |title=JK Rowling to become Woman's Hour first guest editor for 60 years |date=10 April 2014 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |location=London |eissn=17563224 |access-date=7 May 2014}}</ref> In September 2015, the programme hosted "Woman's Hour Takeover" with a week of guest editors, including [[Kim Cattrall]], [[Nimko Ali]], [[Rachel Treweek]], [[Michelle Mone, Baroness Mone|Michelle Mone]] and [[Jacqueline Wilson]].<ref name=bbc-20150930>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p031y7r9 |title=BBC Radio 4 - Woman's Hour Takeover |access-date=30 September 2015}}</ref>

''[[Late Night Woman's Hour]]'', a spinoff series, was launched in 2015, presented by [[Lauren Laverne]]. The series is broadcast in an 11{{nbsp}}pm timeslot and each episode takes a single topic for discussion.<ref>{{cite web |last=Glenni |first=Alasdair |date=21 August 2015 |title=Lauren Laverne raises eyebrows with Radio 4's Late Night Woman's Hour |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/21/lauren-laverne-radio-4-late-night-womans-hour-bbc |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |location=London |eissn=17563224 |access-date=3 July 2016}}</ref>
The lateness of the broadcast allows for more freedom to handle topics considered unsuitable for the morning broadcast.

The programme has an annual "power list" of highly achieving women.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3J92brPmK0hskzhpTV3CrZ0/the-power-list-2013 The Power List 2013]; British Broadcasting Corporation</ref> The annual power list is determined by a panel of judges.<ref>{{cite web|title=Woman's Hour Power List 2014&nbsp;– the panel|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qlvb/features/power-list-panel-2014|publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]]}}</ref>

In October 2016, it was recorded that the programme has 3.7 million listeners weekly and is the second most popular daily podcast across BBC Radio. A quarter of its audience were reported to be under 35 and 40% male.<ref>{{cite news |last= Topping |first=Alexandra |date=10 October 2016 |title= Woman's Hour reaches 70th birthday – and no need for 'light dusting of powder' |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/10/womans-hour-celebrates-70th-anniversary |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |location=London |eissn=17563224 |access-date= 24 May 2019}}</ref> In 2013, the programme had 3.9 million listeners, 14% of whom were men.<ref name=guardian-20130811>{{cite news |last=Sawyer |first=Miranda |author-link=Miranda Sawyer |title=The Woman's Hour mix - does it work? |date=11 August 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/11/womans-hour-jenni-murray-radio |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |location=London |eissn=17563224 |access-date=7 May 2014}}</ref> In 2006 it had 2.7 million listeners, 4% of whom were men.<ref name=independent-20060203>{{cite news |last=Byrne |first=Ciar |title='Woman's Hour' discovers a new audience: men |date=3 February 2006 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/womans-hour-discovers-a-new-audience-men-6109975.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |publisher=[[Independent News & Media]] |location=London |issn=09519467 |access-date=7 May 2014}}</ref>

==Format==
In its current format, the first 45 minutes of the programme consist of reports, interviews and debates on health, education, cultural and political topics aimed at women and mothers. The last 15 minutes feature short-run drama [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]]s (''[[Woman's Hour Drama]]''), which periodically change.  One of the most popular of these is the recurring ''[[Ladies of Letters]]'' serials, starring [[Prunella Scales]] and [[Patricia Routledge]]. (This section is also broadcast at 7:45{{nbsp}}pm.) Before 1998 the last quarter of an hour was dedicated to readings.

==Schedule==
''Woman's Hour'' has been broadcast at 10{{nbsp}}am Monday to Friday since [[James Boyle (broadcasting)|James Boyle]]'s revision of the Radio 4 schedules in April 1998.  Between September 1991 and April 1998 it was broadcast at 10:30{{nbsp}}am, having previously gone out for many years in an early afternoon slot (2{{nbsp}}pm).  The programme's move to a morning slot was unpopular among some listeners who, for family or other reasons, work only in the morning. [[Michael Green (radio)|Michael Green]], the then controller of Radio 4, made his decision the previous year and considered the elimination of the programme title.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hendy |first=David |title=Life on Air: A History of Radio Four |year=2007 |page=332 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-924881-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gWAVDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA332 |via=[[Google Books]] |quote=Indeed, perhaps the name itself could change. The existing title undoubtedly made sense in 1946, when the programme was unashamedly designed to appeal to housewives, and entice women war-workers back into the home. But with more women going out to work and more men listening, with a new timeslot and a refreshed style, with all the progress that had been made in sex equality, how sensible would it be to keep calling it ''Woman's Hour'' in the decade to come?}}</ref> ''Weekend Woman's Hour'' is broadcast on Saturday afternoons at 4{{nbsp}}pm, features highlights of the previous week introduced by one of the presenters and lasts almost an hour. Additionally, episodes are made available as a podcast following the broadcast of each programme.

==Music==
In its earlier years, it used a variety of popular light classics as signature tunes, including such pieces as H. Elliott-Smith's ''Wanderlust (Waltz)'', [[Anthony Vincent Collins|Anthony Collins]]' ''Vanity Fair'', and the lively Overture from [[Gabriel Fauré]]'s ''[[Masques et Bergamasques (Fauré)|Masques et Bergamasques]].''  From the early 1970s, specially composed pieces were used, several of which were provided by the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]].

There is also a band called [[Woman's Hour (band)|Woman's Hour]], based in the UK and signed to the record label [[Secretly Canadian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secretlycanadian.com/artist/?name=womanshour|title=Woman's Hour – Biography|publisher=Secretly Canadian}}</ref>  records who took their name from the radio show.

==Controversies==
===Breach of BBC impartiality rules===
A listener complained about the 1 October 2018 edition of ''Woman's Hour'', which featured an item discussing the nomination of Judge [[Brett Kavanaugh]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0000m7h |title=BBC Radio 4 - Woman's Hour, Melissa Laveaux, Kavanaugh Hearing, Care leavers at University |website=[[BBC Radio 4]]|date=1 October 2018}}</ref>  The feature included an interview with a law professor who had worked with [[Anita Hill]], in her pursuit of a sexual harassment complaint against an earlier nominee, Judge [[Clarence Thomas]]. The listener believed that allusions to the earlier case were immaterial and prejudicial, that the selection of interviewee was biased, and that presenter Jane Garvey had expressed her personal view on a controversial topic.

The BBC Executive Complaints Unit partially upheld the listener's complaint, stating that Garvey gave the impression of sympathising with the interviewee's viewpoint, and "did not challenge the interviewee in a manner which would have ensured due impartiality". As a result, the ''Woman’s Hour'' team and production staff attended a briefing on impartiality.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/ecu/womans-hour-radio-4-1-october-2018 |title=Woman's Hour, Radio 4, 1 October 2018 |date=19 June 2019 |website=Complaints |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=15 February 2020 |quote=The item made clear the differences, as well as the points of comparison, between the Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh cases, and the inclusion of an interviewee who clearly represented one viewpoint in the current case did not of itself lead to bias.  However, the presenter gave the impression of sympathising with that viewpoint, and did not challenge the interviewee in a manner which would have ensured due impartiality.}}</ref>

==Feminism==
''Woman's Hour'' presenter Jenni Murray is a former [[Patronage#Charity|patron]] of the charity [[Women's Aid]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.womensaid.org.uk/page.asp?section=0001000100150003 |title=Patrons & Ambassadors |publisher=[[Women's Aid]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717051825/http://www.womensaid.org.uk/page.asp?section=0001000100150003 |archive-date=17 July 2011 |access-date=16 February 2020 |quote=Our inaugural Patron, Jenni Murray, a Broadcaster on Woman's Hour on Radio 4, has supported Women's Aid for many years. Jenni joined us as a Patron of Women's Aid in 2002.}}</ref> and is president of the [[Fawcett Society]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/our-president/ |title=Our President |publisher=[[Fawcett Society]] |access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref>

In April 2014, Radio 4's [[Roger Bolton (producer)|Roger Bolton]] noted on the BBC's [[Feedback (radio series)|Feedback]] Blog: "As you well know BBC programmes are supposed to be impartial but I'm not sure if that can be said of ''Woman’s Hour'', at least when it comes to feminism. ''Woman's Hour'' is in fact a powerful advocate for women’s empowerment and this week as part of that campaign it produced its second power list."<ref>{{cite web |last=Bolton |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Bolton (producer) |title=Feedback: What is the Point of Power Lists |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/posts/Feedback-Womans-Hour |date=11 April 2014 |website=Radio 4 blog |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=20 September 2014}}</ref>
