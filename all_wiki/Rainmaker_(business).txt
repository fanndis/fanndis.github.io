The origin of the business sense of ''rainmaker'' may be an allusion to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] practice of dancing to encourage deities to bring forth the rain necessary for crops. In summertime during a drought, for instance, the rainmaker would dance and sing songs on the plains, and the activity was believed by others in the tribe to magically cause clouds to come and bring the life-giving rain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rain Dance|url=http://www.indians.org/articles/rain-dance.html|work=Indians.org|publisher=American Indian Heritage Foundation|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref>  By analogy, a business rainmaker would magically bring new business and clients to a firm or generate more revenue from existing customers and donors, and ''rain'' is a [[metaphor]] for money.<ref>Jeffrey J. Fox. How to Become a Rainmaker. Hyperion (May 17, 2000) {{ISBN|0-7868-6595-4}}</ref> An example was the late advertising agency executive [[Frederick D. Sulcer]] who was described as a ''rainmaker'' after bringing numerous new accounts to every agency he's with. According to one view, the role of the rainmaker is to find a dormant business problem and then create a vision of what life could be like if that problem were solved.

The term ''rainmaking'' is also applied to political fund-raising;<ref name=twsJunB514>{{cite news
