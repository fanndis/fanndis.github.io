==Career==

===1986–1991: Early years===
After graduating from the University of Missouri, Crow worked as a music teacher at Kellison Elementary School in [[Fenton, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Brown |first= John W. |title= Famous Faces of Missouri |date= April 21, 2006 |publisher= Emmis Books |isbn= 1-57860-251-3 }}</ref> Teaching during the day gave her the opportunity to sing in bands on the weekends. She was later introduced to local musician and record producer [[Jay Oliver]]. He had a studio in the basement of his parents' home in [[St. Louis]] and helped her by using her in advertising [[jingle]]s. Her first jingle was a back-to-school spot for the St. Louis department store [[Famous-Barr]]. Soon after she sang in commercial jingles for [[McDonald's]] and [[Toyota]]. She was quoted in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment as saying she made $40,000 on the McDonald's ad alone.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sheryl-crow-sounds-off-09-01-2003/ |title=Sheryl Crow Sounds Off |accessdate=June 9, 2014 |publisher=CBS News |date=January 9, 2003}}</ref>

Crow toured with [[Michael Jackson]] as a backing vocalist during his [[Bad (tour)|Bad]] tour 1987–1989, and often performed with Jackson on "[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]".<ref name="allmusicbio">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p26313/biography|pure_url=yes}} AllMusic.com Sheryl Crow Biography]. Retrieved February 20, 2008.</ref> She also recorded background vocals for [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Belinda Carlisle]], [[Jimmy Buffett]], and [[Don Henley]].

In 1989, Crow contributed backing vocals to the [[Neal Schon]] track "Smoke of the Revolution" from his album ''[[Late Nite]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/late-nite-mw0000653472/credits|title=Late Nite – Neal Schon – Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=August 30, 2019}}</ref>

Crow also sang in the short-lived [[Steven Bochco]] drama ''[[Cop Rock]]'' series finale in 1990 and her song "Heal Somebody" appeared in the film ''[[Bright Angel]]''. In 1991, her recording of "Welcome to the Real Life" featured on the soundtrack to the [[Brian Bosworth]] action film, ''[[Stone Cold (1991 film)|Stone Cold]]''. Later that year, her performance of "Hundreds of Tears" was included on the ''[[Point Break (1991 film)|Point Break]]'' soundtrack and she sang a duet with [[Kenny Loggins]] on the track "I Would Do Anything", from his album ''[[Leap of Faith (Kenny Loggins album)|Leap of Faith]]''.

===1992: Scrapped debut album===
In 1992, Crow recorded her first attempt at a debut album with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]'s record producer [[Hugh Padgham]]. The self-titled debut album was due to be released in September 1992, but Crow and her label mutually decided that the album did not merit release. Crow described it as "too produced" and "slick". However, a handful of cassette copies of the album were leaked, along with press folders for album publicity. This album has been widely dispersed via [[file sharing]] networks and fan trading. In the meantime, Crow's songs were recorded by major artists such as [[Celine Dion]], [[Tina Turner]] and [[Wynonna Judd]].

===1993–1997: International success===
Crow began dating [[Kevin Gilbert (musician)|Kevin Gilbert]] and joined him in an ad hoc group of musicians known to themselves as the "Tuesday Music Club".<!-- Note: unlike the album title, the club name did not include the word "Night" --><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/08.01.96/gilbert-obit-9631.html |title= All Rocked Out |accessdate=December 16, 2007 |first= Richard |last= Sine |date= August 1, 1996 |work= [[Metro Silicon Valley]]}}</ref> The group existed as a casual songwriting collective prior to its association with Crow, but rapidly developed into a vehicle for her debut album after her arrival. Group members Gilbert, [[David Baerwald]], and [[David Ricketts]] (both formerly of [[David & David]]), [[Bill Bottrell]], [[Brian MacLeod (US musician)|Brian MacLeod]], and Dan Schwartz share songwriting credits with Crow on her debut album, ''[[Tuesday Night Music Club]]'',<ref name="allmusicbio"/> released in August 1993. Her relationship with Gilbert became acrimonious soon after the album was released, and disputes arose about songwriting credits.<ref name="allmusicbio"/> ''Tuesday Night Music Club'' featured many of the songs written by Crow's friends, including the second single, "[[Leaving Las Vegas (song)|Leaving Las Vegas]]". The album was slow to garner attention, until "[[All I Wanna Do (Sheryl Crow song)|All I Wanna Do]]" became an unexpected smash hit in October 1994. As she later stated in ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', she found an old poetry book in a used book store in the Los Angeles area and used a poem as the lyrics of the song.<ref>{{cite web |title= Wyn Cooper: A Serendipitous Career |publisher= Academy of American Poets |date= n.d. |url= http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5822 |accessdate= August 23, 2009 |quote= Cooper, who had been quietly stringing together teaching gigs and establishing his reputation as a poet, was soon receiving royalty checks big enough to allow him to stop working. |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090903002029/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5822 |archivedate= September 3, 2009 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> The singles "[[Strong Enough (Sheryl Crow song)|Strong Enough]]" and "Can't Cry Anymore" were also released, with the first song ("Strong Enough") charting at No. 5 on ''Billboard'' and "Can't Cry Anymore" hitting the Top 40.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210031320/http://www.billboard.com/charts/1995-02-11/hot-100|url-status=dead|title=Top 100 Songs &#124; Billboard Hot 100 Chart|archivedate=December 10, 2013|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=August 30, 2019}}</ref> ''Tuesday Night Music Club'' went on to sell more than 7 million copies in the US and UK during the 1990s.

Crow performed at the 1994 [[Woodstock Festival]], and appeared in the "New Faces" section of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in 1994. She also supplied background vocals to the song "[[The Garden of Allah (song)|The Garden of Allah]]" from [[Don Henley]]'s 1995 album ''[[Actual Miles: Henley's Greatest Hits]]''.

During this period, she discussed in interviews having gone through a deep depression, and there was speculation about a brief affair with [[Eric Clapton]]. The debut single from this album, "[[My Favorite Mistake]]", was rumored to be about Clapton, but Crow says otherwise—that the song is about a philandering ex-boyfriend.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_09.24.98/music/live24.html |title=review of ''The Globe Sessions'' recovered November 2, 2005 |publisher=Eye.net |accessdate=October 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050416101149/http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_09.24.98/music/live24.html |archivedate=April 16, 2005}}</ref><ref>''Entertainment Weekly'', September 25, 1998, p. 42, recovered on November 2, 2005.</ref> Crow has refused to say who the song was about, telling ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine on the release of her album, "Oh, there will be just so much speculation, and because of that there's great safety and protection in the fact that people will be guessing so many different people and I'm the only person who will ever really know.

She has said that she did not enjoy the political promotion system utilized by country radio, saying: "You do lots of free [shows] for radio stations in trade for getting played between three and four in the morning. And that's just not how other formats work, and that goes against my grain. I'm too old to allow that for myself, and to spend any night away from my kid for that is not justified."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idolator.com/7654811/sheryl-crow-90s-pop-roots-new-album-be-myself |title=Sheryl Crow Will Return To Her '90s Pop Roots on New LP 'Be Myself' |work=Idolator |date=January 6, 2017 |accessdate=January 9, 2017 |author=Wass, Mike}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7647471/sheryl-crow-new-album-be-myself-pop-roots-interview |title=Sheryl Crow Seeking Unity, Going Back To Her Roots on Ninth Album |work=Billboard |date=January 5, 2017 |accessdate=January 9, 2017 |author=Kaufman, Gil}}</ref> An extensive tour is planned in support of the album, as is a six-day "Outlaws" tour in July 2017 headlined by [[Willie Nelson]] and including artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jason Isbell]], [[Margo Price]] and [[Hayes Carll]] among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/04/the-lineup-for-the-outlaw-music-festival-tour-has.html |title=Willie Nelson Bringing a Bunch of Friends on Unbelievably Stacked Outlaw Music Festival Tour |website=Pastemagazine.com |accessdate=May 26, 2017}}</ref> In June 2018, Crow supported [[James Taylor]] on part of his American tour after original support [[Bonnie Raitt]] was forced to miss several shows due to health reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/james-taylor-bonnie-raitt-plot-2018-u-s-tour-120701/|title=Bonnie Raitt Drops Out of James Taylor Tour Dates Due to Health Issue|first=Ryan|last=Reed|date=April 30, 2018}}</ref> She then embarked on a "Greatest Hits" tour in the UK, concluding with a set at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 2018|Isle of Wight Festival]] on June 24.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.heywhatsonnotts.co.uk/single-post/2018/04/10/MUSIC-NEWS-Sheryl-Crow-announces-headline-UK-tour-stopping-off-at-Nottinghams-Royal-Concert-Hall |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 29, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612210725/https://www.heywhatsonnotts.co.uk/single-post/2018/04/10/MUSIC-NEWS-Sheryl-Crow-announces-headline-UK-tour-stopping-off-at-Nottinghams-Royal-Concert-Hall |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Instruments and Signature Model guitars==
Early in her career, Crow performed extensively with a 1962 [[Gibson Country Western]] guitar which was her personal favorite, but she eventually feared that it would not stand up to the rigors of continued touring and stage use, and in 1999 asked [[Gibson]] to build her a replica for use on stage. The manufacturer responded by introducing a "Sheryl Crow" model in their Signature Artist Series, which is essentially a re-creation of the square-shouldered 1962-era Country Western model.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gibson.com/Guitars/Acoustic|title=Gibson Acoustic Guitars|website=Gibson.com|accessdate=August 30, 2019}}</ref> In 2013, Gibson also introduced a limited edition "Sheryl Crow [[Gibson Southern Jumbo|Southern Jumbo]]", a reissue of the slope-shouldered predecessor of the 1962-era Country Western.<ref name="auto"/>
