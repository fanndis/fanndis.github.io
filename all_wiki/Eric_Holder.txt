As Deputy Attorney General, Holder's primary responsibilities were in the areas of budget and personnel issues; this also included resolving disputes among department heads and briefing reporters on policy initiatives, national security issue, and major investigations,<ref name="MakingHistory"/> including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]] (FBI) investigations into allegations of [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|bribery and corruption in the 2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/1999-02-18/us/9902_18_justice.olympics_1_federal-probe-justice-department-bid?_s=PM:US |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130119114858/http://articles.cnn.com/1999-02-18/us/9902_18_justice.olympics_1_federal-probe-justice-department-bid?_s=PM:US |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 19, 2013 |title=Federal Probe of Salt Lake Olympic Bid Pretty Wide |date=February 18, 1999 |publisher=CNN }}</ref> Holder later advised Reno in the matters regarding the [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Independent Counsel statute]]. Reno made the decision to permit [[Kenneth Starr]] to expand his investigation into the [[Lewinsky affair]], leading to [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|Clinton's impeachment]].<ref name="MakingHistory"/>

In the wake of the murders of [[Matthew Shepard]] and [[Murder of James Byrd Jr.|James Byrd Jr.]], Holder was a vocal proponent of new [[hate crimes laws in the United States]]. Holder said that the current laws placed major constraints on the ability of federal investigators and prosecutors to assist in these types of cases.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/1999-03-12/politics/hate.crimes_1_crimes-bill-crimes-legislation-victims?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130119095836/http://articles.cnn.com/1999-03-12/politics/hate.crimes_1_crimes-bill-crimes-legislation-victims?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 19, 2013|title=Hate Crimes Legislation Introduced in Congress|date=March 12, 1999|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

In his final days with the [[Clinton administration]], Holder carried out his duties with [[Bill Clinton pardon controversy|Clinton's last-minute pardon]] of fugitive and Democratic contributor [[Marc Rich]]. Regarding discussions with the White House lawyers on the issue, Holder said he was at first "neutral" on the decision to grant Rich a pardon, but might lean in favor of it if there were national security benefits. Holder said that he was told that Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]] had asked Clinton to grant the pardon. Holder said that, at the time, he did not give the case much thought, because he did not think the pardon would be granted, as no fugitive had ever previously been granted a presidential pardon. He later said he wished that he had looked into it more thoroughly,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-02-08/justice/pardon.probe.03_1_evasion-and-illegal-oil-marc-rich-pincus-green?_s=PM:LAW |title=Holder Faces Grilling on Marc Rich Pardon |date=February 8, 2001 |publisher=CNN |access-date=August 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302160328/http://articles.cnn.com/2001-02-08/justice/pardon.probe.03_1_evasion-and-illegal-oil-marc-rich-pincus-green?_s=PM:LAW |archive-date=March 2, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> and expressed regret over the incident.

Republicans on the House Government Reform Committee disagreed with Holder's version and alleged that he was a knowing participant, according to a 2003 report. They said Holder failed to fully inform prosecutors of the pending pardon, and they criticized his "neutral leaning favorable" opinion to Clinton.<ref name=NYT_Cowan_20020313>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E3DB1239F930A25750C0A9649C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=Marc Rich Panel Says Top Justice Dept.

==Tenure as Attorney General of the United States==

===Terrorism===

====Defending U.S. drone strikes and raids====
As Attorney General, Holder was a staunch opponent of legal limitations on the executive branch's ability to prosecute the [[War on Terror]]. In May 2011, Holder testified before Congress on the legality of the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|operation in which U.S. special forces killed Osama bin Laden]] earlier that month. Holder testified that the operation to kill bin Laden was legal, stating that international law allows for targeting enemy commanders. To support this point, Holder said that computer evidence seized from the raid demonstrated that bin Laden was still leading [[al-Qaeda]]. Moreover, Holder said, the [[SEAL Team Six|Navy SEAL team]] that carried out the raid conducted itself in a manner consistent with American values, and that the parameters of the mission included capturing bin Laden.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13370919 |title=Bin Laden Death 'Not Assassination' – Eric Holder|date=May 12, 2011 | work=BBC News |access-date=May 6, 2019 }}</ref>

[[File:1201 National Security 06.jpg|thumb|Holder with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on December 2, 2008]]
Holder defended the legality of drone strikes against alleged terrorists. Addressing the death of [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], an American citizen who was killed by drone strike without [[trial]], Holder said "The U.S. government's use of lethal force in self-defense against a leader of al-Qaeda or an associated force who presents an imminent threat of violent attack would not be unlawful." He outlined a three-part test to affirm the lawfulness of the strikes: the terrorist poses an imminent threat of violence to the United States, capture is not possible and the operation is conducted in a manner consistent with the principles of the law of war.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/holder-speak-targeted-killings-americans/story?id=15851232 |title=Holder: When War on Terror Targets Americans|date=March 5, 2012}}</ref> At the time, al-Awlaki was an alleged leader and recruiter for [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]]. Holder later stated that "'[[due process|[d]ue process]]' and 'judicial process' are not one and the same, particularly when it comes to national security. The Constitution guarantees due process, not judicial process."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/03/holder-due-process-doesnt-necessarily-mean-courtroom/330933/ |title=Attorney General Holder: Due Process Doesn't Necessarily Mean a Courtroom |first=Adam |last=Martin |date=March 5, 2019 |access-date=May 6, 2019 }}</ref> Some civil liberties advocates have described the incident as "an extrajudicial execution" that breached al-Awlaki's right to due process, including a trial.<ref>{{cite web |last=Nelson |first=Steven |date=June 23, 2014 |title=Drone Memo Justifying Assassination of U.S. Citizen Released |website=U.S. News |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=U.S. News & World Report |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/06/23/drone-memo-assassination-us-citizen-anwar-al-awlaki-released |access-date=February 18, 2019}}</ref>

====Terrorism prosecutions====
A major legacy of Holder's tenure as attorney general was a shifting of terrorism cases to the civilian federal courts.<ref name="Apuzzo">Matt Apuzzo, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/us/a-holder-legacy-shifting-terror-cases-to-the-courts-and-winning.html A Holder Legacy: Shifting Terror Cases to the Civilian Courts, and Winning], ''New York Times'' (October 21, 2014).</ref><ref name="Olson">[http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/04/eric-holders-defining-legacy-on-terror-117446.html Eric Holder's Defining Legacy on Terror], ''Politico Magazine'' (April 28, 2015).</ref> Under Holder, the DOJ successfully tried many terrorists in federal court, securing convictions and life sentences against a string of defendants, including [[Sulaiman Abu Ghaith]] (Osama bin Laden's spokesman); [[Ahmed Ghailani]] (a conspirator in the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 East Africa bombings]]); and [[Abu Hamza]] (an al-Qaeda operative).<ref name="Apuzzo"/><ref name="Olson"/> [[Faisal Shahzad]] (the [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt|attempted Times Square bomber]]); and [[Omar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] (the failed "underwear bomber") pleaded guilty in federal court and were sentenced to life imprisonment during Holder's term.<ref>Phil Hirschkorn, [https://www.justsecurity.org/19000/federal-court-life-sentence-terrorism-abu-hamza-el-masri/ Another Life Sentence for a Terrorist Convicted in Federal Court], ''Just Security'' (January 9, 2015).</ref> During Holder's term, other terrorists&mdash;including [[Najibullah Zazi]] (who plotted a [[2009 New York City Subway and United Kingdom plot|New York subway attack]]), and [[Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame]] (an [[al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabab]] supporter) pleaded guilty and cooperated with the government.<ref name="Olson"/> Matt Olsen, the director of the [[National Counterterrorism Center]] from 2011 to 2014, wrote in 2015: "Through his persistence, Holder demonstrated the wisdom and value of prosecuting terrorists in civilian courts and cemented this approach for future administrations."<ref name="Olson"/>

In November 2009, Holder announced that [[September 11 attacks|September 11 attack]] co-conspirators&mdash;[[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], [[Ramzi Bin al-Shibh]], [[Walid bin Attash]], [[Ali Abdul Aziz Ali]] and [[Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi]]&mdash;would be tried in New York City on federal charges of conspiracy and murder.<ref name="Olson"/> Holder said at the time that the five would "stand trial in our justice system before an impartial jury under long-established rules and procedures."<ref name="Olson"/> This plan was frustrated by Congress, however, and "congressional restrictions on transferring Guantánamo detainees to federal court had delayed the case indefinitely."<ref name="Olson"/> In April 2011, Holder was forced to drop plans for a federal trial and instead refer the five to [[Guantanamo military commission|military commissions]]; at the time, Holder criticized Congress for interfering in the prosecution, saying: "[Congress has] taken one of the nation's most tested counterterrorism tools off the table and tied our hands in a way that would have serious ramifications."<ref>Sam Stein, [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/04/eric-holder-ksm-trial_n_844564.html Eric Holder Lashes Out at Congress Over Decision to Try KSM in Military Tribunal], ''Huffington Post'' (April 4, 2011).</ref> The military commissions remain "mired in procedural delays, legal uncertainty and continued controversy" today.<ref name="Olson"/>

====International cooperation against terrorism====
In July 2010, Holder attended a heads of state summit of the [[African Union]] in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]], where he told African leaders that the U.S. would continue to support the [[African Union Mission to Somalia|African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Attorney General Holder at the African Union Summit |url=https://www.justice.gov/ag/speeches/2010/ag-speech-100725.html |work=Justice.gov |date=July 25, 2010 |access-date=January 7, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Delany">Max Delany, [http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2010/jul/25/uganda-president-calls-for-africa-to-fight-terror/ Uganda president calls for Africa to fight terror], Associated Press (July 25, 2010).</ref> Holder also vowed to work closer with African officials to stop terrorism, and announced that the FBI would be providing a team of forensic specialists to help assist in the investigation of the [[July 2010 Kampala attacks|terrorist bombings in Kampala]] during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].<ref name="Delany"/>

In a July 2014 speech to diplomats, academics, and national security officials in [[Oslo]], Holder called for international cooperation against terrorism in Syria and Iraq in order to stem the flow of [[Foreign rebel fighters in the Syrian Civil War|foreign fighters]].<ref name="Phelps">Timothy M.

===Civil rights===

====Voting rights and redistricting====
Holder is a vocal proponent of defending the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, which was reauthorized in 2006 with bipartisan support. Holder has criticized new [[Voter ID laws in the United States|voter ID laws in Texas, Florida and other states]], which he suggests may be politically motivated. In 2011, Holder said, "The reality is that in jurisdictions across the country, both overt and subtle forms of discrimination remain all too common." He went on to  criticize Texas redistricting efforts, which were introduced when the state had increased its population by four million; Holder criticized the state for not allocating any new Congressional seats to represent Hispanic voters, arguing that the majority of the increased population were Latinos.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/elana-estrin/eric-holder-voting-rights_b_1149462.html |title=Holder Delivers Voting Rights Speech|work=Huffington Post|date=December 14, 2011|first=Elana|last=Estrin}}</ref>

Under Holder's tenure, the DOJ sued [[Shelby County, Alabama]], for a violation of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The small town of [[Calera, Alabama|Calera]] had re-drawn the city council districts without receiving pre-clearance from the DOJ, which was required by Section 5 in order to ensure that Southern states do not use such redistricting to weaken political representation for minority communities. For local elections, Calera had divided the African-American part of town, submerging it into two other districts. The DOJ argued that this eliminated the city's sole African-American councilman. Calera responded by arguing that the process of pre-clearance with the DOJ should no longer be required. On September 21, 2011, the federal district court upheld the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, but the decision was overturned by the Supreme Court in ''[[Shelby County v. Holder]]'', which effectively struck down Section 5 of the act. Before that decision, Holder had vowed to continue to enforce federal voting rights laws, regardless of how the United States Supreme Court decided in case.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/04/justice/holder-voting-rights-act/|publisher=CNN |title=Eric Holder: Supreme Court decision won't stop voting rights enforcement |date=April 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/04/eric-holder-martin-luther-king_n_3017258.html|work=Huffington Post |title=Eric Holder: Martin Luther King Jr. 'Would Not Yet Be Satisfied' With Voting Rights |date=April 4, 2013 |first=Ryan J. |last=Reilly}}</ref>

In May 2012, with over a dozen states pushing new voter identification laws, Holder stated that he believed these new laws would hamper the ability of the elderly, students and minorities to vote. Regarding voting rights, he said, "for the first time in our [lifetimes], we are failing to live up to one of our most noble ideals." Holder pledged that the DOJ fight these laws "aggressively". He went on to say that "We have to honor the generations that took extraordinary risks" to achieve the right to vote.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rollingout.com/politics/voting-rights-are-under-attack-says-attorney-general-eric-holder/ |title=Voting Rights Are Under Attack Says Attorney General|date=May 31, 2012}}</ref>

In a speech before the NAACP in July 2012, Holder went on to say that the Texas voter ID laws were a "political pretext to disenfranchise American citizens of their [[Voting rights in the United States|most precious right]]."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/07/holder-tells-naacp-texas-voter-id-law-hurts-minorities/ |title=Holder Tells NAACP Texas Voter ID Laws Hurt Minorities|work=USA Today| date=July 10, 2012}}</ref> Holder compared the practices of these states to those in the era of Jim Crow segregation. Holder said, "Many of those without IDs would have to travel great distances to get them – and some would struggle to pay for the documents they might need to obtain them. We call those [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]]."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0712/78352.html/|publisher=Politico.com |title=Holder Revs Up NAACP Meeting|date=July 10, 2012}}</ref>

====Arizona immigration law====
In May 2010, Holder expressed concerns over reports he had received regarding [[Arizona SB 1070]], an Arizona immigration law. He said that he feared that the law could lead to [[racial profiling]]. Holder received criticism on the political right for criticizing the law before he had read it in its entirety.<ref>{{cite news |title=Holder Is Criticized for Comments on Ariz. Immigration Law, Which He Hasn't Read |last=Markon |first=Jerry |date=May 14, 2010 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/14/AR2010051404231.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Holder Hasn't Read Arizona Law He Criticized |last=Dinan |first=Stephen |date=May 13, 2010 |work=[[The Washington Times]] |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/may/13/holder-hasnt-read-ariz-law-he-criticized/}}</ref>

In July 2010, after the DOJ reviewed the law, Holder filed suit against Arizona on the grounds that the state law is preempted by federal law. Holder was quoted as saying, "I understand, first off, the frustration of the people of Arizona and the concerns that they have with regard to the amount of illegal immigration that occurs, but the solution that the Arizona legislature came up with is inconsistent with our federal Constitution."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/07/10/ftn/main6666467.shtml |publisher=CBS News |title=Holder: Ariz. Law Inconsistent with Federal Law |date=July 10, 2010}}</ref>

A lawsuit challenging the law was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, and in June 2012, the Court struck down a majority of the law's provisions in ''[[Arizona v. United States]]''. Holder said that although he was pleased that much of the law had been struck down, he remained concerned over the burden it might place on local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration law and the possibility that it might be used to discriminate against the Latino community. He vowed to continue to monitor the impact of the law.<ref>https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/June/12-ag-801.html |publisher= US Department of Justice | date=June 25, 2012</ref>

Holder has also stated that he supports comprehensive immigration reform{{clarifyme|date=September 2020}}, adding that it is a "matter of civil rights and human rights".<ref>http://atlantablackstar.com/2013/04/27/eric-holder-citizenship-for-illegal-immigrants-is-a-matter-of-civil-and-human-rights/|{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} date=April 24, 2013</ref>

====Same-sex marriage====
In February 2011, Holder announced that the DOJ would no longer defend cases involving the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] in court. Holder had recommended this course of action to the President, arguing that the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional, as laws that prohibit the marriage of gay couples do not meet the legal principle of [[strict scrutiny]]. Holder cited changing law in support of his action: "Much of the legal landscape has changed in the 15 years since Congress passed DOMA. The Supreme Court has ruled that laws criminalizing homosexual conduct are unconstitutional. Congress has repealed the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. Several lower courts have ruled DOMA itself to be unconstitutional." This decision was prompted by legal deadlines in two federal cases in [[Connecticut]] and New York, where same-sex married couples argued that DOMA's ban on federal benefits to those in gay marriages approved by the individual states, violates the Constitution's requirement of equal treatment.<ref>{{cite web|date=February 23, 2011 |title=Statement of the Attorney General on Litigation Involving the Defense of Marriage Act |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-litigation-involving-defense-marriage-act |website=U.S. Department of Justice |publisher=Office of the Attorney General |access-date=September 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926053902/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-litigation-involving-defense-marriage-act |archive-date=September 26, 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20035398-503544.html/ |title=Obama Administration Will No Longer Defend DOMA |publisher=CBS News |date=February 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110224122017/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20035398-503544.html |archive-date=February 24, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

In February 2012, Holder reaffirmed his position and stated that the DOJ would not defend DOMA in a legal challenge brought by members of the U.S. military, who were seeking benefits for their same-sex spouses, including: medical insurance, visitation rights in military hospitals and survivor benefits.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/ag-holder-doj-wont-defend-a-challenge-to-doma-brought-by-members-of-military/|title=AG Holder: DOJ Won't Defend a Challenge to DOMA Brought by Members of Military|publisher=ABC News|date=February 17, 2012}}</ref>

Holder has also advocated for the interests of the 36,000 same-sex partnerships where Americans are in relationships with non-U.S. citizens. In May 2011, Holder set aside the decision to deport Paul Dorman, an Irish man who was in a same-sex partnership with a New Jersey citizen. Holder then asked immigration officials to reconsider their decision in order to determine whether Dorman can be considered a spouse under New Jersey law and whether Dorman would be considered a spouse under immigration law were it not for the Defense of Marriage Act. This action prompted some other immigration judges to halt the deportation proceeds of other foreigners in same-sex couples.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/06/30/deportation-citizens-same-sex-partner-canceled/ |title=Deportation of Citizen's Same-Sex Partner Canceled |date=June 30, 2011 | work=Fox News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/05/05/holder-intervenes-gay-mans-deportation-case/|title=Holder Intervenes in Gay Man's Deportation Case |archive-date=May 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520073103/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/05/05/holder-intervenes-gay-mans-deportation-case/}}</ref>

===Criminal investigations and prosecutions===

====Ted Stevens case====
In 2009, Holder decided to drop the [[Ted Stevens#Trial, conviction, and reversal|corruption case]] against former Senator [[Ted Stevens]] of Alaska after evidence of [[prosecutorial misconduct]] (specifically, the withholding of [[exculpatory evidence]]) emerged.<ref name="TedStevens">{{cite news |first=Nina |last=Totenberg |author-link=Nina Totenberg |title=Justice Dept.

In light of this conclusion, and in consideration of the totality of the circumstances of this particular case, I have determined that it is in the interest of justice to dismiss the indictment and not proceed with a new trial."<ref name="TedStevens"/> Judge Emmet Sullivan threw out the case several days later, issuing an order stating: "There was never a judgment of conviction in this case.

Lewis, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/02/us/politics/02stevens.html Justice Dept. Moves to Void Stevens Case], New York Times (April 1, 2009).</ref>

====Marijuana====
In 2010, in the run up to the referendum on [[California Proposition 19]], which would have legalized [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] use for personal recreation, Holder stated that the DOJ would continue to prosecute individuals on the federal level for possession of marijuana even if voters approved a ballot measure.<ref>{{cite news |title=Attorney General Holder Opposes California Marijuana Bill |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/16/us-usa-marijuana-california-idUSTRE69F03V20101016|work=Reuters|date=October 16, 2010}}</ref> However, in the run up to the successful marijuana legalization referendums on [[Colorado Amendment 64]] and [[Washington Initiative 502]] in 2012, Holder and the Department of Justice remained silent on how they would respond if the ballot measures were enacted by voters. On November 6, 2012, [[Colorado Amendment 64]] and [[Washington Initiative 502]] were passed with 55.3% and 55.7% of the votes respectively. This would lead to a new memo released by [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] [[James M.

====Leak investigations====
Under Holder's leadership, the Department of Justice brought six leak-related prosecutions against current or former U.S. government employees, while all previous Presidential administrations combined had tried a total of three such cases. Holder was reportedly "surprised" by news reports pointing out this statistic, and was said to have told associates that he did not wish to have leak prosecutions be his legacy.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/us/politics/accidental-path-to-record-leak-cases-under-obama.html?pagewanted=all |title=Administration Took Accidental Path to Setting Record for Leak Cases |last=Savage |first=Charlie |work=The New York Times |date=June 19, 2012 |access-date=March 15, 2013}}</ref> Several prominent leak prosecutions under Holder involved communications between criminal defendants and journalists, and the pervasive use of traceable electronic communications between journalists and their sources provided the prosecution with a tool to determine the potential origin of published information.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/a-high-tech-war-on-leaks.html?hpw=&pagewanted=all |title=A High-Tech War on Leaks |last=Liptak |first=Adam |work=The New York Times |date=February 11, 2012 |access-date=March 15, 2013}}</ref> Under Holder, the Justice Department argued that [[protection of sources|journalists had no legal protection to maintain the confidentiality of their sources]], and can be compelled by the government to reveal them, or potentially face criminal contempt charges.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/blog/secrecy/2012/02/no_privilege.html |title=There is No Reporter's Privilege, Leak Prosecutors Insist |last=Aftergood |first=Steven |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] Secrecy news |date=February 29, 2012 |access-date=February 29, 2012}}</ref> On September 17, 2018, the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]] obtained documents regarding the use of [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|FISA courts]] to spy on journalists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2018/09/17/journalists-fisa-court-spying/|title=Government Can Spy on Journalists in the U.S. Using Invasive Foreign Intelligence Process|last=Currier|first=Cora|date=September 17, 2018|website=The Intercept|language=en-US|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://reason.com/blog/2018/09/18/newly-released-eric-holder-memo-feds-can|title=Newly Released Eric Holder Memo: Feds Can Use FISA to Spy on Journalists|date=September 18, 2018|work=Reason.com|access-date=September 20, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://freedom.press/news/revealed-justice-depts-secret-rules-targeting-journalists-fisa-court-orders/|title=Revealed: The Justice Dept's secret rules for targeting journalists with FISA court orders|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>

On May 13, 2013, the [[Associated Press]] announced that the telephone records for 20 of their reporters during a two-month period in 2012 had been seized by the Justice Department as part of the [[2013 Department of Justice investigations of reporters]].

On August 12, 2013, at the [[American Bar Association]]'s House of Delegates meeting, Holder announced the "Smart on Crime" program, which is "a sweeping initiative by the Justice Department that in effect renounces several decades of tough-on-crime anti-drug legislation and policies."<ref name="ABA meeting Aug 12 2013">{{cite web |url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/sweeping_reversal_of_the_war_on_drugs_announced_by_atty_general_holder/?sc_cid=130815AR | title=Sweeping reversal of the War on Drugs announced by Atty General Holder |publisher=American Bar Association |work=ABA's 560-member policy making House of Delegates | date=August 12, 2013 | access-date=August 16, 2013 |author=Carter, Terry |page=1}}</ref><ref name="Reforming The Criminal Justice System Aug 12 2013">{{cite web | url=http://www.abajournal.com/files/SMART_ON_CRIME.PDF | title=Smart on Crime: Reforming The Criminal Justice System | publisher=US Department of Justice | work=Remarks to American Bar Association's Annual Convention in San Francisco, CA | date=August 12, 2013 | access-date=August 16, 2013 | page=7}}</ref> Holder said the program "will encourage U.S. attorneys to charge defendants only with crimes "for which the accompanying sentences are better suited to their individual conduct, rather than excessive prison terms more appropriate for violent criminals or drug kingpins…"<ref name="ABA meeting Aug 12 2013"/><ref name="Reforming The Criminal Justice System Aug 12 2013"/> Running through Holder's statements, the increasing economic burden of over-incarceration was stressed.<ref name="ABA meeting Aug 12 2013"/><ref name="Reforming The Criminal Justice System Aug 12 2013"/> {{As of | August 2013}}, the Smart on Crime program is not a legislative initiative but an effort "limited to the DOJ's policy parameters."<ref name="ABA meeting Aug 12 2013"/><ref name="Reforming The Criminal Justice System Aug 12 2013"/>

===Additional actions===
In 2009, Holder announced and oversaw the federal government spending of $1 billion in grants to law enforcement agencies in every state to pay for the hiring of police officers. The money comes from the stimulus bill the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] of 2009 and covered the salaries of 4,699 law enforcement officers for three years.<ref>{{cite news |title=US to Provide $1 billion to Hire cops |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-07-28/politics/police.stimulus_1_officers-for-three-years-police-officers-law-enforcement?_s=PM:POLITICS |publisher=CNN |date=July 28, 2009 |access-date=August 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312212050/http://articles.cnn.com/2009-07-28/politics/police.stimulus_1_officers-for-three-years-police-officers-law-enforcement?_s=PM:POLITICS |archive-date=March 12, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Grants and Resources for Community Policing |url=http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/default.asp?Item=2202 |date= July 28, 2009}}</ref>

After the U.S. government [[UBS AG#U.S. tax fraud controversy|filed suit]] against the Swiss bank [[UBS AG]], whom Holder had represented during his time in private practice, the attorney general recused himself from all legal matters concerning the bank, which stands accused of conspiracy in U.S. [[tax fraud]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2008676224_apholderbank.html |title=UBS bank listed among Holder ex-clients |work=The Seattle Times|date=January 27, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSWBT01077020090302|title=U.S., Swiss justice officials meet amid UBS probe |work=Reuters|date=March 2, 2009|first=Randall|last=Mikkelsen}}</ref>

Holder presented friend and predecessor [[Janet Reno]], Attorney General under the [[Clinton Administration]], the [[American Judicature Society]]'s (AJS) Justice Award on April 17, 2009.

After the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] in December 2010, Holder said that "We have an active, ongoing, criminal investigation with regard to this matter. We are not in a position as yet to announce the result of that investigation, but the investigation is—is ongoing. To the extent that we can find anybody who was involved in the breaking of American law and who has put at risk the assets and the people that I have described, they will be held responsible," Holder said. "They will be held accountable." Holder's comments leave open a crucial question, which is whether the investigators are looking at how WikiLeaks obtained the documents (not unlike probing a news organization's source), or if they're looking at whether WikiLeaks staffers violated criminal law and should be the ones indicted.<ref>{{cite web|last=McCullagh |first=Declan |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20024033-38.html#ixzz17XbldGQK |title=AG says WikiLeaks criminal probe is 'ongoing' |publisher=CNET |date=November 29, 2010 |access-date=January 7, 2012}}</ref> In May 2016, more than a year after leaving office, Holder told [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]] in an interview he thought [[Edward Snowden]] had "performed a public service by raising the debate that we engaged in and by the changes that we made", adding "I would say that doing what he did—and the way he did it—was inappropriate and illegal".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/30/politics/axe-files-axelrod-eric-holder/index.html |title=Eric Holder Says Edward Snowden Performed a 'Public Service' |first=Matthew |last=Jaffe |date=May 31, 2016 |publisher=CNN |access-date=June 12, 2016 }}</ref> Republican Senate Majority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] "lash[ed] out" at Holder, calling him "one of the worst attorneys general we've ever had" on ''[[Fox & Friends]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/281695-mcconnell-holder-one-of-the-worst-attorneys-general-ever |title=McConnell: Holder 'One of the Worst' Attorneys General Ever |first=Mark |last=Hensch |date=May 31, 2016 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |access-date=June 12, 2016 }}</ref>

He said the Justice Department has established a task force to look at each of the 172 detainees being held at the Guantánamo prison to address how they should be dealt with. Holder's comments come just weeks after CIA Director [[Leon Panetta]] told a Senate panel that Osama bin Laden would probably be shipped to and held at the Guantánamo Bay facility if he were captured.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yager |first=Jordy |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/146917-holder-gitmo-may-stay-open-beyond-2012 |title=Gitmo may stay open beyond 2012 |website=Thehill.com |access-date=January 7, 2012}}</ref>

"Though race-related issues continue to occupy a significant portion of our political discussion, and though there remain many unresolved racial issues in this nation, we, average Americans, simply do not talk enough with each other about things racial," he said.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/speeches/2009/ag-speech-090218.html?loc=interstitialskip|title=Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Attorney General Eric Holder at the Department of Justice African American History Month Program|agency=U.S. Department of Justice|date=February 18, 2009}}</ref>

====New Black Panther Party voter intimidation incident====
{{See also|New Black Panther Party voter intimidation case}}
[[File:Philadelphia polling place security patrols 2008.png|thumb|right|Alleged instance of voter intimidation in Philadelphia during the 2008 US presidential election.]]
In May 2009, Holder's Department of Justice completed a civil suit originally brought by [[J. Christian Adams]] of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Justice Department]] against the [[New Black Panther Party]], its chairman, and two of its members for [[voter intimidation]] due to their conduct during the 2008 election. Two members of the Party had stood outside a polling station during the election in paramilitary uniforms, one carrying a nightstick. Claiming a lack of evidence, the Department of Justice dropped charges against the party, its chairman, and one of the two members who had stood outside the polling station. With the evidence presented, the Department of Justice successfully obtained a narrow injunction against the other. Former lawyers who had served under the Bush Administration have stated that the current DOJ under Holder is unwilling to prosecute minorities for civil rights violations. Three other Justice Department lawyers, in recent interviews,{{When|date=January 2019}} gave the same description of the department's culture, which department officials strongly deny. In the months after the case ended, tensions persisted. Eventually, [[Christopher Coates]] (of the Justice's Civil Rights Division) acknowledged telling attorneys at a September 2009 lunch that the Obama administration was interested in filing cases – under a key voting rights section – only on behalf of minorities.<ref name="WP1">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/22/AR2010102203982.html "Dispute over New Black Panthers case causes deep divisions"]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 22, 2010.</ref>

During a meeting with a House subcommittee, Holder argued that the behavior of the New Black Panther Party was not comparable to historical voter intimidation against minorities, which often involved acts of violence and murder. Holder said, "When you compare what people endured in the South in the '60s to try to get the right to vote for African Americans, to compare what people subjected to that with what happened in Philadelphia… I think does a great disservice to people who put their lives on the line for my people."<ref name="gersteinpanther">{{cite news |first=Josh |last=Gerstein |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/0311/Eric_Holder_Black_Panther_case_focus_demeans_my_people.html|title=Eric Holder: Black Panther case focus demeans 'my people'|publisher=[[Politico]]|date=March 1, 2011|access-date=May 15, 2013}}</ref>

Republicans claimed some of those documents indicated that Holder had been sent early memos about Fast and Furious and therefore must have known about it before early 2011, which is when he'd testified he'd learned about it to the House Judiciary Committee;<ref>Fund, John and Von Spakovsky, Hans.

In April 2012, Issa announced that his committee was drafting a [[Contempt of Congress]] resolution against Holder in response to the committee allegedly being "stonewalled by the Justice Department" on additional documents.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/04/27/issa-chaffetz-confirm-contempt-plans-for-holder-over-fast-and-furious/ |title=Issa, Chaffetz confirm contempt plans for Holder over Fast and Furious |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=April 27, 2012 |access-date=April 28, 2012}}</ref>

On June 19, 2012, Holder met with Issa in person to discuss the requested documents. Holder said he offered to provide the documents to Issa on the condition that Issa provided his assurance that doing so would satisfy the committee subpoenas and resolve the dispute. Issa rejected the offer. Holder then told reporters "They rejected what I thought was an extraordinary offer on our part."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-06-19/politics/politics_holder-contempt_1_issa-contempt-vote-holder?_s=PM:POLITICS |title=Issa: Holder must turn over documents or face contempt vote |publisher=CNN |date=June 19, 2012 |access-date=August 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708233608/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-06-19/politics/politics_holder-contempt_1_issa-contempt-vote-holder?_s=PM:POLITICS |archive-date=July 8, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The congressional action evoked reactions from across the political spectrum. Texas governor and Republican presidential candidate [[Rick Perry]] called on Holder to resign, stating "America simply cannot tolerate an attorney general who arms the very criminals he is supposed to protect us from".<ref>{{cite web|author=Rick Perry |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/nov/21/eric-holder-must-go/ |title=Eric Holder must go |work=The Washington Times |date=November 21, 2011 |access-date=January 7, 2012}}</ref> Republican Sen.

In September 2012, after a nineteen-month review, the [[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General]] cleared the Attorney General of any wrongdoing with regard to Fast and Furious, stating that there was "no evidence" that Holder knew about the operation before early 2011.

===Refusal to prosecute financial institutions===
{{coatrack|date=September 2018}}
{{Main|Too big to fail}}

On March 6, 2013, Holder testified to the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] that the size of large financial institutions has made it difficult for the Justice Department to bring criminal charges when they are suspected of crimes, because such charges can threaten the existence of a bank and therefore their interconnectedness may endanger the national or global economy. (See [[financial contagion]]). "Some of these institutions have become too large," Holder told the Committee, "It has an inhibiting impact on our ability to bring resolutions that I think would be more appropriate."<ref name=Mattingly>{{cite news |last=Mattingly|first=Phil|title=Too-Big-to-Fail Banks Limit Prosecutor Options, Holder Says|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-06/too-big-to-fail-banks-limit-prosecutor-options-holder-testifies.html|access-date=March 14, 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=March 6, 2013}}</ref>

In a January 29, 2013 letter to Holder, Senators [[Sherrod Brown]] and [[Charles Grassley]] had criticized this Justice Department policy citing "important questions about the Justice Department's prosecutorial philosophy."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/business-economy-financial-crisis/untouchables/senators-bash-doj-for-evasive-response-on-too-big-to-jail/ |title=Senators Bash DOJ for "Evasive" Response on "Too Big To Jail" |last=Breslow |first=Jason |date=March 5, 2013 |access-date=March 18, 2013 |work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]}}</ref> After receipt of a DOJ response letter, Brown and Grassley issued a statement saying, "The Justice Department's response is aggressively evasive.

Nearly a decade later Holder, as head of the Department of Justice, put this into practice and has demonstrated the weight "collateral consequences" has by repeatedly sought and reached deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements and settlements with large financial institutions such as J.P. Morgan Chase, HSBC, Countrywide Mortgage, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and others where the institution pays a fine or penalty but faces no criminal charges and admits no wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.propublica.org/special/your-guide-to-the-latest-efforts-to-hold-big-banks-accountable|title=Your Guide to the Latest Efforts to Hold Big Banks Accountable |author=ProPublica|work=ProPublica|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630135155/https://www.propublica.org/special/your-guide-to-the-latest-efforts-to-hold-big-banks-accountable|archive-date=June 30, 2017}}</ref><ref>"The Divide" Matt Taibbi. 2014.</ref> Whereas in the previous decade the Bush administration's Department of Justice often sought criminal charges against individuals of large institutions regardless of "collateral consequences" such as cases involving [[Enron]], [[Adelphia Communications Corporation]], [[Tyco International]], and others.

In September 2014, he described the department's rationale in a speech at [[New York University]]:

{{quote|Responsibility remains so diffuse, and top executives so insulated," Holder said, "that any misconduct could again be considered more a symptom of the institution's culture than a result of the willful actions of any single individual."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-9-billion-witness-20141106|title=The $9 Billion Witness: Meet JPMorgan Chase's Worst Nightmare|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref>}}

According to a 2016 report prepared by Republican staff of the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Committee on Financial Services]], Holder and other Justice Department officials had overruled the recommendation of prosecutors to pursue criminal charges against [[HSBC]] for its alleged role in money-laundering, instead settling with the bank for the then-record amount of $1.9 billion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-overruled-recommendation-to-pursue-charges-against-hsbc-report-says-1468229401 |title=Justice Department Overruled Recommendation to Pursue Charges Against HSBC, Report Says |first=Christopher M. |last=Matthews |date=July 11, 2016 |work=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=September 8, 2018 }}</ref>

===Resolution proposing articles of impeachment===
On November 14, 2013, Representative Pete Olson (R-TX), along with 19 Republicans, introduced a resolution proposing articles of impeachment against Holder. The articles cited Holder for his alleged role in [[ATF gunwalking scandal|Operation Fast and Furious]], refusal to defend the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] in court, failing to prosecute anyone involved in the [[IRS targeting controversy|IRS targeting]] of groups based on name and political theme, and for allegedly perjuring himself by stating that he had no knowledge of any potential prosecution of members of the media for disclosure of classified material.<ref name=hr411>{{cite web |url= http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hres411ih/pdf/BILLS-113hres411ih.pdf|title=H.

In July 2015, Holder rejoined [[Covington & Burling]], the law firm at which he worked before becoming Attorney General. The law firm's clients have included many of the large banks Holder declined to prosecute for their alleged role in the financial crisis. [[Matt Taibbi]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' opined about the move, "I think this is probably the single biggest example of the [[Revolving door (politics)|revolving door]] that we've ever had."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2015/7/8/eric_holder_returns_to_wall_street |title=Matt Taibbi: Eric Holder Back to Wall Street-Tied Law Firm After Years of Refusing to Jail Bankers |date=July 8, 2015 |work=[[Democracy Now!]] |access-date=July 9, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/eric-holder-wall-street-double-agent-comes-in-from-the-cold-20150708 |author=[[Matt Taibbi]]|title=Eric Holder, Wall Street Double Agent, Comes in From the Cold |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]| date=July 8, 2015 |access-date=July 10, 2015}}</ref>

In early 2016, Holder was hired by the [[MTN Group]], a South Africa-based telecommunications company as a part of its efforts to combat a $3.9 billion fine handed to the MTN Group by the government of [[Nigeria]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailypost.ng/2016/02/03/3-9b-fine-mtn-hires-ex-u-s-attorney-general-to-challenge-ncc/|title=$3.9b fine: MTN hires ex-U.S attorney general to challenge NCC|last=Ogbeche|first=Danielle|date=2016-02-03|website=Daily Post Nigeria|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> Rather than attempt to negotiate with the regulatory body that issued the fine, the [[Nigerian Communications Commission|Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC)]], Holder worked with the Nigerian Attorney General [[Abubakar Malami]] to reach a compromise. While the NCC initially rejected a proposal from Malami for a reduced fine, it later decided to reduce the fine by more than half. The MTN Group paid the reduced amount, which totaled around $1.7 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-mtn-idUSKCN0ZH45I|title=How MTN sliced billions off its Nigerian telecoms fine|date=2016-07-01|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-01-24|language=en}}</ref>

In October 2016, Holder announced that he would chair the newly incorporated [[National Democratic Redistricting Committee]], a group aiming to support Democratic candidates in state races ahead of the redistricting that will follow the [[2020 United States Census|2020 Census]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dovere|first1=Edward-Isaac|title=Obama, Holder to lead post-Trump redistricting campaign|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obama-holder-redistricting-gerrymandering-229868|website=Politico|access-date=November 12, 2016}}</ref>

During 2018, Holder suggested on several occasions that he might run for the presidency in 2020. In July, he told CNN he thought a presidential candidate needed five qualities—the ability to inspire others, a vision for the job, the ability to meet both the physical and mental strains of the job, and appropriate experience. Holder added that he believed he possessed those five qualities, but noted that his wife would be involved in his decision.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/399406-eric-holder-yeah-im-interested-in-white-house-bid |title=Eric Holder: 'Yeah, I'm interested' in White House bid |first=Brett |last=Samuels |date=July 29, 2018 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |access-date=September 15, 2018 }}</ref> On March 4, 2019, Holder announced that he would not seek the White House in 2020 but would continue his work with the National Democratic Redistricting Committee to help elect a Democratic candidate who had the five qualities he thought were necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/eric-holder-i-wont-run-but-i-will-fight-to-elect-the-right-democratic-president/2019/03/02/9aeeed56-3c47-11e9-aaae-69364b2ed137_story.html |title=Eric Holder: I won't run, but I will fight to elect the right Democratic president |first=Eric |last=Holder |date=March 4, 2019 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=March 6, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2019/3/4/18249870/eric-holder-president-2020 |title=Former Attorney General Eric Holder: 'I will not run for president in 2020' |first=Li |last=Zhou |date=March 4, 2019 |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |access-date=March 6, 2019 }}</ref>
