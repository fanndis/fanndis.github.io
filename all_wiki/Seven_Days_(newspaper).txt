== History ==
Seven Days was founded in 1995 by reporters Pamela Polston and Paula Routly.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Joyce|first=Marcel|date=September 1, 2001|title=Pamela Polston and Paula Routly of Seven Days|journal=Vermont Business Magazine|volume=29|pages=16}}</ref> The original capital investment of $68,000 by angel investors was repaid within three years.<ref name=":0" /> Originally the paper's title was going to be the ''Vermont Voice'', however a dispute over the name caused them to settle on ''Seven Days'' instead.<ref name=":0" /> Circulation of the newspaper in 1995 was around 12,000.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|title=Seven Days Increases Circulation to 36,000|date=July 23, 2013|work=Targeted News Service}}</ref>

Angelo Lynn, owner and publisher of the ''[[Addison County Independent]]'' (a local newspaper based in [[Middlebury, Vermont|Middlebury, VT]]) was a valued mentor to the pair of owners as they got their start.<ref name=":0" />

From 1995 - 2002 ''Seven Days'' saw a 20% increase in revenue each year.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kelley|first=Kevin|date=February 1, 2002|title=New media plugged into Chittenden County|journal=Vermont Business Magazine|volume=30|pages=69|via=ProQuest US Newsstream}}</ref>

In 2013 ''Seven Days'' expanded its weekly circulation to 36,000 by including the Northeast Kingdom in its distribution radius.<ref name=":1" />

In 2019, Seven Days hired reporter Kate O'Neill to launch a year-long project reporting on the opioid epidemic in Vermont.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vermontbiz.com/people/january/seven-days-hires-kate-o%E2%80%99neill-new-reporting-project-opioid-epidemic|title=Seven Days hires Kate Oâ€™Neill for a new reporting project on the opioid epidemic|date=2019-01-22|website=Vermont Business Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-06-21}}</ref>
