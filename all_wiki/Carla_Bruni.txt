Following months of speculation, in a television interview broadcast on 23 November 2009, Bruni revealed that she had accepted a role in a forthcoming [[Woody Allen]] film. She admitted her reasoning for embarking on the Paris production;  "I'm not an actress at all. Perhaps I'll be completely hopeless but I can't miss an opportunity like this one.

Italian singer/songwriter [[Simone Cristicchi]]'s entry in the 2010 [[Festival della canzone italiana|San Remo Italian Song Festival]] was the song "Meno Male", with the chorus lyrics of "Meno male che c'è Carla Bruni" ("Thank goodness for Carla Bruni"). The song appears to mock Bruni and her husband, but Cristicchi stated in an interview for Italian television weekly ''[[TV Sorrisi e Canzoni]]'' "I use sarcasm to explain our Italian way of always wanting to follow any type of gossip without being interested in real problems."<ref>[http://www.sorrisi.com/2010/02/10/simone-cristicchi-secondo-me-son-tutti-matti/ "Simone Cristicchi – Secondo me son tutti matti"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124181126/http://www.sorrisi.com/2010/02/10/simone-cristicchi-secondo-me-son-tutti-matti/ |date=24 November 2010 }} ''TV Sorrisi e Canzoni''. 10 February 2010</ref> Bruni was to be a guest singer at the 2010 San Remo festival but withdrew from participating.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/7136849/Carla-Bruni-withdraws-from-festival-over-Sarkozy-song.html "Carla Bruni withdraws from festival 'over Sarkozy song{{'"}}].

Although constitutionally, Bruni had no official role within government, she assisted her husband with a number of official obligations.

In 2008, Bruni caused controversy when she spoke against the extradition of [[Marina Petrella]], an Italian far-left terrorist. Petrella had murdered a police commissioner and assisted in the kidnapping of Italian politician, [[Aldo Moro]]. Petrella had been living in France since 1993 and had not been extradited due to the [[Mitterrand doctrine]]. Sarkozy eventually chose not to extradite Petrella.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/08_ottobre_16/caso_petrella_magris_9c80a008-9b5b-11dd-a5ca-00144f02aabc.shtml|title=Non siamo un paese di barbari – Corriere della Sera|website=www.corriere.it|language=it|access-date=22 July 2017}}</ref>

=== Political views ===
[[File:PR-2012-05-15 IMG 1728.jpg|thumb|Nicholas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni leaving the Elysee Palace, 15 May 2012]]
Bruni's political views have been inconsistent over the years though she defines herself as a left-winger. She has defended [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] numerous times since becoming the First Lady of France and leaving the office.

During the [[2007 French presidential election|2007 French Presidential Election]], Bruni stated that she would have voted for [[Ségolène Royal]] who was running against her future husband, [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Nicholas Sarkozy]]. Bruni said her lack of French Citizenship disallowed her from voting but she would have voted left wing due to it being family tradition.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/medias/20071218.OBS0821/carla-bruni-je-voterai-toujours-a-gauche.html|title=Carla Bruni : "Je voterai toujours à gauche"|work=L'Obs |language=fr-FR |access-date=22 July 2017}}</ref> In an October 2011 interview with the British newspaper ''[[Sunday Herald|The Sunday Herald]],'' Bruni said "My family have always voted to the left.

In an interview with ''[[Le Point]]'', Bruni said, when asked about her political leanings, "I am left wing, but I'm not against my husband or his party. I am not an activist." In a May 2011 interview with ''[[Le Parisien]]'', Bruni said she no longer felt left wing and identified as an ultra-Sarkozyist.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/politique/carla-bruni-sarkozy-je-suis-ultra-sarkozyste-02-05-2011-1431610.php|title=Carla Bruni-Sarkozy : "Je suis ultra-sarkozyste"|date=2 May 2011|work=leparisien.fr|access-date=22 July 2017}}</ref>

=== Marriage to Nicolas Sarkozy ===
[[File:Michelle obama and carla bruni sarkozy.jpg|left|thumb|Carla Bruni with [[Michelle Obama]], 3 April 2009]]
Bruni met the recently divorced French president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] in November 2007, at a dinner party.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/13/france.alexduvalsmith "France begins to grow weary with the Sarkozy soap opera"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. 13 January 2008.</ref> After a brief romance they married on 2 February 2008 at the [[Élysée Palace]] in Paris. The marriage is Bruni's first and Sarkozy's third.  Bruni obtained French nationality not long afterwards.<ref name="Lefigaro"/> She has since made contradictory statements as to whether she still holds Italian [[citizenship]] as well.<ref>[http://www.marianne2.fr/Carla-Bruni-Sarkozy-son-pays,-elle-l-aime-mais-elle-le-quitte!_a174453.html "Carla Bruni Sarkozy: son pays, elle l'aime... mais elle le quitte!"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221113530/http://www.marianne2.fr/Carla-Bruni-Sarkozy-son-pays,-elle-l-aime-mais-elle-le-quitte!_a174453.html |date=21 February 2009 }} – [[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]] 17 January 2009 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> On 28 April 2014 episode of the ''Ellen DeGeneres Show'', she confirmed that she still holds Italian citizenship.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-6mOr3epl8 "Carla Bruni Meets Ellen"]. 28 April 2014. Via YouTube.</ref> Besides her native Italian, Bruni can speak fluent English and French.

Following her marriage to Sarkozy, in February 2008, Bruni continued accompanying him on state visits, including to the United Kingdom in March 2008, which created a sensation in the international press and for the public in both Britain and France.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/7316345.stm ''BBC News In Pictures – Carla Bruni-Sarkozy'']. [[BBC News]]. 27 March 2008.</ref> She had an office and staff at her disposal in the East wing of the [[Élysée Palace]].<ref>[http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualites/2008/04/03/01001-20080403ARTFIG00405-confidentiel-carla-prend-ses-quartiers-a-l-elysee.php "Confidentiel : Carla prend ses quartiers à l'Élysée"]. ''[[Le Figaro]]''. 3 April 2008. {{in lang|fr}}.</ref>

There was controversy on the eve of the state visit to the UK, with the publication by Christie's auction house of a nude photograph of Bruni taken during her career as a model. The photograph sold for $91,000.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSHAR16156120080411?feedType=RSS&feedName=oddlyEnoughNews "Nude Bruni photo sells for $91,000 in auction"]. Reuters, 11 April 2008.</ref> There was also great interest in Bruni's wardrobe, which was [[Christian Dior]], seen as a diplomatic choice, since Dior is a French design house but the wardrobe was designed by [[John Galliano]], a British designer.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/26/wsarko826.xml "Carla Bruni styled by Englishman John Galliano"]. ''The Daily Telegraph'', 27 March 2008.</ref> Another controversy was the use of a popular photo of the French President and Bruni in the print advertising of [[Ryanair]]. The couple was awarded damages by a French court,<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1577810/Carla-Bruni-awarded-damages-from-Ryanair.html "Carla Bruni awarded damages from Ryanair"]. ''The Daily Telegraph'', 7 February 2008</ref> which they donated to ''[[Restaurants du Cœur|Les Restos du Cœur]]'', an organisation that provides meals to the homeless.

In December 2008, Bruni sued the makers of a bag featuring a nude shot taken during her youth. Clothes designer Pardon has produced 10,000 of the shopping bags emblazoned with the nude photo taken in 1993, showing Bruni staring at the camera with her crossed hands covering her crotch.<ref name="Pardon">[http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG3724281/French-first-lady-Carla-Bruni-Sarkozy-sues-bag-makers-Pardon-over-nude-image.html "French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy sues bag makers Pardon over nude image"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 12 December 2008.</ref>

In late August 2010, Iran's state-run daily paper ''[[Kayhan]]'' called Bruni a 'prostitute' after she had condemned the stoning sentence against [[Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani]] for adultery in an open letter, along with several French celebrities, including actress [[Isabelle Adjani]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/7971078/Iran-calls-Carla-Bruni-a-prostitute.html |title=Iran calls Carla Bruni a 'prostitute' |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Ian Black, Middle East editor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/31/carla-bruni-sarkozy-iranian-media|title=Iranian media warned after paper calls Carla Bruni-Sarkozy a 'prostitute'|work=The Guardian|location=London |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref> The paper later also called for Bruni to be put to death for supporting Sakineh Ashtiani, and for what the paper described as Bruni's moral corruption and having had extra-marital affairs herself. Even though ''Kayhan'' is a state-sponsored paper that, along with other state-run Iranian media, continued its tirade against Bruni, Iranian officials tried to distance themselves from that violent stance and openly condemned it, while a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry criticized the comments as being 'unacceptable'.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/09/01/iran.bruni.ashtiani/index.html?iref=allsearch#fbid=e5OtQFoGK7h&wom=false|publisher=CNN|title=Iranian newspaper says French first lady deserves to die|date=2 September 2010}}</ref> Then-President of Iran [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] also condemned the remark made by the paper.<ref>[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/ahmadinejad-says-bruni-insult-a-crime-20100919-15hvn.html "Ahmadinejad says Bruni insult a 'crime{{'"}}].

On 19 October 2011, Bruni gave birth to a daughter, Giulia, in the ''Clinique de la Muette'', in Paris.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130213181156/http://www.lepoint.fr/ces-gens-la/carla-bruni-sarkozy-et-sa-fille-giulia-sont-sorties-de-la-clinique-de-la-muette-23-10-2011-1388104_264.phpCarla%20Bruni-Sarkozy%20et%20sa%20fille%20Giulia%20sont%20sorties%20de%20la%20clinique%20de%20la%20Muette "Carla Bruni-Sarkozy et sa fille Giulia sont sorties de la clinique de la Muette"].
