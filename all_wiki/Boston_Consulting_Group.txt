==History==
The firm was founded in 1963 by [[Bruce Henderson]] as part of The Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company. Henderson had been recruited from [[Arthur D. Little]] to establish the consulting arm operating as a subsidiary under the name Management and Consulting Division of the Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company. Initially the division only advised clients of the bank, with billings for the first month at just US$500. Henderson hired his second consultant, Arthur P. Contas, in December 1963.<ref name="hendersonobit">{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/24/us/bruce-henderson-77-consultant-and-writer-on-business-strategy.html|title=Bruce Henderson, 77, Consultant And Writer on Business Strategy|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> In 1966, BCG opened its second office in Tokyo, Japan.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tokyo 2020 welcomes Boston Consulting Group K.K. as Official Supporter |url=https://tokyo2020.org/en/news/tokyo-2020-welcome-the-boston-consulting-group-k-k |website=Tokyo 2020 |accessdate=6 August 2020}}</ref>

In 1967, Henderson met [[Bill Bain (consultant)|Bill Bain]] and offered him a role at the firm. Bain agreed and joined in 1967 at a starting salary of $17,000 per year.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news |last=Gallese|first=Liz Roman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/24/magazine/counselor-to-the-king.html |title=Counselor To The King |work=The New York Times |date=September 24, 1989|accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref><ref name="naples">{{cite news |url=http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2008/jan/28/dinners7/ |title=Wine Festival 2008: McNulty/Bain |work=Naples Daily News |date=January 28, 2008|accessdate=August 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030102217/http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2008/jan/28/dinners7/|archive-date=October 30, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="WSJ">{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/william-bain-jr-founded-consulting-and-private-equity-firms-and-groomed-mitt-romney-1516236137|work=The Wall Street Journal|title=William Bain Jr. Founded Consulting and Private-Equity Firms, and Groomed Mitt Romney|date=January 17, 2018|first=James R.|last=Hagerty|accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref> In the early 1970s, Bain was considered internally to be Henderson's eventual successor. However, in 1973 Bain resigned from BCG to start his own strategy consulting firm, [[Bain & Company]], hiring away six of BCG's employees.<ref name="nytimes" /><ref name="naples" />

In 1974, Henderson arranged an [[employee stock ownership]] plan so that the employees could make the company independent from The Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company. The buyout of all shares was completed in 1979.<ref name="IDCH">{{cite book|last=Gant|first=Tina|title=International Directory of Company Histories|date=December 2003|publisher=[[St. James Press]]|isbn=978-1-55862-503-7|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/the-boston-consulting-group-history/|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>

===Interview process===
BCG uses the [[case method]] to conduct interviews. This technique is designed to simulate the types of problems inherent in [[management consulting]] and to test the qualitative and quantitative skills deemed important for abstract thinking in a business setting.<ref name="bcginterviewprep">{{cite web|url=https://www.bcg.com/en-us/careers/roles/consulting/interview-resources.aspx|title=Consultant Interview Preparation and Practice Cases|publisher=bcg.com|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> Generally, the interview process consists of two rounds.<ref name="casecoach">{{cite web|url=https://casecoach.com/b/whats-different-between-a-first-round-and-final-round-interview-at-bain-bcg-or-mckinsey/|title=What's Different Between a First Round and Final Round Interview at Bain, BCG or McKinsey|publisher=casecoach.com|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>

==BCG growth-share matrix==
[[image:growthsharematrix.png|thumb|right|180px]]

In the 1970s, BCG created and popularized the "[[growth–share matrix]]," a chart to help large corporations decide how to allocate cash among their business units. The corporation would categorize its business units as "Stars," "Cash Cows," "Question Marks," or "Dogs," and then allocate cash accordingly, moving money from Cash Cows toward Stars and Question Marks, which have higher market growth rates and hence greater upside potential.<ref name="smartinsights">{{cite web|url=https://www.smartinsights.com/marketing-planning/marketing-models/use-bcg-matrix/|title=How to use the BCG Matrix model|publisher=smartinsights.com|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref><ref name="businessnews">{{cite web|url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5693-bcg-matrix.html|title=What Is a BCG Matrix?|publisher=businessnewsdaily.com|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>

== Controversy ==

=== Angola ===
An article published by ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 19, 2020 identified the Boston Consulting Group as having facilitated [[Isabel dos Santos|Isabel dos Santos's]] exploitation of Angola's natural resources while the country suffers from poverty, illiteracy, and infant mortality.<ref name=":02">{{Cite news|last=Forsythe|first=Michael|last2=Gurney|first2=Kyra|last3=Alecci|first3=Scilla|last4=Hallman|first4=Ben|date=2020-01-19|title=How U.S. Firms Helped Africa’s Richest Woman Exploit Her Country’s Wealth|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/19/world/africa/isabel-dos-santos.html|access-date=2020-01-19|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> According to the article, BCG was contracted by the Angolan state-owned petroleum company [[Sonangol Group|Sonangol]], as well as the jewelry company [[De Grisogono]], owned by her husband through shell companies in Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands; the firm was reportedly paid through offshore companies in tax havens such as Malta.<ref name=":02" />

=== Saudi Arabia ===
''The New York Times'' also reported that Boston Consulting Group is one of the consulting firms, along with [[McKinsey & Company|McKinsey]] and [[Booz Allen Hamilton|Booz Allen]], helping Prince [[Mohammed bin Salman]] consolidate power in [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Forsythe|first=Michael|last2=Mazzetti|first2=Mark|last3=Hubbard|first3=Ben|last4=Bogdanich|first4=Walt|date=2018-11-04|title=Consulting Firms Keep Lucrative Saudi Alliance, Shaping Crown Prince’s Vision|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/world/middleeast/mckinsey-bcg-booz-allen-saudi-khashoggi.html|access-date=2020-06-22|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> While a BCG spokesperson said the firm turns down projects involving military and intelligence strategy, BCG is involved in designing the economic blueprint for the country, a plan called [[Saudi Vision 2030|Vision 2030]].<ref name=":0" />

=== Sweden ===
Boston Consulting Group has received substantial criticism for their involvement in the construction of the [[Karolinska University Hospital|The New Karolinska Solna University Hospital]] after an investigation by [[Dagens Nyheter]]. Specifically the potential conflict of interest where a former BCG employee and then hospital executive approved numerous expenses without proper receipts and the high cost paid for external consultants including BCG.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Knoxborn |first1=Ellinor |title=Skandalerna som kantat Nya Karolinska |url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/stockholm/nks |work=[[Sveriges Television]] |date=4 September 2018|accessdate=2020-08-21|language=sv}}</ref> In the [[investigative journalism]] book ''Konsulterna - Kampen om Karolinska'' (roughly ''The Consultants - The Struggle for the Karolinska University Hospital''), the authors and Dagens Nyheter journalists Anna Gustavsson and Lisa Röstlund argue that the [[value-based health care]] model as recommended by BCG had not been properly investigated and have resulted in an exponential growth in administration and lack of responsibility for patients.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gustafsson |first1=Anna |last2=Röstlund |first2=Lisa |title=Konsulterna : Kampen om Karolinska. |date=2019 |publisher=Mondial |isbn=9789189061217 |pages=20 |language=sv |chapter=1.
