{{Northwest Airlines Flight 253}}
'''Northwest Airlines Flight 253''' was an international passenger flight from [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] in the Netherlands, to [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]] in the United States. The flight was the target of a failed [[al-Qaeda]] bombing attempt on [[Christmas Day]], December&nbsp;25, 2009, in which a passenger tried to set off [[chemical explosive]]s sewn to his underwear.  There were 290 people on board the aircraft&mdash;an [[Airbus A330#Airbus A330-300|Airbus A330-323E]] operated by [[Northwest Airlines]], which had merged with [[Delta Air Lines]] the year before.  Had the attempt succeeded, it would have surpassed [[American Airlines Flight 191]] as the deadliest [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aviation occurrence]] on U.S. soil and tied [[Iran Air Flight 655]] as the eighth-deadliest of all time.  The incident was also the second in 2009 involving an Airbus A330, after the crash of [[Air France Flight 447]] on June&nbsp;1. This was also the final accident/incident involving [[Northwest Airlines]] as it closed down a month later when it merged with [[Delta Air Lines]].

A Dutch passenger, [[#Jasper Schuringa|Jasper Schuringa]], tackled and restrained him and put out the fire with the aid of others. Abdulmutallab was handcuffed while the pilot safely landed the plane. In all, three people were injured: Abdulmutallab, Schuringa, and one other passenger. Upon landing in Detroit, Abdulmutallab was arrested and taken to a hospital for treatment of his burns. On December&nbsp;28, 2009, [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP) claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing. On January&nbsp;6, 2010, a federal [[grand jury]] [[indictment|indicted]] Abdulmutallab on six criminal charges, including attempted use of a [[weapon of mass destruction]] and [[attempted murder]].

Reports indicated that the U.S. had received intelligence regarding a powder bomb planned attack by a [[Yemen]]-based [[Nigeria]]n man. While describing security measures taken by U.S. and foreign governments in the immediate aftermath of the attack, [[U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security]], [[Janet Napolitano]], said, "once the incident occurred, the system worked." She cited "the actions of the passengers and the crew on this flight" to show "why that system is so important."<ref name="This Week system worked"/> After heavy criticism, she stated the following day that the system "failed miserably", this time referring to Abdulmutallab's boarding the flight with an explosive device.<ref name="Reuters system failed miserably">{{vcite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BQ0Z420091228|title=System to keep air travel safe failed: Napolitano|author=Charles, Deborah|date=December 28, 2009|agency=Reuters|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=March 17, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126163550/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BQ0Z420091228|archivedate=January 26, 2010}}</ref> U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] called the U.S.'s failure to prevent the bombing attempt "totally unacceptable", and ordered an investigation.<ref name="Telegraph Obama totally unacceptable">{{vcite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/6908709/Barack-Obama-admits-unacceptable-systemic-failure-in-Detroit-plane-attack.html|title=Barack Obama admits 'unacceptable systemic failure' in Detroit plane attack|author=Allen, Nick|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=The Daily Telegraph (UK)|accessdate=March 17, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302005458/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/6908709/Barack-Obama-admits-unacceptable-systemic-failure-in-Detroit-plane-attack.html|archivedate=March 2, 2010}}</ref>

In a public test conducted by the [[BBC]], the test plane's [[fuselage]] remained intact, indicating that the bomb would not have destroyed the aircraft, though it did show window damage that would likely have led to cabin depressurization.

The U.S. also increased the installation and use of full-body scanners in many of its major airports as a result of the attack. The scanners are designed to be able to detect bombs under clothing, and 11 airports, including [[O'Hare International Airport]] in Chicago, began to receive the machines in March 2010. The TSA said that it had plans to have 1,000 of the machines in airports by the end of 2011. Before, the U.S. had only 40 scanners across 19 airports. The government also said that it planned to buy 300 additional scanners in 2010 and another 500 in the following [[fiscal year]], starting October 2010. It costs around an estimated $530 million to purchase the 500 machines and hire over 5,300 workers to operate them. However, the U.S. government has stated that being scanned is voluntary and that passengers who object to the process could choose to undergo a pat-down search or be searched with hand-held detectors.<ref name="Bloomberg body scanners">{{vcite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-05/u-s-adding-body-scanners-at-11-airports-napolitano-says.html|title=U.S. Adding Full-Body Bomb Scanners at 11 Airports (Update3)|author=Hughes, John|date=March 5, 2010|publisher=Bloomberg L.P|work=BusinessWeek|accessdate=March 14, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206142804/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-05/u-s-adding-body-scanners-at-11-airports-napolitano-says.html|archivedate=February 6, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Chicago Tribune body scanners">{{vcite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/ct-met-airport-body-scanner-20100223,0,3580465.story |title=Full-body scanner arriving at O'Hare |author=Mack, Kristen |date=February 24, 2010 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |publisher=Tribune Company |accessdate=March 14, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227024929/http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/ct-met-airport-body-scanner-20100223%2C0%2C3580465.story |archivedate=February 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> Under new rules prompted by the incident, airline passengers traveling to the U.S. from 14 nations would undergo extra screening: [[Afghanistan]], [[Algeria]], [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], and [[Yemen]].

He called the situation "totally unacceptable."<ref>{{vcite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8434275.stm |title=US President Obama notes "system failure" over jet bomb |publisher=BBC News |date=December 29, 2009 |accessdate=December 29, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230052211/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8434275.stm |archivedate=December 30, 2009 }}</ref> He ordered that a report be delivered detailing how some government agencies had failed to share or highlight potentially relevant information about the suspect before he allegedly tried to blow up the airliner.<ref>{{vcite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/30/AR2009123003229.html?hpid=topnews |title=Obama to get report on intelligence failures in Abdulmutallab case |author=Karen DeYoung |publisher=The Washington Post |date=December 31, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106023622/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/30/AR2009123003229.html?hpid=topnews |archivedate=January 6, 2010 }}</ref> Two days later Obama received the briefing, which included statements that information about the suspect had failed to cross agency lines, and that the failures to communicate within the U.S. government had led to the threat posed by Abdulmutallab not being known by certain agencies until the attack. Obama said he would meet with security officials and specifically question why Abdulmutallab was not placed on the U.S. [[no-fly list]], despite the government having received warnings about his potential al-Qaeda links.<ref>{{vcite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8436459.stm|title=Obama briefed on plane bomb security lapses|publisher=BBC News|date=December 31, 2009|accessdate=December 31, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101052623/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8436459.stm|archivedate=January 1, 2010}}</ref>

On January 27, 2010, an official from the U.S. State Department said that Abdulmutallab's visa was not revoked because federal authorities believed that it would have compromised a larger investigation. The official, [[Patrick F. Kennedy]], said intelligence officials had told the State Department that letting Abdulmutallab keep his visa would allow for a greater chance of exposing the terrorist network.<ref name="Detroit News kept visa">{{vcite news|url=http://detnews.com/article/20100127/NATION/1270405/Terror-suspect-kept-visa-to-avoid-tipping-off-larger-investigation|title=Terror suspect kept visa to avoid tipping off larger investigation|title2=Terror suspect's visa kept valid for larger probe, hearing told|author=Hurst, Nathan|date=January 27, 2010|work=The Detroit News|publisher=The Detroit News|accessdate=March 26, 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} [http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=S3wcGUjH Alt URL]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg56189/html/CHRG-111hhrg56189.htm|title=Flight 253 : learning lessons from an averted tragedy : hearing before the Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, One Hundred Eleventh Congress, second session, January 27, 2010.|author=United States House Committee on Homeland Security.|date=January 27, 2010|publisher=[[US GPO|United States Government Printing Office]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65cE9axWR?url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-111hhrg56189/html/CHRG-111hhrg56189.htm|archivedate=February 21, 2012|url-status=live|quote=We were ready to revoke the visa.

===Alleged subsequent plot===
On May 7, 2012, American officials claimed that they had thwarted another Al Qaeda plot that would have targeted a civilian passenger plane not unlike Northwest Airlines Flight 253.<ref name="cushman">Cushman, John H. Jr., "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/08/world/middleeast/us-says-terrorist-plot-to-attack-plane-foiled.html U.S. Thwarted New Qaeda Plot to Attack Plane, Officials Say] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325215113/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/08/world/middleeast/us-says-terrorist-plot-to-attack-plane-foiled.html |date=March 25, 2017 }}", ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 7, 2012.</ref> American officials stated that the attack would have involved a more sophisticated bomb, also planted in undergarments, and would have been deployed near the anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden. Officials did not state whether any persons had been arrested or charged in their operation.<ref name=cushman />

An American official told ''[[MSNBC]]'' that the bomb was received by American security personnel in April, "was never near a plane" and "never posed a risk." They speculated that the bomb might have been constructed by [[Ibrahim al-Asiri]], who is accused of constructing the explosives used by [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] in 2009.<ref name="nbc">NBC News, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20120509071431/http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/05/07/11583173-cia-foiled-al-qaida-plot-to-destroy-us-bound-airliner?lite CIA foiled al-Qaida plot to destroy US-bound airliner], May 7, 2012.</ref>
