'''Antonis Samaras''' ({{lang-el|Αντώνης Σαμαράς}}, {{IPA-el|anˈdonis samaˈɾas|pron}}; born 23 May 1951) is a Greek politician who served as [[Prime Minister of Greece]] from 2012 to 2015. A member of the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party, he was its president from 2009 until 2015. Samaras started his national political career as [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Minister of Finance]] in 1989; he served as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1989 to 1992 (with a brief interruption in 1990) and [[Ministry of Culture and Sports (Greece)|Minister of Culture and Sports]] in 2009.

Samaras was previously best known for a 1993 controversy in which he effectively caused the New Democracy government, of which he was a member, to fall from power. In spite of this, he rejoined the party in 2004 and was elected to its leadership in a closely fought intra-party election in late 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=ND heads for tense election showdown |publisher=[[Kathimerini]] |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100006_28/11/2009_112865 |date=30 November 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2009 |archivedate=2 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202080529/http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100006_28/11/2009_112865 |url-status = live}}</ref> He was the seventh party leader since it was founded in 1974.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Athens]], Samaras is the son of Doctor Konstantinos Samaras (a Professor of [[Cardiology]]) and Lena (née Zannas, a maternal granddaughter of author [[Penelope Delta]]). His brother, Alexander, is an architect. His paternal uncle, George Samaras, was a long-standing Member of Parliament for [[Messinia]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

Samaras grew up among the Athens well-connected families, playing tennis. At the age of 17, he won the Greek Teen Tennis Championship.<ref>{{cite news| title=Profile: Greek conservative leader Antonis Samaras|author=Patrick Jackson|work=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18410765|date=20 June 2012}}</ref> He attended school in the [[Athens College]] (founded by his maternal great-grandfather, Stefanos Delta and [[Emmanouil Benakis]], Delta's father-in-law) and graduated from [[Amherst College]] in 1974 with a degree in [[economics]], and then from [[Harvard University]] in 1976 with an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]].

Samaras and former Prime Minister [[George Papandreou (junior)|George Papandreou]] were dormitory roommates during their student years at [[Amherst College]], but became bitter political rivals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_columns_1_04/12/2009_113043|title=As good as it gets|date=4 December 2009|publisher=ekathimerini|accessdate=8 December 2009}}</ref> He is married and has a daughter and a son.

==Political career==
===Early political involvement===

Samaras has been elected as a Member of Parliament, initially for [[Messinia]], from 1977 onward. In 1989 he became [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Minister of Finance]], later advancing to become the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] in the New Democracy government of Prime Minister [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]] (1990–1993), from which post he caused the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] to ignite. In a meeting of the Greek political leaders under the President of the Republic on the naming dispute on 13 April 1992, Samaras presented his own conditions for the solution of the crisis. These were rejected by both the President of the Republic, [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] as well as the Prime Minister, [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]]. Samaras was subsequently removed from Minister of Foreign Affairs.<ref>Eleutherotypia, 9 April 2005, [http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=110,dt=09.04.2005,id=29616224 "The 1992 Meeting and the Samaras dismissal"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109021328/http://archive.enet.gr/online/online_text/c=110,dt=09.04.2005,id=29616224 |date=9 November 2009 }} (in Greek)</ref>

===Foundation of Political Spring===
After being removed from his post, Samaras founded his own party, [[Political Spring]] (Greek: Πολιτική Άνοιξη, romanised as ''Politiki Anoixi''), located politically to the right of New Democracy.  The defection of one Member of Parliament from New Democracy to Samaras' party caused the government's fall from power in 1993.

Political Spring gained 4.9% of the vote in the [[1993 Greek legislative election|1993 general election]], earning ten seats in the [[Hellenic Parliament]]. They gained 8.7% in the elections in the [[1994 European Parliament election in Greece|1994 European Parliament elections]], earning two seats. Its decline started in the [[1996 Greek legislative election|1996 general election]], when it gained 2.94 per cent, just below the 3 per cent threshold necessary to enter parliament.  They participated in the [[1999 European Parliament election in Greece|1999 European Parliament elections]], but only got 2.3%, which was not enough to elect MEPs.

===Return to the New Democracy===
Political Spring did not participate in the [[2000 Greek legislative election|2000 general election]]; Samaras publicly supported the New Democracy party. Before the [[2004 Greek legislative election|2004 general election]], Samaras dissolved his party, rejoined New Democracy and he was elected a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) in the [[2004 European Parliament election in Greece|2004 European elections]].

In the [[2007 Greek legislative election|2007 general election]] he was elected to the Hellenic Parliament for [[Messinia]] and consequently resigned from the [[European Parliament]]. He was succeeded by [[Margaritis Schinas]]. In January 2009 he was appointed [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Minister of Culture]] following a government reshuffle. In this capacity he inaugurated the new [[Acropolis Museum]] in July 2009.  He was reelected in Messenia in 2009.

After New Democracy resoundingly lost the [[2009 Greek legislative election|2009 legislative election]], [[Kostas Karamanlis]] resigned as head of the party, prompting a leadership race, and Samaras ran for the post. Early polls showed he was running neck and neck with the perceived initial favorite [[Dora Bakoyanni]], the former Foreign Minister and former Athens mayor.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/37442/bakoyannis_holds_slim_lead_in_greeceaas_nd_race/ |title=Bakoyannis Holds Slim Lead in Greece's ND Race |publisher=Angus Reid |date=1 November 2009 |accessdate=6 November 2009 |archivedate=17 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617100737/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/37442/bakoyannis_holds_slim_lead_in_greeceaas_nd_race/ |url-status = dead}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, another leadership candidate, former Minister [[Dimitris Avramopoulos]] announced he was resigning his candidacy and would support Samaras instead. In a break with previous practice, an extraordinary party congress resolved that the new leader would be elected by party members in a countrywide ballot.  Samaras' candidacy soared in opinion polls and finished the race as a favorite.

===Leader of the Opposition===
[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - EPP Summit June 2010 (18).jpg|thumb|left|Antonis Samaras at a summit of the [[European People's Party]] in 2010]]
In the early morning hours of 30 November 2009, Samaras was elected the new President of New Democracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ametroepeia.pblogs.gr/files/f/474040-AntonVonSchamarAss.JPG|title=Antonis Samaras is the new ND leader|publisher=Mike Kamateros}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Following early results showing Samaras in a comfortable lead, Bakoyanni, his main rival, conceded defeat and called Samaras to congratulate him. He accepted his election with a speech at the party headquarters, and pledged to carry out a broad ideological and organizational reform, aspiring to regain majority status. He was later instrumental in the expulsion of Bakoyanni (2010) for defying the party line and voting for an austerity measure required for European Union-[[International Monetary Fund]] backed lending.

Prime Minister [[George Papandreou]] announced his government's plans on 31 October to hold a referendum on the acceptance of the terms of a [[Eurozone]] bailout deal. The referendum was to be held in December 2011 or January 2012. Following vehement opposition from both within and outside the country, Papandreou however scrapped the plan a few days later on 3 November.

On 5 November, his government only narrowly won a confidence vote in the Greek Parliament and Samaras called for immediate elections. The next day Papandreou met with opposition leaders trying to reach an agreement on the formation of an interim national unity government. However, Samaras only gave in, after Papandreou agreed to step aside, allowing the EU bailout to proceed and paving the way for elections on 19 February 2012.

After several days of intense negotiations, the two major parties along with the Popular Orthodox Rally agreed to form a grand coalition headed by former Vice President of the European Central Bank [[Lucas Papademos]]. On 10 November, George Papandreou formally resigned as Prime Minister of Greece. The new coalition cabinet and Prime Minister Lucas Papademos were formally sworn in on 11 November 2011.

Following the [[May 2012 Greek legislative election|May 2012 general election]] in which the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party became the largest party in the Hellenic Parliament, Samaras was asked by [[President of Greece|Greek President]] [[Karolos Papoulias]] to try to form a government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rthk.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/20120507/news_20120507_56_838693.htm|title=Samaras tries to form Greek coalition|publisher=Rthk.hk|accessdate=14 May 2012|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810231637/http://rthk.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/20120507/news_20120507_56_838693.htm|archivedate=10 August 2013}}</ref> However, after a day of negotiations with the other parties, Samaras officially announced he was giving up the mandate to form a government.

Voters once again took to the polls in the widely watched [[June 2012 Greek legislative election|June 2012 election]]. The New Democracy party came out on top in a stronger position with 129 seats, compared to 108 in the May election.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} On 20 June 2012, Samaras successfully formed a coalition with the PASOK (now led by former Finance Minister [[Evangelos Venizelos]]) and the [[Democratic Left (Greece)|Democratic Left]] (DIMAR).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-18524252|title=Antonis Samaras|accessdate=20 June 2012|work=BBC News|date=20 June 2012}}</ref> The new government had a majority of 28 (which was later reduced to 18),<ref>{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/11/08/uk-greece-defection-idUKBRE8A70E020121108|work=Reuters|title=Greek deputy quits ruling coalition party|date=8 November 2012}}</ref> with [[Syriza]], the [[Independent Greeks]] (ANEL), [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] (XA) and the [[Communist Party of Greece|Communist Party]] (KKE) comprising the opposition.

The Democratic Left left the coalition on 21 June 2013 in protest at the closure of the nation's public broadcaster [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation]] (ERT), leaving Samaras with a slim majority of 153 ND and PASOK MPs combined.<ref>{{cite news|title=Greece coalition partner pulls out ministers in wake of ERT debacle [update]|url=http://ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_21/06/2013_505319|accessdate=24 June 2013|newspaper=[[Kathimerini]]|date=24 June 2013|location=Piraeus}}</ref> The two remaining parties proceeded to negotiate a cabinet reshuffle that resulted in a significantly expanded role for PASOK in the new [[coalition government]].<ref>{{cite web|script-title=el:Η σύνθεση της νέας κυβέρνησης|url=http://ekprosopos.gov.gr/?p=4429|publisher=ΓΕΝΙΚΗ ΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΕΙΑ ΕΝΗΜΕΡΩΣΗΣ & ΕΠΙΚΟΙΝΩΝΙΑΣ - ΓΕΝΙΚΗ ΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΕΙΑ ΜΕΣΩΝ ΕΝΗΜΕΡΩΣΗΣ|accessdate=24 June 2013|location=Athens|language=Greek|date=24 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= New government is ushered in|url=http://ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_24/06/2013_505617|accessdate=24 June 2013|newspaper=Kathimerini|date=24 June 2013|location=Piraeus}}</ref> A further reshuffle followed the [[2014 European Parliament election in Greece|2014 European Parliament election]].<ref>{{cite news|script-title=el:Σαρωτικός ανασχηματισμός: Η σύνθεση της νέας κυβέρνησης - τα βιογραφικά|url=http://www.kathimerini.gr/770923/article/epikairothta/politikh/sarwtikos-o-anasxhmatismos---h-syn8esh-ths-neas-kyvernhshs-samara|accessdate=9 June 2014|work=Kathimerini|date=9 June 2014|language=Greek}}</ref>

Samaras implemented a series of reforms and [[austerity]] measures with the aim of reducing government budget deficits and making the Greek economy competitive. In 2013 he passed reform bills approving the layoff of 15,000 public employees, among them high school teachers, school guards and municipal policemen. At the same time, he cut value-added tax (VAT) in restaurants to 13 percent from 23 percent.<ref>{{cite news|title=Greece approves scheme to fire thousands of public workers|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/18/us-greece-vote-idUSBRE96G1AP20130718|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=25 July 2015|date=17 July 2013}}</ref> He also passed a bill instituting the Single Property Tax and the auction of houses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Auctions: The bill has passed|url=http://www.protothema.gr/news-in-english/article/338955/auctions-the-bill-has-passed/|publisher=Proto Thema|accessdate=4 January 2014}}</ref> The [[Ministry of Administrative Reform and e-Governance|Minister of Administrative Reform and e-Governance]] [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]] implemented an evaluation process on the public sector to locate surplus staff members.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evaluation and dismissal process expanded to wider public sector|url=http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=537988|publisher=tovima|accessdate=5 November 2013}}</ref>

On 9 December 2014, Samaras announced the candidacy of New Democracy politician [[Stavros Dimas]] for the position of [[President of Greece]]. Dimas failed to secure the required majority of MPs of the [[Hellenic Parliament]] in the first three rounds of voting. According to the provisions of the [[Constitution of Greece]], [[January 2015 Greek legislative election|snap elections]] were held on 25 January 2015, which were won by Syriza. Tsipras succeeded Samaras, who resigned as Leader of New Democracy on 5 July 2015, following the overwhelming victory of the "No" vote in the [[2015 Greek bailout referendum|bailout referendum]], naming [[Vangelis Meimarakis]] as transitional leader.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.in.gr/greece/article/?aid=1500010257 | script-title=el:Παραιτήθηκε ο Αντώνης Σαμαράς από την ηγεσία της Νέας Δημοκρατίας | date = 5 July 2015 | accessdate = 5 July 2015 | publisher = in.gr | language = Greek}}</ref> Samaras had been backing a "Yes" vote, together with his party, before the referendum.
