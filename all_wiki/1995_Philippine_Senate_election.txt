The '''1995 election of members to the Senate of the Philippines''' was the 25th election to the Senate of the Philippines. It was held on Monday, May 8, 1995 to elect 12 of the 24 seats in the Senate. Filipinos protected the ballot boxes with their lives and campaigned against [[traditional]] [[politicians]] who used [[bribe]]ry, flying voters, violence, election [[rigging]], stealing of ballot boxes, etc. The [[Philippine National Police]] (PNP) listed five people dead and listed more than 200 hotspots before and 300 hotspots during the election.

The two largest parties, [[Lakas–CMD (1991)|Lakas-NUCD]] and the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] (LDP), contested the senate election under the [[Lakas-Laban Coalition]] and won nine out of the 12 seats contested. The opposition-led coalition was composed of the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]] (NPC) which had an alliance with the [[People's Reform Party]] (PRP), though they contested the election separately.

This was also the first time that the electorate voted for twelve candidates under the [[plurality-at-large voting]] to the Senate; previously, the electorate voted for two candidates each per senatorial districts (1916–34), via closed party-lists (the "block voting" system in use from to 1941-49), and eight senators via [[plurality-at-large voting]] with the country as one "at-large" district from 1951 to 1971. This was also the first midterm election as the date the elected candidates take office falls at the midway point of President [[Fidel V. Ramos]]' six-year term.
