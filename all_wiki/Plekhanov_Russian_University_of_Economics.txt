'''Plekhanov Russian University of Economics''' ({{lang-ru|link=no| Российский экономический университет имени Г.В. Плеханова}}) is a public research university in Moscow. It was founded in 1907 by entrepreneur [[Aleksey Semyonovich Vishnyakov|Alexei Vishnyakov]] as the first finance-specialized college in the [[Russian Empire]]. During the Soviet rule it became a large university, recognized worldwide as one of the most prestigious.

Plekhanov Russian University of Economics is consistently ranked as one of the top 10 universities in Moscow, and is every year included in QS World University Rankings, as well as in top 200 worldwide by employability of the students after graduation.

In addition to accreditation by Ministry of Education, the university has accreditations of the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]], [[European Council for Business Education]] and [[Association of MBAs]]. PRUE is also a member of the [[European University Association]], [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] and the [[European Foundation for Management Development]].

PRUE changed its name more than once: Moscow Commercial Institute (1907–1919); Karl Marx Moscow Institute of the National Economy (1919–1924); Plekhanov Moscow Institute of the National Economy (1924–1991); the Plekhanov Russian Academy of Economics (1992–2010); Plekhanov Russian University of Economics (2010 to present). Recently, Plekhanov University acquired the Russian State University of Trade and Economics and the [[Moscow State University of Economics, Statistics, and Informatics]].

==History==
[[File:Moscow Plekhanov Russian Economic University 1 2011.JPG|left|thumb|The Memorial Building and Museum of PRUE on Stremyaniy Street 28]]
The Moscow Commercial Institute was founded in 1907 on private donations of merchants, bankers and manufacturers, gathered by initiative of the Moscow merchant [[Aleksey Semyonovich Vishnyakov|Alexei Vishnyakov]]. It was essentially the first institute in Russia which prepared qualified businessmen for rapidly developing branches of industry. Prior to the [[October Revolution of 1917|revolution of 1917]] about 2000 specialists were graduated from the institute. In 1924 it was renamed for [[Marxism|Marxist]] thinker [[Georgy Plekhanov]]. In the 1960s the Institute was merged with the Moscow Governmental Economic Institute and became one of the major centers of scientific education in the country. After 1991 the institute obtained its current name. Recent years were marked with rising international cooperation, such as the foundation of the Africa Business House. Now the university deals with more than 80 partners in 52 countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.rea.ru/portal/main.nsf/Sections/history|script-title=ru:Страницы истории|publisher=Plekhanov Russian Academy of Economics|language=Russian|trans-title=History|accessdate=19 August 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531194509/http://portal.rea.ru/portal/main.nsf/Sections/history|archivedate=31 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Among its graduates, there are many prominent politicians and businessmen, such as Soviet statesman [[Mikhail Suslov]], [[Liberal democracy|liberal democrat]] [[Grigory Yavlinsky]], and faculty member [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], former Chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR]] and later [[Chairman of the Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] (1991–1993).
