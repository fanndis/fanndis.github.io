==State taxes==
[[File:Gas Tax Jpeg.jpg|thumb|Gas tax by state, with border differences highlighted.]]The first US state tax on fuel was introduced on February 25, 1919 in [[Oregon]].<ref name=Oregon>Corning, Howard M. ''Dictionary of Oregon History''. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956.</ref> It was a 1¢/gal tax.<ref name="Oregon2">{{cite news |url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/commuting/2010/12/a_brief_history_of_oregon_vehi.html |title=A brief history of Oregon vehicle fees and fuel taxes |work=The Oregonian/Oregon Live |date=December 12, 2010}}</ref> In the following decade, all of the US states (48 at the time), along with the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], introduced a gasoline tax. By 1939, an average tax of 3.8¢/gal (1¢/L) of fuel was levied by the individual states.

In the years since being created, state fuel taxes have undergone many revisions.<ref name="varrate">{{cite journal |url=http://www.its.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/publications/UCB/99/WP/UCB-ITS-WP-99-3.pdf |last1=Ang-Olson |first1=Jeffrey |display-authors=etal |title=Variable-Rate State Gasoline Taxes |journal=Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California Berkeley |date=July 1999}}</ref> While most fuel taxes were initially levied as a fixed number of cents per gallon, {{as of|2016|lc=y}}, nineteen states and [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] have fuel taxes with rates that vary alongside changes in the price of fuel, the inflation rate, vehicle fuel-economy, or other factors.<ref name="varrate2">{{cite web |url=http://itep.org/itep_reports/2016/02/most-americans-live-in-states-with-variable-rate-gas-taxes-2.php |title=Most Americans Live in States with Variable-Rate Gas Taxes |work=Institute on Taxation Economic Policy |date=February 5, 2016}}</ref>

The table below includes state and local taxes and fees. The [[American Petroleum Institute]] uses a weighted average of local taxes by population of each municipality to come up with an average tax for the entire state. Similarly, the national average is weighted by volume of fuel sold in each state. Because many of the states with the highest taxes also have higher populations, more states have below average taxes than above average taxes.

Most states exempt gasoline from general sales taxes. However, several states do collect full or partial sales tax in addition to the excise tax. '''Sales tax is not reflected in the rates below.'''

The first federal gasoline tax in the United States was created on June 6, 1932, with the enactment of the [[Revenue Act of 1932]] with a tax of 1¢/gal (0.3¢/L). Since 1993, the US federal gasoline tax has been 18.4¢/gal (4.86¢/L). Unlike most other goods in the US, the price displayed includes all taxes, as opposed to inclusion at the point of purchase.

Then-[[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]] [[Mary Peters (politician)|Mary Peters]] stated on August 15, 2007, that about 60% of federal gas taxes are used for highway and bridge construction. The remaining 40% goes to earmarked programs.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929211337/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/transportation/july-dec07/infrastructure_08-15.html Online NewsHour: Conversation | Peters Discusses Infrastructure | August 15, 2007 | PBS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, revenues from other taxes are also used in federal [[transportation]] programs.

==Federal tax revenues==
Federal fuel taxes raised $36.4 billion in Fiscal Year 2016, with $26.1 billion raised from gasoline taxes and $10.3 billion raised from taxes on diesel and special motor fuels.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2016/fe10.cfm |title=Status of The Federal Highway Trust Fund |work=US Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration}}</ref>  The tax was last raised in 1993 and is not indexed to inflation. Total inflation from 1993 until 2017 was 68 percent.<ref>[https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=1&year1=199307&year2=201701 CPI Inflation Calculator]</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-major-federal-excise-taxes-and-how-much-money-do-they-raise |title = What are the major federal excise taxes, and how much money do they raise?}}</ref>

==Public policy==
Some policy advisors believe that an increased tax is needed to fund and sustain the country's transportation infrastructure.  As infrastructure construction costs have grown and vehicles have become more fuel efficient, the purchasing power of fixed-rate gas taxes has declined.<ref name="itepfedtax">{{cite web |url=http://www.itep.org/itep_reports/2013/09/a-federal-gas-tax-for-the-future.php |title=A Federal Gas Tax for the Future |work=Institute on Taxation Economic Policy |date=September 23, 2013}}</ref>  To offset this loss of purchasing power, The National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission issued a detailed report in February 2009 recommending a 10 cent increase in the gasoline tax, a 15 cent increase in the diesel tax, and a reform tying both tax rates to inflation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://financecommission.dot.gov/Documents/NSTIF_Commission_Final_Report_Exec_Summary_Feb09.pdf |title=Paying Our Way |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402213541/http://financecommission.dot.gov/Documents/NSTIF_Commission_Final_Report_Exec_Summary_Feb09.pdf |archivedate=2009-04-02}}</ref>

Critics of gas tax increases argue that much of the gas tax revenue is diverted to other government programs and debt servicing unrelated to transportation infrastructure.<ref>https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-siphon-gas-tax-for-other-uses-1405558382</ref>  But other researchers have noted that these diversions can occur in both directions, and that gas taxes and "user fees" paid by drivers are not high enough to cover the full cost of road-related spending.<ref name="taxfoundgastax">{{cite web |url=http://taxfoundation.org/article/gasoline-taxes-and-user-fees-pay-only-half-state-local-road-spending |title=Gasoline Taxes and User Fees Pay for Only Half of State & Local Road Spending |work=Tax Foundation |date=January 3, 2014}}</ref>

Some believe that an increased cost of fuel would also encourage less consumption and reduce America's dependence on foreign oil.  Americans sent nearly $430 billion to other countries in 2008 for the cost of imported oil.  However, due to increased domestic output (fracking of shale and other energy resource discoveries) as well as rapidly increasing production efficiencies, since 2008 this has already significantly reduced and expected to continue to fall.<ref>http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=15531</ref>

==Aviation fuel taxes==
'''Aviation gasoline (Avgas)''': The tax on aviation gasoline is $0.194 per gallon. When used in a fractional ownership program aircraft, gasoline also is subject to a surtax of $0.141 per gallon.

'''Kerosene for use in aviation (Jet fuel)''': Generally, kerosene is taxed at $0.244 per gallon unless a reduced rate applies.
For kerosene removed directly from a terminal into the fuel tank of an aircraft for use in non-commercial aviation, the tax rate is $0.219. The rate of $0.219 also applies if kerosene is removed into any aircraft from a qualified refueler truck, tanker, or tank wagon that is loaded with the kerosene from a terminal that is located within an airport. The airport terminal doesn't need to be a secured airport terminal for this rate to apply. However, the refueler truck, tanker, or tank wagon must meet the requirements discussed under certain refueler trucks, tankers, and tank wagons, treated as terminals, later.

These taxes mainly fund airport and Air Traffic Control operations by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA), of which commercial aviation is the biggest user.
