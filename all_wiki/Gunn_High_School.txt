'''Henry M. Gunn Senior High School''' is one of two public high schools in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[California]], along with its rival [[Palo Alto High School]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gunn.pausd.org|title=Henry M. Gunn High School|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>

Established in {{start date and age|1964|paren=y}}, Gunn High School was named after Henry Martin Gunn, who served as the Palo Alto superintendent from 1950 to 1961. In 1964, the [[Palo Alto Unified School District]] announced that it would name the district's third high school after him. The Class of 1966 was the first class to graduate from Gunn High School.<ref name="profile">{{cite web|url=http://gunn.pausd.org/home/web/files/profile07.pdf|title=2007 School Profile|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705114031/http://gunn.pausd.org/home/web/files/profile07.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-05|accessdate=2008-03-22}}</ref>

1,993 students attended the school in the 2019–2020 school year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gunn.pausd.org/sites/default/files/gunn.profile.2019-2020_oct.2019.pdf|title=School Profile 2019-2020|last=|first=|date=|website=Henry M.

[[Hanna Rosin]] wrote in a 2015 ''[[The Atlantic]]'' article that due to the emphasis on academics and competition between students, Gunn became "an extreme distillation of what parents in the meritocratic elite expect from a school." Around that time, families clamored to buy houses in Gunn's attendance boundary so their children could attend the school.<ref name=RosinHannaSuicide>{{cite magazine|author=Rosin, Hanna|authorlink=Hanna Rosin|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/12/the-silicon-valley-suicides/413140/|title=The Silicon Valley Suicides|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]|date=December 2015|accessdate=2018-08-31|quote=But in the e-mails traded among parents in the weeks after Cameron’s death, the obvious worry surfaced about whether all this emphasis on excellence imposed a cost on the kids[...]}}</ref> According to Rosin, after a spate of suicides of Gunn students in the 2010s, parents began to worry about whether the competitive atmosphere was harming students' mental well-being.<ref name="Rosinsuicides">{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/12/the-silicon-valley-suicides/413140/|title=The Suicide Clusters at Palo Alto High Schools - The Atlantic|author=Hanna Rosin|date=November 16, 2015|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=2016-01-18}}</ref>
