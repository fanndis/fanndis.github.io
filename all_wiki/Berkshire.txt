One of the [[home counties]], Berkshire was recognised by the Queen as the '''Royal County of Berkshire''' in 1957 because of the presence of [[Windsor Castle]], and [[letters patent]] were issued in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|title="The Royal County of Berkshire".

The county town is [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]].

The [[River Thames]] formed the historic northern boundary, from [[Buscot]] in the west to [[Old Windsor]] in the east.  The historic county therefore includes territory that is now administered by the [[Vale of White Horse]] and parts of [[South Oxfordshire]] in [[Oxfordshire]], but excludes [[Caversham, Reading|Caversham]], [[Slough]] and five less populous settlements in the east of the [[Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead]].  All the changes mentioned, apart from the change to Caversham, took place in 1974.

Much of the early history of the county is recorded in the ''Chronicles'' of the [[Abingdon Abbey]], which at the time of the survey was second only to the crown in the extent and number of its possessions, such as [[The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay]]. The abbot also exercised considerable judicial and administrative powers, and his court was endowed with the privileges of the hundred court and was freed from liability to interference by the sheriff. Berkshire and Oxfordshire had a common sheriff until the reign of Elizabeth, and the shire court was held at Grauntpont. The assizes were formerly held at Reading, Abingdon, and Newbury, but by 1911 were held entirely at Reading.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=783–784}}

Berkshire has been the scene of some notable battles throughout its history. [[Alfred the Great]]'s campaign against the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] included the Battles of [[Englefield, Berkshire|Englefield]], [[Battle of Ashdown|Ashdown]] and [[Battle of Reading (871)|Reading]]. [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] was the site of two [[English Civil War]] battles: the [[First Battle of Newbury]] (at [[Wash Common]]) in 1643 and the [[Second Battle of Newbury]] (at [[Speen, Berkshire|Speen]]) in 1644. The nearby [[Donnington Castle]] was reduced to a ruin in the aftermath of the second battle. Another [[Battle of Reading (1688)|Battle of Reading]] took place on 9 December 1688. It was the only substantial military action in England during the [[Glorious Revolution]] and ended in a decisive victory for forces loyal to [[William III of England|William of Orange]].<ref>{{citation|last=Daniell|first=Christopher|year=2014|title= Atlas of Early Modern Britain, 1485–1715}}</ref>

[[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] became the new county town in 1867, taking over from [[Abingdon, Berkshire|Abingdon]], which remained in the county. Under the [[Local Government Act 1888]], Berkshire County Council took over functions of the Berkshire [[Quarter Sessions]], covering the administrative county of Berkshire, which excluded the [[county borough]] of [[Borough of Reading|Reading]]. Boundary alterations in the early part of the 20th century were minor, with Caversham from [[Oxfordshire]] becoming part of the Reading county borough and cessions in the [[Oxford]] area.

On 1 April 1974, Berkshire's boundaries changed under the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Berkshire took over administration of [[Slough]] and [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] and part of the former [[Eton Rural District]] from Buckinghamshire.<ref name=guide/> The northern part of the county became part of [[Oxfordshire]], with [[Faringdon]], [[Wantage]] and [[Abingdon, Berkshire|Abingdon]] and their hinterland becoming the [[Vale of White Horse]] district, and [[Didcot]] and [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] added to [[South Oxfordshire]] district.<ref name=guide/> [[Berkshire Yeomanry|94 (Berkshire Yeomanry) Signal Squadron]] still keep the [[Uffington White Horse]] in their insignia, even though the White Horse is now in Oxfordshire. The original Local Government White Paper would have transferred [[Henley-on-Thames]] from Oxfordshire to Berkshire: this proposal did not make it into the Bill as introduced.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

On 1 April 1998 Berkshire County Council was abolished under a recommendation of the [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|Banham Commission]], and the districts became [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]]. Unlike similar reforms elsewhere at the same time, the non-metropolitan county was not abolished.<ref name=1996order>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1996/Uksi_19961879_en_2.htm |title=The Berkshire (Structural Change) Order 1996 |date=18 July 1996 |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=20 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209084421/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1996/Uksi_19961879_en_2.htm |archive-date=9 December 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199495/cmhansrd/1995-03-31/Writtens-2.html |title=Written Answers to Questions Col.830 |date=31 March 1995 |work=House of Commons Hansard Debates |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] |accessdate=20 April 2010 |quote=In Berkshire, although the county council will be abolished, the county area will remain.

All of the county is drained by the Thames. Berkshire divides into two topological (and associated geological) sections: east and west of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. North-east Berkshire has the low calciferous (limestone) m-shaped bends of the Thames south of which is a broader, clayey, gravelly former watery plain or belt from Earley to Windsor and beyond, south, are parcels and belts of uneroded higher sands, flints, shingles and lightly acid soil and in the north of the [[Bagshot Formation]], north of [[Surrey]] and [[Hampshire]].  [[Swinley Forest]] also known as Bracknell Forest, [[Windsor Great Park]], Crowthorne and Stratfield Saye Woods have many pine, silver birch, and other lightly acid-soil trees.  East of the grassy and wooded bends a large minority of East Berkshire's land mirrors the clay belt being of low elevation and on the left ('north') bank of the [[River Thames|Thames]]: Slough, Eton, Eton Wick, Wraysbury, Horton, and Datchet. In the heart of the county Reading's northern suburb Caversham is also on that bank but rises steeply into the [[Chiltern Hills]].

Two main tributaries skirt past Reading, the [[River Loddon|Loddon]] and its sub-tributary the [[River Blackwater (River Loddon)|Blackwater]] draining parts of two counties south and the Kennet draining part of upland Wiltshire in the west. Heading west the reduced, but equally large, part of county becomes ever further from the Thames which flows from the north-north-west before the [[Goring Gap]]; West Berkshire hosts the varying-width plain of the [[River Kennet]] rising to high chalk hills by way of and lower clay slopes and rises. To the south, the land crests along the boundary with [[Hampshire]]; the highest parts of South-East and Eastern England taken together are here. The highest is [[Walbury Hill]] at 297&nbsp;m (974&nbsp;ft). To the north of the Kennet are the [[Berkshire Downs]]. This is hilly country, with smaller and well-wooded valleys those of the [[River Lambourn|Lambourn]], [[River Pang|Pang]], and their Thames sub-tributaries. The open upland areas vie with [[Newmarket, Suffolk]] for [[horse racing]] training and breeding centres and have good fields of barley, wheat, and other cereal crops.

According to 2003 estimates there were 803,657 people in Berkshire, or 636 people/km<sup>2</sup>. The population is mostly based in the urban areas to the east and centre of the county: the largest towns here are [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Slough]], [[Bracknell]], [[Maidenhead]], [[Woodley, Berkshire|Woodley]], [[Wokingham]], [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], [[Earley]], [[Sandhurst, Berkshire|Sandhurst]], and [[Crowthorne]]. West Berkshire is much more rural and sparsely populated, with far fewer towns: the largest are [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[Thatcham]], and [[Hungerford]].

In 1831, there were 146,234 people living in Berkshire; by 1901 the population had risen to 252,571 (of whom 122,807 were male and 129,764 were female). Below are the largest immigrant groups in 2011.

==Governance==
{{Main|Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire|High Sheriff of Berkshire| counties of England}}

Berkshire, as a [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] and [[non-metropolitan county]], is one of four currently in England in that it has no council covering its entire area; rather it is divided into unitary authorities. [[Berkshire County Council]] existed from 1889 to its 1998 abolition. Of the other English non-metropolitan counties, at present [[Bedfordshire]], [[Cheshire]] and [[County Durham]] function in the same manner, although one of the unitary authorities within the latter has taken to itself the name Durham County Council, rather than the name "The Durham Council" that legislation also offered it. The ceremonial county has a [[Lord Lieutenant]] and a [[High Sheriff]]. The [[Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire]] is James Puxley, and the [[High Sheriff of Berkshire]] for 2018/19 is Graham Barker.
