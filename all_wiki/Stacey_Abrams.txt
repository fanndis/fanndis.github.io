Abrams also worked with Deal on criminal-justice reforms that reduced prison costs without increasing crime,<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=http://time.com/5349541/stacey-abrams-georgia/|title=Stacey Abrams Could Become America's First Black Female Governor{{snd}}If She Can Turn Georgia Blue|website=Time|language=en|access-date=July 30, 2018|archive-date=July 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729081919/http://time.com/5349541/stacey-abrams-georgia/|url-status=live}}</ref> and with Republicans on the state's biggest-ever public transportation funding package.<ref name=":0" />

Almost a week before election day, the Republican nominee, Georgia Secretary of State [[Brian Kemp]], canceled a debate scheduled seven weeks earlier in order to attend a [[Donald Trump|Trump]] rally. Kemp blamed Abrams for the cancellation, saying she was unwilling to reschedule it. Abrams responded, “We refuse to callously take Georgians for granted and cancel on them.
