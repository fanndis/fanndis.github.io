==History==
[[File:Brooklyn Friends School - Brooklyn, NY - DSC07693.JPG|thumb|right|Brooklyn Law School at 375 Pearl Street (now [[Brooklyn Friends School]])]]
The origins of Brooklyn Law School can be traced back to the [[Pratt Institute]] in [[Clinton Hill, Brooklyn]], when in the 1890s the school established its Department of Commerce.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scup.org/asset/52919/45073%20Pratt%20MP%20Report-Part%201-Composited.pdf |title=Pratt Historic Preservation Master Plan |publisher=scup.org |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192319/http://www.scup.org/asset/52919/45073%20Pratt%20MP%20Report-Part%201-Composited.pdf |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Because of its overwhelming popularity, the Department of Commerce broke off from the main Institute and formed its own school, under the guidance of Norman P. Heffley, personal secretary to [[Charles Pratt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brownstoner.com/blog/2011/08/draftbuilding-of-the-day-375-pearl-street/ |title=Building of the Day: 375 Pearl Street |work=Brownstoner |date=October 3, 2013 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aRRSAAAAYAAJ&q=Heffley+School+of+Commerce&pg=PA2 |title=Norman P. Heffley |publisher=Shorthand Educator |accessdate=October 9, 2013|year=1898 }}</ref> The Heffley School of Commerce, formed from Pratt's Department of Commerce, originally shared facilities with Pratt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brownstoner.com/blog/2010/09/walkabout-steno/ |title=Walkabout: Stenography and the Law in Brooklyn |work=Brownstoner |date=October 3, 2013 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref>

In 1901, [[William P. Richardson (law school dean)|William Payson Richardson]] and Norman P. Heffley reorganized the Heffley School to become Brooklyn Law School, the first law school on [[Long Island]].<ref name="nytimes">{{cite book |title=Brooklyn Law School: the first hundred years |last=Morris |first=Jeffrey Brandon |year=2001 |publisher=Brooklyn Law School |location=Brooklyn, NY |isbn=978-0-9712953-0-8 |page=232 |url=http://brkl.brooklaw.edu/record=b181660~S0 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120630205711/http://brkl.brooklaw.edu/record=b181660~S0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 30, 2012 |accessdate=March 22, 2011 }}</ref> Using space provided by Heffley's business school, the law school opened on September 30, 1901, with five faculty members (including Richardson as dean and Heffley as president), and two special lecturers.

The year began with five students, and ended with 28.<ref name="nytimes" /> In late 1901, the [[Board of Regents]] of the State of New York granted a charter to the law school. The law school became fully accredited by the [[American Bar Association]] through the Council of its Section on Legal Education and Admission to the Bar, and is a member of the [[Association of American Law Schools]]. The law school's curriculum is registered with and approved by the [[New York State Education Department]].<ref name="nytimes" />

From its earliest days, Brooklyn Law School opened its door to minorities, women, and immigrants, and it offered night classes for those with full-time jobs. Dean Richardson also allowed students who had difficulty paying tuition to remain enrolled on credit. The school moved twice between 1901 and 1928, when it finally moved into the first building designed and built specifically for it at 375 Pearl Street in downtown Brooklyn. Though the school lacked a campus, dormitories, and a cafeteria, students could engage in a wide range of extracurricular activities.

[[World War II]] struck Brooklyn Law School especially hard, and by 1943 enrollment was down to 174 students. [[St. Lawrence University]], which until then operated Brooklyn Law School and conferred its degrees, decided to shut down the school. Prominent alumni were galvanized into action, and negotiated the repurchase of the school's assets, ensuring that Brooklyn Law School would operate as an independent institution.<ref name="nytimes" />

Brooklyn Law School's faculty includes 60 full-time professors, 15 emeriti faculty, and a number of adjunct faculty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brooklaw.edu/faculty/directory/fulltime|title=Faculty.|publisher=Brooklaw.edu|accessdate=June 1, 2011}}</ref> The law school draws on a large body of practitioners, public officials, and judges as adjunct faculty to teach specialized courses in many areas of law, including international sales law, [[securities law]], [[real estate development]], [[trial advocacy]], business crimes, corporate litigation, [[sports law]], and border and homeland security law.

==Journals and competitions==

===Journals===
The law school publishes four student-edited law journals: the ''Brooklyn Law Review'', ''Brooklyn Journal of International Law,'' the ''Journal of Law and Policy'', and the ''Brooklyn Journal of Corporate, Financial, and Commercial Law''. Over 290 second and third-year students have the opportunity to write for one of the journals.<ref>"{{cite web
 | title =Law Journals

 | accessdate =March 24, 2011}}"
</ref>

All four student journals select new members based on writing ability and academic achievement. Each journal selects members by membership competition submissions and grades received during the first year of law school. Each journal requires that its members be in the top 75% of their class.

===Moot Court===
The law school has both trial and appellate advocacy [[moot court]] divisions. Each year it enters approximately 30 teams in national moot court competitions. These competitions span all areas of the law, including family law, criminal procedure, [[white-collar crime]], and [[international law]].

In 2011, Brooklyn Law School took home top international, national, and regional titles. Its teams won first place in the Irving R. Kaufman Memorial Moot Court Competition, and were first place Champions in the Domenick L. Gabrielli National Family Law Competition.

[[File:BLSboerum.JPG|thumb|left|Brooklyn Law School's administrative building located at One Boerum Place, near the [[Fulton Mall]]]]
In 2009, Brooklyn Law School clinical program was ranked 28th in the nation. In 2010, The National Jurist ranked BLS fourth in the country for its public service work, largely influenced by its clinical program.

Students represent individual clients, groups, and businesses and appear in state, federal, and administrative courts, on both the trial and appellate levels. Brooklyn Law School created a new mandate in 2014 that requires students to complete at least one clinic or externship course before graduation. Among the law school's clinics include:
* The Advocates for Adults With Intellectual and Developmental Disability (AAIDD) Clinic<ref>{{cite web|title=Brooklyn Law School Announces $1 Million Grant for Innovative Legal Clinic Serving Adults with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities|url=http://www.brooklaw.edu/newsandevents/news/2014/10-14-2014a.aspx?|website=www.brooklaw.edu|accessdate=14 October 2014}}</ref> represents low-income New Yorkers and their families in a variety of civil matters that impact adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and provides the opportunity for students to advocate in diverse areas of law ranging from public benefits, guardianship, housing and access to government services.

Courses in international business law and comparative topics are taught by faculty from American and European law schools.

====Semester abroad====
* Exchange Program with Bucerius Law School in Hamburg, Germany
Each year, the law school selects two students to attend [[Bucerius Law School]] during the fall semester while two Bucerius students study at Brooklyn Law School.
