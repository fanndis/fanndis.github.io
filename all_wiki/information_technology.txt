'''Information technology''' ('''IT''') is the use of [[computer]]s to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate [[Data (computing)|data]]<ref name="DOP">{{citation |contribution=IT |title=A Dictionary of Physics |editor-last=Daintith |editor-first=John |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t83.e1592 |access-date=1 August 2012|isbn=9780199233991 }} {{subscription required}}</ref> or [[information]]. IT is typically used within the context of [[business operations]] as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foldoc.org/information+technology|title=Free on-line dictionary of computing (FOLDOC)|access-date=9 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415234011/http://foldoc.org/Information+Technology|archive-date=15 April 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> IT is considered to be a subset of [[information and communications technology]] (ICT). An '''information technology system''' ('''IT system''') is generally an [[information system]], a [[communications system]] or, more specifically speaking, a [[Computer|computer system]] – including all [[Computer hardware|hardware]], [[software]] and [[peripheral]] equipment – operated by a limited group of users.

Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the [[Sumer]]ians in [[Mesopotamia]] developed [[Cuneiform|writing]] in about 3000&nbsp;BC,<ref name="Butler">{{citation |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G. |title=A History of Information Technology and Systems |url=http://www.tcf.ua.edu/AZ/ITHistoryOutline.htm |publisher=University of Arizona |access-date=2 August 2012}}</ref> but the term ''information technology'' in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]''; authors [[Harold Leavitt|Harold J. Leavitt]] and Thomas L. Whisler commented that "the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT)." Their definition consists of three categories: techniques for processing, the application of [[Statistics|statistical]] and mathematical methods to [[decision-making]], and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.<ref name="LeavittWhisler">{{citation |title=Management in the 1980s |url=http://hbr.org/1958/11/management-in-the-1980s |last1=Leavitt |first1=Harold J. |last2=Whisler |first2=Thomas L. |journal=Harvard Business Review |year=1958 |volume=11}}</ref>

The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as [[television]] and telephones. Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including [[computer hardware]], software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, [[Telecommunications equipment|telecom equipment]], and [[e-commerce]].<ref name="DMC">{{citation |last1=Chandler |first1=Daniel |last2=Munday |first2=Rod |contribution=Information technology |title=A Dictionary of Media and Communication |edition=first |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nLuJz-ZB828C&pg=PA211 |quote = Commonly a synonym for computers and computer networks but more broadly designating any technology that is used to generate, store, process, and/or distribute information electronically, including television and telephone. |access-date=1 August 2012 |url-access=subscription |isbn=978-0199568758 |date=2011-02-10 }}</ref>{{efn|On the later more broad application of the term IT, Keary comments: "In its original application 'information technology' was appropriate to describe the convergence of technologies with application in the vast field of data storage, retrieval, processing, and dissemination. This useful conceptual term has since been converted to what purports to be of great  use, but without the reinforcement of definition&nbsp;... the term IT lacks substance when applied to the name of any function, discipline, or position."{{sfnp|Ralston|Hemmendinger|Reilly|2000|p=869|ps=none}}}}

Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development: pre-mechanical (3000&nbsp;BC&nbsp;– 1450&nbsp;AD), mechanical (1450–1840), [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] (1840–1940), and electronic (1940–present).<ref name="Butler"/> This article focuses on the most recent period (electronic).

{{main|History of computing hardware}}

[[Machine|Devices]] have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, probably initially in the form of a [[tally stick]].<ref name="Schmandt-Besserat">{{citation |last=Schmandt-Besserat |first=Denise |title=Decipherment of the earliest tablets |journal=Science |year=1981 |volume=211 |issue=4479 |pages=283–85 |doi=10.1126/science.211.4479.283 |pmid=17748027 |bibcode=1981Sci...211..283S }}</ref> The [[Antikythera mechanism]], dating from about the beginning of the first century BC, is generally considered to be the earliest known mechanical [[analog computer]], and the earliest known geared mechanism.{{sfnp|Wright|2012|p=279|ps=none}} Comparable geared devices did not emerge in Europe until the 16th century, and it was not until 1645 that the first [[mechanical calculator]] capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed.{{sfnp|Chaudhuri|2004|p=3|ps=none}}

[[Electronic computers]], using either [[relay]]s or [[valve]]s, began to appear in the early 1940s. The [[electromechanical]] [[Z3 (computer)|Zuse Z3]], completed in 1941, was the world's first [[computer programming|programmable]] computer, and by modern standards one of the first machines that could be considered a complete [[computing]] machine. [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], developed during the Second World War to decrypt [[Nazi Germany|German]] messages, was the first [[electronics|electronic]] [[Digital data|digital]] computer. Although it was [[Computer programming|programmable]], it was not general-purpose, being designed to perform only a single task. It also lacked the ability to store its program in memory; programming was carried out using plugs and switches to alter the internal wiring.{{sfnp|Lavington|1980|p=11|ps=none}} The first recognisably modern electronic digital [[stored-program computer]] was the [[Manchester Baby]], which ran its first program on 21 June 1948.<ref name="Enticknap">{{citation |last=Enticknap |first=Nicholas |title=Computing's Golden Jubilee |journal=Resurrection |issue=20 |date=Summer 1998 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res20.htm#d |issn=0958-7403 |access-date=19 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109142655/http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res20.htm#d |archive-date=9 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The development of [[transistor]]s in the late 1940s at [[Bell Laboratories]] allowed a new generation of computers to be designed with greatly reduced power consumption. The first commercially available stored-program computer, the [[Ferranti Mark I]], contained 4050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. By comparison, the first transistorized computer developed at the University of Manchester and operational by November 1953, consumed only 150 watts in its final version.<ref>{{citation |doi=10.1049/esej:19980301 |last=Cooke-Yarborough |first=E.

Several later breakthroughs in [[semiconductor]] technology include the [[integrated circuit]] (IC) invented by [[Jack Kilby]] at [[Texas Instruments]] and [[Robert Noyce]] at [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] in 1959, the [[metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET) invented by [[Mohamed Atalla]] and [[Dawon Kahng]] at Bell Laboratories in 1959, and the [[microprocessor]] invented by [[Ted Hoff]], [[Federico Faggin]], [[Masatoshi Shima]] and [[Stanley Mazor]] at [[Intel]] in 1971. These important inventions led to the development of the [[personal computer]] (PC) in the 1970s, and the emergence of [[information and communications technology]] (ICT).<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced information on the Nobel Prize in Physics 2000 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/advanced-physicsprize2000.pdf |website=[[Nobel Prize]] |date=June 2018 |accessdate=December 17, 2019}}</ref>

Early electronic computers such as [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] made use of [[punched tape]], a long strip of paper on which data was represented by a series of holes, a technology now obsolete.{{sfnp|Alavudeen|Venkateshwaran|2010|p=178|ps=none}} Electronic data storage, which is used in modern computers, dates from World War II, when a form of [[delay line memory]] was developed to remove the clutter from [[radar]] signals, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line.{{sfnp|Lavington|1998|p=1|ps=none}} The first [[random-access memory|random-access]] digital storage device was the [[Williams tube]], based on a standard [[cathode ray tube]],<ref name="Resurrection">{{citation |title=Early computers at Manchester University |journal=Resurrection |volume=1 |issue=4 |date=Summer 1992 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res04.htm#g |issn=0958-7403 |accessdate=19 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828010743/http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res04.htm#g |archive-date=28 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> but the information stored in it and delay line memory was volatile in that it had to be continuously refreshed, and thus was lost once power was removed.

====Databases====
{{main|Database}}

Database Management Systems (DMS) emerged in the 1960s to address the problem of storing and retrieving large amounts of data accurately and quickly. An early such systems was [[IBM]]'s [[IBM Information Management System|Information Management System]] (IMS),{{sfnp|Ward|Dafoulas|2006|p=2|ps=none}} which is still widely deployed more than 50 years later.<ref name="IMS">{{citation |last=Olofson |first=Carl W. |title=A Platform for Enterprise Data Services |date=October 2009 |publisher=[[International Data Corporation|IDC]] |url=http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/data/sw-library/ims/idc-power-of-ims.pdf |access-date=7 August 2012}}</ref> IMS stores data [[Hierarchical database model|hierarchically]],{{sfnp|Ward|Dafoulas|2006|p=2|ps=none}} but in the 1970s [[Edgar F. Codd|Ted Codd]] proposed an alternative relational storage model based on [[set theory]] and [[predicate logic]] and the familiar concepts of tables, rows and columns. In 1981, the first commercially available [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS) was released by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]].{{sfnp|Ward|Dafoulas|2006|p=3|ps=none}}

All DMS consist of components, they allow the data they store to be accessed simultaneously by many users while maintaining its integrity.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BcOUCgAAQBAJ|title=Database System Concepts|last=Silberschatz|first=Abraham|date=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|isbn=978-0-07-741800-7|language=en}}</ref> All databases are common in one point that the structure of the data they contain is defined and stored separately from the data itself, in a [[database schema]].{{sfnp|Ward|Dafoulas|2006|p=2|ps=none}}

In recent years, the [[XML|extensible markup language]] (XML) has become a popular format for data representation. Although XML data can be stored in normal [[file system]]s, it is commonly held in [[relational database]]s to take advantage of their "robust implementation verified by years of both theoretical and practical effort".{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=2|ps=none}} As an evolution of the [[Standard Generalized Markup Language]] (SGML), XML's text-based structure offers the advantage of being both machine and human-readable.{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=4|ps=none}}

===Data retrieval===
The relational database model introduced a programming-language independent [[SQL|Structured Query Language]] (SQL), based on [[relational algebra]].

The terms "data" and "information" are not synonymous. Anything stored is data, but it only becomes information when it is organized and presented meaningfully.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kedar |first1=Seema |title=Database Management System |date=2009 |publisher=Technical Publications |isbn=9788184316049 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SELyJ4a5nTcC |language=en}}</ref>{{rp|1–9}} Most of the world's digital data is unstructured, and stored in a variety of different physical formats{{sfnp|van der Aalst|2011|p=2|ps=none}}{{efn|name=format|"Format" refers to the physical characteristics of the stored data such as its [[character encoding|encoding]] scheme; "structure" describes the organisation of that data.}} even within a single organization. [[Data warehouse]]s began to be developed in the 1980s to integrate these disparate stores. They typically contain data extracted from various sources, including external sources such as the Internet, organized in such a way as to facilitate [[decision support system]]s (DSS).<ref>{{citation |last=Dyché |first=Jill |title=Turning Data Into Information With Data Warehousing |year=2000 |publisher=Addison Wesley |isbn=978-0-201-65780-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/edataturningdata00dych }}</ref>{{rp|4–6}}

===Data transmission===
[[Data transmission]] has three aspects: transmission, propagation, and reception.{{sfnp|Weik|2000|p=361|ps=none}} It can be broadly categorized as [[broadcasting]], in which information is transmitted unidirectionally downstream, or [[telecommunications]], with bidirectional upstream and downstream channels.{{r|HilbertLopez2011}}

XML has been increasingly employed as a means of data interchange since the early 2000s,{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=xiii|ps=none}} particularly for machine-oriented interactions such as those involved in web-oriented [[communications protocol|protocols]] such as [[SOAP]],{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=4|ps=none}} describing "data-in-transit rather than&nbsp;... data-at-rest".{{sfnp|Pardede|2009|p=xiii|ps=none}}

===Data manipulation===
Hilbert and Lopez identify the exponential pace of technological change (a kind of [[Moore's law]]): machines' application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months between 1986 and 2007; the per capita capacity of the world's general-purpose computers doubled every 18 months during the same two decades; the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months; the world's storage capacity per capita required roughly 40 months to double (every 3 years); and per capita broadcast information has doubled every 12.3 years.{{r|HilbertLopez2011}}

Massive amounts of data are stored worldwide every day, but unless it can be analysed and presented effectively it essentially resides in what have been called data tombs: "data archives that are seldom visited".{{sfnp|Han|Kamber|Pei|2011|p=5|ps=none}} To address that issue, the field of [[data mining]]&nbsp;– "the process of discovering interesting patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data"{{sfnp|Han|Kamber|Pei|2011|p=8|ps=none}}&nbsp;– emerged in the late 1980s.{{sfnp|Han|Kamber|Pei|2011|p=xxiii|ps=none}}

==Perspectives==

===Academic perspective===
In an academic context, the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] defines IT as "undergraduate degree programs that prepare students to meet the computer technology needs of business, government, healthcare, schools, and other kinds of organizations&nbsp;.... IT specialists assume responsibility for selecting hardware and software products appropriate for an organization, integrating those products with organizational needs and infrastructure, and installing, customizing, and maintaining those applications for the organization’s computer users."<ref name="curricula">The Joint Task Force for Computing Curricula 2005.[http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report (pdf)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021153204/http://www.acm.org/education/curric_vols/CC2005-March06Final.pdf |date=21 October 2014 }}</ref>

===Commercial and employment perspective===
Companies in the information technology field are often discussed as a group as the "tech sector" or the "tech industry".<ref>{{cite news|title=Technology Sector Snapshot|url=http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/markets/usmarkets/sectors.asp?sector=57|accessdate=12 January 2017|work=New York Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113163914/http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/markets/usmarkets/sectors.asp?sector=57|archive-date=13 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Our programmes, campaigns and partnerships |url=https://www.techuk.org/focus|publisher=TechUK |access-date=12 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cyberstates 2016|url=https://www.comptia.org/resources/cyberstates-2016|publisher=CompTIA|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>

Many companies now have IT departments for managing the computers, networks, and other technical areas of their businesses.

In a business context, the [[Information Technology Association of America]] has defined information technology as "the study, design, development, application, implementation, support or management of computer-based information systems".<ref>{{citation |last=Proctor |first=K. Scott |title=Optimizing and Assessing Information Technology: Improving Business Project Execution |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-118-10263-3}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2017}} The responsibilities of those working in the field include network administration, software development and installation, and the planning and management of an organization's technology life cycle, by which hardware and software are maintained, upgraded and replaced.
