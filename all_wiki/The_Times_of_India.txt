==History==
[[File:TimesOf Buildings.jpg|thumb|left|Times of India Buildings, ca. 1898]]

===Beginnings===
[[File:Machinemen, pressmen and sepoys, in The Times of India office in Bombay, November 1898.jpg|thumb|[[Diamond jubilee|Diamond Jubilee]], November 1898.]]
''The Times of India'' issued its first edition on 3 November 1838 as '''''The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce'''''.<ref name=Britannica>{{cite encyclopedia| title=The Times of India| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/596251/The-Times-of-India| encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica| date=15 April 2013| accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref><ref name="televisionpoint2006">{{cite web| url=http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2006/newsfullstory.php?id=1146042260| title=''The Times of India'' turns the Times of Colour| publisher=Televisionpoint.com| date=30 April 2006| accessdate=16 October 2007| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012225524/http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2006/newsfullstory.php?id=1146042260| archive-date=12 October 2007| df=dmy-all}}</ref> The paper was published on Wednesdays and Saturdays under the direction of Raobahadur Narayan Dinanath Velkar, a Maharashtrian [[List of Marathi social reformers|social reformer]], and contained news from Britain and the world, as well as the [[Indian Subcontinent]]. J.E. Brennan was its first editor.<ref name="Parhi2008">{{cite book|author=Asima Ranjan Parhi|title=Indian English Through Newspapers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-pPLnk1RyHEC&pg=PA32|year=2008|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-8069-507-0|pages=32–}}</ref><ref name="Parthasarathy1989">{{cite book|author=Rangaswami Parthasarathy|title=Journalism in India: from the earliest times to the present day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_5kAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 June 2016|year=1989|publisher=Sterling Publishers|page=273}}</ref> In 1850, it began to publish daily editions.

In 1860, editor [[Robert Knight (editor)|Robert Knight]] (1825–1892) bought the Indian shareholders' interests, merged with rival ''Bombay Standard'', and started India's first news agency. It wired ''Times'' dispatches to papers across the country and became the Indian agent for [[Reuters]] news service. In 1861, he changed the name from the Bombay ''Times and Standard'' to ''The Times of India.'' Knight fought for a press free of prior restraint or intimidation, frequently resisting the attempts by governments, business interests, and cultural spokesmen and led the paper to national prominence.<ref>{{cite book| first=Edwin| last=Hirschmann| title=Robert Knight: Reforming Editor in Victorian India| publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2008| isbn=978-0-19-569622-6}}</ref><ref name="Lalvani2016">{{cite book|author=Kartar Lalvani|title=The Making of India: The Untold Story of British Enterprise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4SlCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA383|accessdate=26 June 2016|date=10 March 2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4729-2484-1|pages=383–}}</ref> In the 19th century, this newspaper company employed more than 800 people and had a sizeable circulation in India and Europe. This was just the start of a historic journey.

===Bennett and Coleman ownership===
Subsequently, ''The Times of India'' saw its ownership change several times until 1892 when an English journalist named Thomas Jewell Bennett along with Frank Morris Coleman (who later drowned in the 1915 sinking of the [[SS Persia (1900)|SS ''Persia'']]) acquired the newspaper through their new joint stock company, ''Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd''.

===Dalmia ownership===
Sir [[Stanley Reed (British politician)|Stanley Reed]] edited ''The Times of India'' from 1907 until 1924 and received correspondence from the major figures of India such as [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. In all he lived in India for fifty years. He was respected in the United Kingdom as an expert on Indian current affairs. He christened [[Jaipur]] as "the Pink City of India".

[[The Times Group|Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd]] was sold to sugar magnate Ramkrishna Dalmia of the then-famous industrial family, the Dalmias, for {{INRConvert|20|m|year=1946}} in 1946, as India was becoming independent and the British owners were leaving.<ref name="Kasbekar2006">{{cite book|author=Asha Kasbekar|title=Pop Culture India!: Media, Arts, and Lifestyle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sv7Uk0UcdM8C&pg=PA112|accessdate=27 June 2016|date=January 2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-636-7|pages=112–}}</ref> In 1955 the [[Vivian Bose]] Commission of Inquiry found that Ramkrishna Dalmia, in 1947, had engineered the acquisition of the media giant [[The Times Group|Bennett Coleman & Co.]] by transferring money from a bank and an insurance company of which he was the Chairman.
In the court case that followed, Ramkrishna Dalmia was sentenced to two years in [[Tihar Jail]] after having been convicted of embezzlement and fraud.<ref name="newyorker"/>

But for most of the jail term he managed to spend in hospital. Upon his release, his son-in-law, [[Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain]], to whom he had entrusted the running of [[Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd.]] rebuffed his efforts to resume command of the company.<ref name="newyorker"/>

===Jain family (Shanti Prasad Jain)===
In the early 1960s, Shanti Prasad Jain was imprisoned on charges of selling newsprint on the black market.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19640505&id=-2JAAAAAIBAJ&pg=3701,623038&hl=en|title=Indian Millionaires arrested|publisher=[[Reuters]] ([[The Herald (Glasgow)]]), 5 May 1964|accessdate=6 May 2015}}</ref> And based on the Vivian Bose Commission's earlier report which found wrongdoings of the Dalmia – Jain group, that included specific charges against Shanti Prasad Jain, the [[Government of India]] filed a petition to restrain and remove the management of Bennett, Coleman and Company. Based on the pleading, the Justice directed the Government to assume control of the newspaper which resulted in replacing half of the directors and appointing a Bombay High Court judge as the Chairman.<ref name="KSage">{{cite book |last1=Khandekar |first1=Vanita Kohli |title=The Indian Media Business |date=9 November 2013 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location=Mumbai |isbn=978-8132113560 }}</ref>

===Under the Government of India===

[[File:The Times of India 2013 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|''The Times of India'' on a 2013 stamp]]
Following the Vivian Bose Commission report indicating serious wrongdoings of the Dalmia–Jain group, on 28 August 1969, the Bombay High Court, under Justice J. L. Nain, passed an interim order to disband the existing board of Bennett, Coleman & Co and to constitute a new board under the Government. The bench ruled that "Under these circumstances, the best thing would be to pass such orders on the assumption that the allegations made by the petitioners that the affairs of the company were being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest and to the interests of the Company are correct".<ref name="P.

Curiously, the court appointed [[Nanasaheb Kunte|D K Kunte]] as Chairman of the Board. Kunte had no prior business experience and was also an opposition member of the [[Lok Sabha]].

===Back to the Jain family===
In 1976, during the [[Emergency (India)|Emergency]] in India, the Government transferred ownership of the newspaper back to [[Ashok Kumar Jain]], who was Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain's son and Ramkrishna Dalmia's grandson. He is the father of the current owners [[Samir Jain]] and [[Vineet Jain]]).<ref name=Caravan>{{cite web| title=Supreme Being: How Samir Jain created the modern Indian newspaper industry| url=http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/supreme-being| work=[[The Caravan]]| date=1 December 2012| first=Samanth| last=Subramanian| accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> The Jains too often landed themselves in various money laundering scams and [[Ashok Kumar Jain]] had to flee the country when the [[Enforcement Directorate]] pursued his case strongly in 1998 for alleged violations of illegal transfer of funds (to the tune of US$1.25 million) to an overseas account in [[Switzerland]].<ref name="India Today">{{cite magazine| title=Trying times: Editorial changes in ''The Times of India'' raise disturbing questions| url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/a-b-vajpayee-accuse-i-k-gujral-of-shielding-tois-proprietor-ashok-jain-from-feras-case/1/274424.html| date=7 July 1997| magazine=[[India Today]]| accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=exp98>{{cite news |title=Ashok Jain arrested| url=http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/fe/daily/19980704/18555484.html |work=[[The Indian Express]]| date=4 July 1998 |accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref><ref name="Mahalingam flonnet&rdurl=fl1515/15151170.htm">{{cite web |title=Ashok Jain is arrested by the Enforcement Directorate| first=Sudha |last=Mahalingam |url=http://www.frontline.in/navigation/?type=static&page=flonnet&rdurl=fl1515/15151170.htm |volume=15| date=18–31 July 1998 |work=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]] | issue=15 |accessdate=10 November 2014| issn=0970-1710}}</ref><ref name="Fontline">{{cite web |title=A newspaper scandal: Editorial changes in ''The Times of India'' raise disturbing questions |url=http://www.frontline.in/navigation/?type=static&page=flonnet&rdurl=fl1512/15120860.htm |volume=15 |date=6–19 June 1998 |work=Frontline |issue = 12|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

===During the Emergency===
On 26 June 1975, the day after India declared [[The Emergency (India)|a state of emergency]], the [[Bombay]] edition of ''The Times of India'' carried an entry in its obituary column that read "D.E.M. O'Cracy, beloved husband of T.Ruth, father of L.I.Bertie, brother of Faith, Hope and Justice expired on 25 June".<ref name=austing>{{cite book  |last= Austin |first=Granville |title=Working a democratic constitution: the Indian experience |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195648881 |page=295 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=r42bAAAAMAAJ&q=times+of+india+obituary|url-access=subscription }}</ref> The move was a critique of Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]'s 21-month state of emergency, which is now widely known as "the Emergency" and seen by many as a roundly [[authoritarian]] era of Indian government.<ref name=IBN>{{cite news |title=New book flays Indira Gandhi's decision to impose Emergency |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/new-book-flays-indira-gandhis-decision-to-impose-emergency/706495.html |work=[[CNN-IBN|IBN Live News]] |date=30 May 2011 |accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Desai| first=Akshayakumar Ramanlal| title=Violation of Democratic Rights in India| date=17 November 1986| publisher=Popular Prakashan| location=Bombay| page=208| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9i5sNMNh_uIC&q=amnesty+the+emergency+india| accessdate=10 November 2014| isbn=978-0861321308}}</ref>

Rodrigues|author2=Maya Ranganathan|title=Indian News Media: From Observer to Participant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RqJCwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-93-5150-158-9|pages=121–127|chapter=Paid News: Cocktail of Media, Business and Politics}}</ref><ref name="Mudgal 2015 pp. 100–120">{{cite book | last=Mudgal | first=Vipul | title=Media Ethics and Justice in the Age of Globalization | chapter=News for Sale: ‘Paid News’, Media Ethics, and India’s Democratic Public Sphere | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | location=London | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-349-50520-3 | doi=10.1057/9781137498267_6 | pages=100–120}}</ref> The newspaper offers prominence with which the paid news is placed and the page on which it is displayed based on the amount of the payment. According to this practice, a payment plan assures a news feature and ensures positive coverage to the payer.<ref name="newyorker"/> In 2005, ''The Times of India'' began the practice of "private treaties", also called as "brand capital", where new companies, individuals or movies seeking mass coverage and public relations, major brands and organizations were offered sustained positive coverage and plugs in its news columns in exchange for shares or other forms of financial obligations to Bennett, Coleman & Company, Ltd. (B.C.C.L.) – the owners of ''The Times of India''.<ref name="newyorker"/><ref name="RodriguesRanganathan2014"/> The B.C.C.L., with its "private treaties" program, acquired stakes in 350 companies and generated 15% of its revenues by 2012, according to a critical article in ''[[The New Yorker]]''. The "paid news" and "private treaties" practice started by ''The Times of India'' has since been adopted by ''[[The Hindustan Times]]'' group, the ''[[India Today]]'' group, the ''[[Outlook (Indian magazine)|Outlook]]'' group, and other major media groups in India including Indian television channels.<ref name="newyorker"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://specials.indiatoday.com/specials/slideshow/power_list/jainbrothers_9.htm | publisher=IndiaToday | title=50 Powerful People}}</ref> This division of the company was later renamed [https://www.brandcapital.co.in/ Brand Capital] and has contracts in place with many companies in diverse sectors.

The "paid news" and "private treaties" blur the lines between content and advertising, with the favorable coverage written by the staff reporters on the payroll of ''The Times of India''.<ref name="newyorker"/> The newspaper has defended its practice in 2012 by stating that it includes a note of disclosure to the reader – though in a small font – that its contents are "advertorial, entertainment promotional feature", that they are doing this to generate revenues just like "all newspapers in the world do advertorials" according to ''The Times of India'' owners.<ref name="newyorker"/><ref name="RodriguesRanganathan2014"/> According to Maya Ranganathan, this overlap in the function of a journalist to also act as a marketing and advertisement revenue seeker for the newspaper raises conflict of interest questions, a problem that has morphed into ever-larger scale in India and recognized by India's SEBI authority in July 2009.<ref name="RodriguesRanganathan2014"/>

Under an ad sales initiative called Medianet, if a large company or Bollywood studio sponsored a news-worthy event, the event would be covered by the Times of India but the name of the company or studio that sponsored it will not be mentioned in the paper unless they paid the Times of India for advertising. In 2010, a report by a subcommittee of India's Press Council found that Medianet's paid news strategy had spread to a large number of newspapers and more than five hundred television channels.<ref name="newyorker"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Usha M. Rodrigues|author2=Maya Ranganathan|title=Indian News Media: From Observer to Participant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RqJCwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-93-5150-158-9|pages=123–125|chapter=Paid News: Cocktail of Media, Business and Politics}}</ref>

Critics state that the company's paid news and private treaties skew its coverage and shield its newspaper advertisers from scrutiny. [[The Hoot]], a media criticism website, has pointed out that when an elevator in a 19-storey luxury apartment complex in Bangalore crashed killing two workers and injuring seven, all the English language and [[Kannada]] language newspapers with the exception of the Times of India called out the name of the construction company, Sobha Developers, which was a private-treaty partner. An article titled "reaping gold through bt cotton," which first appeared in the Nagpur edition of the Times of India in 2008, reappeared unchanged in 2011, this time with a small print alert that the article was a "marketing feature". In both cases, the article was factually incorrect and made false claims about the success of [[Monsanto]]'s genetically modified cotton. According to a critical article published in the Indian magazine ''The Caravan'', when the [[Honda]] Motors plant in Gurgaon experienced an eight-month-long conflict between management and non-unionized workers over wages and work conditions in 2005, the ''Times of India'' covered the concerns of Honda and the harm done to India's investment climate and largely ignored the issues raised by workers.<ref name="newyorker"/>

[[Vineet Jain]], Managing Director of B.C.C.L., has insisted that a wall does exist between sales and the newsroom, and that the paper does not give favorable coverage to the company's business partners. "Our editors don’t know who we have," Jain said, although he later acknowledged that all private-treaty clients are listed on the company's Web site.<ref name="newyorker"/> Ravindra Dhariwal, the former CEO of B.C.C.L. had defended private treaties in a 2010 interview with the magazine ''[[Outlook (Indian magazine)|Outlook]]'' and claims that the partners in the private treaties sign contracts where they agree to clauses that they will not receive any favorable editorial coverage.

===Anti-competitive Behavior===

There have been claims that ''The Times of India'' would strike deals with advertisers only if they removed their advertisements from other competitor newspapers.<ref name="newyorker"/>

The Times of India is also embroiled in an active lawsuit against the [[Financial Times]]. In 1993, when the Financial Times was preparing to enter the Indian market, [[Samir Jain]], the Vice-Chairman of B.C.C.L., registered the term "Financial Times" as a trademark of his company and declared it his intellectual property in an attempt to stymie the Financial Times and prevent them from competing with [[the Economic Times]] which is owned by B.C.C.L.<ref name="newyorker"/>

In 1994, when the [[Hindustan Times]] was the top-selling paper in New Delhi, the Times of India slashed their prices by a third, to one and a half rupees after having built up their ads sales force in preparation for the price drop to make up for the lost circulation revenue. By 1998, [[the Hindustan Times]] had dropped to second place in Delhi. The Times of India took a similar strategy in Bangalore where they dropped the price to one rupee despite protests from [[Siddharth Varadarajan]], one of the editors of the newspaper at the time, who called the strategy "predatory pricing".<ref name="newyorker"/>

===Cobrapost Sting Operation===
In 2018, [[Vineet Jain]], Managing Director of B.C.C.L., and Sanjeev Shah, executive president of B.C.C.L., were caught on camera as part of an undercover sting operation by [[Cobrapost]] agreeing to promote Hindutva content through the group's many media properties for a proposed spend of ₹500 crore, some of which the client said could only be paid with black money.<ref>{{ cite news | url=https://thewire.in/media/times-group-vineet-jain-sting-operation-cobrapost | publisher=The Wire | title=At the Times Group, Cobrapost Sting Shows How Cash is King}}</ref> B.C.C.L. has responded to the sting claiming that the video that was released by [[Cobrapost]] was incomplete and doctored and that Vineet Jain was engaged in a counter-sting of his own to expose the undercover reporter during the filming of the video.<ref>{{ cite news | url=https://thewire.in/media/times-group-says-vineet-jain-was-conducting-reverse-sting-on-cobrapost | publisher=The Wire | title=Times Group Says Vineet Jain Was Conducting 'Reverse Sting' on Cobrapost}}</ref>

===Legal action by The Doon School Old Boys' Society===
In 2018, [[The Doon School Old Boys' Society]] threatened legal action against the publication for negligence and defamation, when the newspaper reported a rape and murder case in a [[Dehradun]] school with the phrase "Doon school" in its headline, to imply a school located in the [[Doon Valley]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sarkar|first=Gaurav|title=Doon School Old Boys Society threatens to take legal action against TOI|url=https://www.newslaundry.com/2018/09/19/doon-school-old-boys-society-threatens-to-take-legal-action-against-toi|access-date=2020-07-27|website=Newslaundry|language=en}}</ref> Consequently, the newspaper corrected the headline of the online edition to mention "Dehradun school", and included a disclaimer at the start of the story, stating: "The headline of this story has been changed. It mentioned 'Doon school' which is incorrect. This was an inadvertent error which has been corrected. Our apologies. The school mentioned in the story has no connection with The Doon School."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/dehradun-school-covers-up-gang-rape-of-minor-by-seniors-asks-her-to-abort/articleshow/65862425.cms |title=Dehradun school covers up gang rape of minor by seniors, asks her to abort &#124; Dehradun News - Times of India |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2018-09-19 |accessdate=2020-05-04}}</ref>

===Fake News===
Times of India carried out a story<ref name="TOI Fake news 1">{{cite news |title=Fake news about PV Sindhu |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/badminton/sindhu-quits-national-camp-over-personal-issues-reaches-london/articleshow/78758810.cms |accessdate=20 October 2020 |agency=TOI |publisher=TOI |ref=TOI Fake news 1}}</ref> about [[P.
