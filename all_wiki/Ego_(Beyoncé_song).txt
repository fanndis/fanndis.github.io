"'''Ego'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Beyoncé]] for the deluxe edition of her third studio album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008). The song was composed by [[Blac Elvis|Elvis Williams]], [[Harold Lilly (songwriter)|Harold Lilly]], and Beyoncé. "Ego" was officially remixed with additional vocals from [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artist, [[Kanye West]]. Initially planned to be released in January 2009 as the second urban single in the US along with the fourth US and third international single "[[Halo (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Halo]]", the release of "Ego" was canceled and replaced by "[[Diva (Beyoncé song)|Diva]]". "Ego" was later serviced as the third urban single, and fifth overall single in the US on May 19, 2009 alongside the sixth US and fourth international single "[[Sweet Dreams (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Sweet Dreams]]".

"Ego" was originally written for singer [[Chrisette Michele]], who turned it down. It was eventually proposed to Beyoncé who used it for the deluxe edition of ''I Am... Sasha Fierce''. In the song, Beyoncé sings about her love for the "huge ego" of her [[Romantic interest|love interest]]. "Ego" was generally well received by music critics, many of whom praised the fact that Beyoncé opted to show some of her vocal limitations in a part of the song. Critics also noted that "Ego" could even have been placed in either disc of ''I Am.. Sasha Fierce'' as it combines elements of both sides of Beyoncé's split musical personality. The remix version of "Ego" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration|Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[52nd Grammy Awards]].

"Ego" became the fifth consecutive song from ''I Am... Sasha Fierce'' to reach the top 40 on US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at 39. It reached number three on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Despite not being released elsewhere, "Ego" reached number 11 in New Zealand and number 60 in the United Kingdom, among others. Its music video was directed by Frank Gatson, Jr, and was co-directed by Beyoncé herself, thus becoming her directorial debut. A video was also filmed for the remix version of the song with Kanye West. "Ego" was a part of Beyoncé's [[set list]] on her [[I Am... World Tour]] (2009–10).

==Critical reception==
"Ego" received positive reviews from critics, most of whom wrote that "Ego", which is featured on the ''Sasha Fierce'' disc, could have also been placed on the ''I Am...'' disc since the lyrics seem to showcase vulnerability and the desire to be loved back while the music is completely fun like Beyoncé's [[alter ego]]. A writer for [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine gave the song a positive review, writing that "Ego" manages to combine elements of both sides of Beyoncé's musical personality. He said that the song seems to be an homage to "old-school R&B midtempo jams". He went on to praise Beyoncé's vocals, which according to him, she did not polish during the interlude, thus showing her real voice and limitations "just like the old days".<ref name="bill">{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_BHvp8mcJfAoC |quote=Billboard May 2009 Beyonce Ego. |title=The Billboard Reviews - Singles |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_BHvp8mcJfAoC/page/n55 54] |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=2009-09-14 |issn=0006-2510|accessdate=2009-11-30}}</ref> Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine]] was brief and said that the song could benefit from the first half of the album.<ref name="Cinquemani">Cinquemani, Sal.

Beyoncé made her directorial debut on the [[music video|video]] for "Ego" with the choreographer Frank Gatson Jr, who had been working with her for twelve years by then, as the creative director.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andre |url=http://ontheflix.com/2009/07/05/beyonce-knowles-shows-off-her-big-ego/ |title=Beyonce Knowles Shows Off Her Big 'Ego' |publisher=On The Fix (Entertainment News & Stuff) |date=2009-07-05|accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref> Gatson has been the creative director for many of her videos, such as "[[Suga Mama]]", "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", and "[[Get Me Bodied]]", as well as her last three world tours, including the [[I Am...

Like the music videos for "If I Were a Boy", "Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)", and "Diva", the one for "Ego" was shot in [[black and white]].<ref name="rap7">{{cite web |url=http://www.rap-up.com/2009/05/21/video-beyonce-ego/ |title=Video: Beyoncé – 'Ego' |date=2009-05-21 |accessdate=2010-12-09 |work=Rap-Up |publisher=Devin Lazerine}}</ref> The word "bitch" is muted out when Beyoncé sings, "I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch!". "Ego" is the first video from ''I Am... Sasha Fierce'' in which she has curly afro hair, similar to the one in "[[Work It Out (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Work It Out]]". It is also the first video from the ''Sasha Fierce'' disc of her album where she does not don her robot-glove.<ref name="insp" /><ref name="rap4">{{cite web |url=http://www.rap-up.com/2009/03/10/beyonce-selects-third-singles-shoots-videos/ |title=Beyoncé Selects Third Singles, Shoots Videos |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2010-12-09 |work=Rap-Up |publisher=Devin Lazerine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65sCdEJ7y?url=http://www.rap-up.com/2009/03/10/beyonce-selects-third-singles-shoots-videos/ |archive-date=2012-03-02 }}</ref> The video features Beyoncé and her two backup female dancers all dressed in silver leotards and performing similar choreography, which has reminiscence of that of "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". Later, Beyoncé sits on a white glittery chair in front of the same tiled background; she is wearing black coat and the two dancers are still dancing in unison around her. There are a few shots of her on the chair facing the back of the camera with the dancers doing the same.<ref name="MT">{{cite web|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2009/06/09/s-you-so-need-to-get-beyonces-stuart-weitzman-ego-heels/ |title=S+++ You So Need To Get: Beyonce's Stuart Weitzman 'Ego' Heels |publisher=MTV.

This scene ends as they walk to the left of the camera, into the next scene. Beyoncé is still with the tiled background. She and her dancers are now holding poles as props with which they dance. During the same pole scene, some shots of her singing in the chair are intercut. In the next scene, with the same tiled background, Beyoncé is leaning against the wall as the bridge of the song has been reached. Her dancers spin in heels around her, and they all then continue to dance against the wall.<ref name="MT"/> The last scene shows Beyoncé in the chair, without the black jacket and still dancing until the song ends.

===Release and reception===
A "bootlegged" version of the music video, featuring Sheryl Murakami performing the choreography, was leaked onto [[YouTube]] in early March 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/item_S4HQKSEYyDxAGpqEkzJ0xO |title=Choreography For Beyoncé's Next Single "Ego" Leaked |work=[[New York Post]] |publisher=[[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2009-11-30 |first=Ryan |last=Brockington |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130013041/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/item_S4HQKSEYyDxAGpqEkzJ0xO |archive-date=2011-11-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the B-roll footage on ''Above and Beyoncé'', it was shown that a clay sculpture of Beyoncé was made for the video of "Ego".

Upon its release, the music video for "Ego" received mixed reviews from music critics who noted similarities with the one for "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". A writer of ''Rap-Up'' magazine described the video as "Single Ladies (Part 2)".<ref name="rap7" /> Tracey Ford of [[AOL]] described the video as "an ode to multiple personalities, leotards and all things 'diva.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theboombox.com/2009/05/27/beyonce-ego-new-video/|title=Beyonce, 'Ego' -- New Video|work=The Boombox|publisher=[[AOL]]|first=Tracey|last=Ford|date=2009-05-27|accessdate=2013-05-11}}</ref> Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented that the video would divide critics' opinions whether it is "a sexy, [[burlesque]]-inspired variation on the theme [Beyoncé] established in the other two videos from the ''Sasha Fierce'' side of the album, or just a 'Single Ladies' retread with more crotch and rump".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/thesound/a156793/the-new-beyonce-video-what-do-you-think.html|title=The new Beyoncé video... what do you think?|publisher=Digital Spy.

And the boob grabbing is a little too gratuitous. And when Beyonce says 'It's too big, it's too wide, it's too strong, it won't fit, it's too much,' I'm not even positive that she's really referring to an ego."<ref name="MT" />
