A '''Bond girl''' is a character who is a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] or female companion of [[James Bond]] in a novel, film or video game. Bond girls occasionally have names that are [[double entendre]]s or [[pun]]s, such as [[Pussy Galore]], [[Plenty O'Toole]], [[Xenia Onatopp]], or [[Holly Goodhead]].

A Bond girl can also refer to an actress playing a Bond girl, such as [[Ursula Andress]], [[Honor Blackman]] or [[Sophie Marceau]].

There is no set rule on what kind of person a Bond girl will be or what role she will play. She may be an ally or an enemy of Bond, pivotal to the mission or simply there for her looks. There are female characters such as [[Judi Dench]]'s [[M (James Bond)|M]], and [[Camille Montes]], a Bolivian intelligence agent who teams up with Bond in ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', who are not romantic interests of Bond, and hence not strictly Bond girls.{{sfn|Jütting|2007|p=65}}{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=34}}{{sfn|Comentale|Watt|Willman|2005|p=134}} However, it has been argued that M's pivotal role in the plot of ''[[Skyfall]]'' qualifies her as a Bond girl or Bond woman.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Peter|title=Skyfall – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/25/skyfall-review|accessdate=6 May 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Slater|first1=Tom|title=Judi Dench: the ultimate Bond girl|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/13051#.VyyA2fmLRdh|website=spiked-online.com|accessdate=6 May 2016|date=2 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Alyssa|title=The End of the Bond Girl and the Rise of the Bond Woman|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/11/09/skyfall_and_the_end_of_the_bond_girl_she_s_a_bond_woman_now.html|website=slate.com|accessdate=6 May 2016|date=9 November 2012}}</ref>

Nearly all of [[Ian Fleming]]'s Bond novels and short stories include one or more female characters who can be said to qualify as Bond girls, most of whom have been adapted for the screen. While Fleming's Bond girls have some individual traits (at least in their literary forms), they also have a great many characteristics in common.<ref>For a general discussion of the characteristics of the Fleming Bond girl, see the relevant chapters of O. F. Snelling, ''007 James Bond: A Report'' (Signet, 1965).</ref> One of these is age: The typical Bond girl is in her early to mid-twenties, roughly ten years younger than Bond, who seems to be perennially in his mid-thirties.<ref>[[James Bond (literary character)#Background]]</ref> Examples include Solitaire (25),<ref name="Fleming-Live-ch10">Fleming, Ian, ''Live and Let Die'' (MacMillan, 1954), ch. 10.</ref> [[Tatiana Romanova]] (24),<ref name="Fleming-Russia-ch9">Fleming, Ian, ''From Russia, With Love'' (MacMillan, 1957), ch. 9.</ref> [[Vivienne Michel|Vivienne "Viv" Michel]] (23),<ref name="Fleming-Spy-ch2">Fleming, Ian, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' (Glidrose, 1962), ch. 2.</ref> and [[Kissy Suzuki]] (23).<ref name="Fleming-You-ch12">Fleming, Ian, ''You Only Live Twice'' (Glidrose, 1964), ch. 12.</ref> The youngest Bond girl (though she and Bond do not sleep together) may be [[Gala Brand]];{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} she is named for the [[cruiser]] in which her father is serving at the time of her birth.<ref name="Fleming-Moonraker-ch16">Fleming, Ian, ''Moonraker'' (MacMillan, 1955), ch. 16.</ref> Bond's youngest sexual partner in the books is Mariko Ichiban, an 18-year-old masseuse in ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]''. The eldest Bond girls are [[Pussy Galore]], who Bond speculates is in her early 30s, and 29-year-old [[Domino Vitali]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Bond girls conform to a fairly well-defined standard of beauty. They possess splendid figures and tend to dress in a slightly masculine, assertive fashion, wear little jewellery—and that in a masculine cut—wide leather belts, and square-toed leather shoes. (There is some variation in dress, though: Bond girls have made their initial appearances in evening wear, in [[bra]] and [[panties]] and, on occasion, naked.) Most are [[White people|white]]; they often sport light though noticeable suntans (although a few, such as Solitaire, Tatiana Romanova, and Pussy Galore, are not only tanless but remarkably pale<ref name="Fleming-Live-ch10" /><ref name="Fleming-Russia-ch8">''From Russia, With Love'', ch. 8</ref><ref name="Fleming-Goldfinger-ch17">Fleming, Ian, Goldfinger (Glidrose, 1959), ch. 17.</ref>), and they generally use little or no makeup and no nail polish, also wearing their nails short.<ref>Snelling, ''007 James Bond: A Report''.</ref> Their hair may be any colour,<ref name="Fleming-Russia-ch8" /><ref>Fleming, Ian, ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' (Glidrose, 1965), ch. 4</ref><ref name="Fleming-Live-ch7">Fleming, Ian, ''Live and Let Die'' (MacMillan, 1954), ch. 7.</ref><ref name="Fleming-Casino-ch5">Fleming, Ian, ''Casino Royale'' (Glidrose, 1953), ch. 5.</ref> though they typically wear it in a natural or casual cut that falls heavily to their shoulders. Their features, especially their eyes and mouths, are often widely spaced (e.g. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, [[Tiffany Case]], Tatiana Romanova, [[Honey Rider|Honey Ryder]], Viv Michel, Mary Goodnight).<ref>Fleming, Ian, ''Casino Royale'' (Glidrose, 1953), ch. 5; ibid., ''Moonraker'' (MacMillan, 1955), ch. 11; ibid., ''Diamonds are Forever'' (MacMillan, 1956), ch. 5; ibid., ''From Russia, With Love'' (MacMillan, 1957), ch. 8; ibid., ''Doctor No'' (Glidrose, 1958), ch. 8; ibid., ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' (Glidrose, 1962), ch. 2; ibid., ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' (Glidrose, 1965), ch. 4.</ref> Their eyes are usually blue (e.g. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, Tatiana Romanova, Honey Ryder, [[Tracy Bond]], Mary Goodnight),<ref>Fleming, Ian, ''Casino Royale'' (Glidrose, 1953), ch. 5; ibid., ''Live and Let Die'' (MacMillan, 1954), ch. 7; ibid., ''Moonraker'' (MacMillan, 1955), ch. 11; ibid., ''From Russia, With Love'' (MacMillan, 1957), ch. 8; ibid., ''Doctor No'' (Glidrose, 1958), ch. 8; ibid., ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' (Glidrose, 1962), ch. 2; ibid., ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' (Glidrose, 1963), ch. 3; ibid., ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' (Glidrose, 1965), ch. 4.</ref> and sometimes this is true to an unusual and striking degree: Tiffany Case's eyes are [[chatoyance|chatoyant]], varying with the light from grey to grey-blue,<ref name="Fleming-Diamonds-ch5">Fleming, Ian, ''Diamonds are Forever'' (MacMillan, 1956), ch. 5.</ref> while Pussy Galore has deep violet eyes, the only truly violet eyes that Bond had ever seen.<ref name="Fleming-Goldfinger-ch17" /> The first description of a Bond girl, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale's]]'' [[Vesper Lynd]], is almost a template for the typical dress as well as the general appearance of later Bond girls; she sports nearly all of the features discussed above.<ref name="Fleming-Casino-ch5"/> In contrast, [[Domino Vitali|Dominetta "Domino" Vitali]] arguably departs to the greatest degree from the template, dressing in white leather [[doeskin]] sandals, appearing more tanned, sporting a soft [[Brigitte Bardot]] haircut, and giving no indication of widely spaced features.<ref name="Fleming-Thunderball-ch11">Fleming, Ian, ''Thunderball'' (Glidrose, 1961), ch. 11</ref> (The departure may be due to the [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|unusual circumstances]] behind the writing of the novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'', in which Domino appears.) Even Domino, however, wears rather masculine jewellery.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fleming|first1=Ian|title=Thunderball|date=1961|publisher=[[Jonathan Cape]]}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}

The best-known characteristic of Bond girls apart from their uniform beauty is their pattern of sexually suggestive names, such as Pussy Galore. Names with less obvious meanings are sometimes explained in the novels. While Solitaire's real name is Simone Latrelle, she is known as Solitaire because she excludes men from her life;<ref name="Fleming-Live-ch7" /> Gala Brand, as noted above, is named for her father's cruiser, [[HMS Galatea (71)|HMS ''Galatea'']]; and Tiffany Case received her name from her father, who was so angry that she was not a boy that he gave her mother a thousand dollars and a compact from [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany's]] and then walked out on her.<ref name="Fleming-Diamonds-ch22">Fleming, Ian, ''Diamonds are Forever'' (MacMillan, 1956), ch. 22.</ref> Fleming's penchant for double-entendre names began with the first Bond novel ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''. Conjecture is widespread that the name of the Bond girl in that novel, "Vesper Lynd," was intended to be a pun on "West Berlin," signifying Vesper's divided loyalties as a double agent under Soviet control. Several Bond girls, however, have normal names (e.g. Tatiana Romanova, Mary Ann Russell, Judy Havelock, Viv Michel, Tracy Bond (née Teresa Draco, aka Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Most Bond girls are apparently (and sometimes expressly) sexually experienced by the time they meet Bond. Quite often those previous experiences have not been positive, and many Bond girls have had sexual violence inflicted on them in the past which has caused them to feel alienated from all men—until Bond comes along. Tiffany Case was [[Types of rape#Group rape|gang-raped]] as a teenager;<ref name="Fleming-Diamonds-ch8">Fleming, Ian, ''Diamonds are Forever'' (MacMillan, 1956), ch. 8.</ref> Honey Ryder, too, was beaten and raped as a teenager by a drunken acquaintance.<ref name="Fleming-DoctorNo-ch11">Fleming, Ian, ''Doctor No'' (Glidrose, 1958), ch. 11.</ref> Pussy Galore was sexually abused at age 12 by her uncle.<ref name="Fleming-Goldfinger-ch23">Fleming, Ian, ''Goldfinger'' (Glidrose, 1959), ch. 23.</ref> While there is no such clear-cut trauma in Solitaire's early life, there are suggestions that she, too, avoids men because of their unwanted sexual advances in her past. Kissy Suzuki reports to Bond that during her brief career in Hollywood, when she was 17, "They thought that because I am Japanese I am some sort of an animal and that my body is for everyone."<ref name="Fleming-You-ch14">Fleming, Ian, ''You Only Live Twice'' (Glidrose, 1964), ch. 14.</ref> The implication is often that these violent episodes have turned the Bond girls in question against men, though upon encountering Bond they overcome their earlier antipathy and sleep with him not only willingly but eagerly. The cliché reaches its most extreme level in ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]''. In this novel Pussy Galore is portrayed as a practising lesbian when she first meets Bond, but at the end of the novel she sleeps with him. When, in bed, he says to her, "They told me you only liked women," she replies, "I never met a man before."<ref name="Fleming-Goldfinger-ch23" />

In Fleming's novels, many Bond girls have some sort of independent job or even career, often one that was considered inappropriate for women in the 1950s. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, Tatiana Romanova, Mary Ann Russell, and Mary Goodnight are in intelligence or law-enforcement work. Those who are criminals, such as Tiffany Case and Pussy Galore, tend to be similarly independent-minded in how they approach their work—the latter even running her own syndicate. Even those Bond girls who have more conventional or glamorous jobs show themselves to be invested in having an independent outlook on life. While the Bond girls are clearly intended as [[Sexual objectification|sex objects]], they are nevertheless portrayed in the novels as having a high degree of independence; this is also frequently (but not always) the case in the films.

Most of the novels focus on one particular romance, as some of them do not begin until well into the novel (''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' is a good example). However, several exceptions have been made: In ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'', the Masterton sisters are considered Bond girls (although Tilly is supposedly a lesbian), and after their deaths, [[Pussy Galore]] (also supposedly a lesbian) becomes the primary Bond girl. In ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'', Bond romances first Patricia Fearing, then later [[Domino Vitali]]. In ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', Bond enters into a relationship and an eventual marriage with [[Tracy Bond|Teresa 'Tracy' di Vicenzo]], and sleeps with Ruby Windsor, a patient he meets in Blofeld's hideout while posing as a genealogist. In ''You Only Live Twice'', Bond mainly has a relationship with Kissy Suzuki, but also romances Mariko Ichiban, as well as another a girl.

Several Bond girls have obvious signs of inner turmoil (Vesper Lynd or Vivienne Michel), and others have traumatic pasts. Most Bond girls whose characters are allowed to develop in the course of the story are flawed, and several have unhappy sexual backgrounds (Honey Ryder, Pussy Galore, Tiffany Case, Vivienne Michel, and Kissy Suzuki, among others).

===Inspiration===
The inspiration for all of Fleming's Bond girls may be his onetime lover Muriel Wright, who according to ''The Times''<ref name="macintyre20080405">{{Cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/specials/for_your_eyes_only/article3652410.ece |title=Was Ian Fleming the real 007? |last=Macintyre, Ben |date=5 April 2008 |work=The Times |access-date=8 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531130411/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/specials/for_your_eyes_only/article3652410.ece |archive-date=31 May 2010 |location=London |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

{{quote|has a claim to be the ''[[fons et origo]]'' of the species: pliant and undemanding, beautiful but innocent, outdoorsy, physically tough, implicitly vulnerable and uncomplaining, and then tragically dead, before or soon after marriage.}}

Wright was 26 and "exceptionally beautiful" when she and Fleming met in 1935. A talented rider, skier, and polo player, Wright was independently wealthy and a model. She was devoted to Fleming, despite his repeated unfaithfulness. She died in an air raid in 1944, devastating Fleming, who called Wright "too good to be true".{{r|macintyre20080405}}

==In film==

[[Ursula Andress]] (as [[Honey Ryder]]) in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962) is widely regarded as the first Bond girl,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://magazine.foxnews.com/celebrity/get-look-bond-girl-bikinis|title=Get The Look: Bond Girl Bikinis|publisher=Fox News Magazine|date=5 November 2012|accessdate=18 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902235005/http://magazine.foxnews.com/celebrity/get-look-bond-girl-bikinis|archive-date=2 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> although she was preceded by both [[Eunice Gayson]] as Sylvia Trench and [[Zena Marshall]] as Miss Taro in the same film.<ref>{{cite news |first=Brigid |last=Brown |title=The Early Bond Girls: Where Are They Now? |date=8 November 2012 |url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2012/11/the-early-bond-girls-where-are-they-now/ |accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref> ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964), the third, established the Bond girl as regularly appearing in Bond films.{{r|watson}}

There have been many attempts to break down the numerous Bond girls into a top 10 list for the entire series; characters who often appear in these lists include [[Anya Amasova]] (from [[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|''The Spy Who Loved Me'']], portrayed by [[Barbara Bach]]); [[Pussy Galore]] (from [[Goldfinger (film)|''Goldfinger'']], portrayed by [[Honor Blackman]]); [[Tracy Bond|Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo]] (from [[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'']], portrayed by [[Diana Rigg]]); and often ranked Number 1 on the list, [[Honey Rider|Honey Ryder]] (from [[Dr. No (film)|''Dr. No'']], portrayed by [[Ursula Andress]]).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1557446_11,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=The 10 Best Bond Girls – EW.com}}</ref><ref>[http://au.babes.entertainment.ign.com/articles/746/746292p1.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226092616/http://au.babes.entertainment.ign.com/articles/746/746292p1.html |date=26 February 2007 }}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' put "Bond bathing suits" on its end-of-the-decade, "best-of" list, saying, "And you thought spies were supposed to be inconspicuous! [[Halle Berry]]'s orange bikini in ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002) and [[Daniel Craig]]'s supersnug powder blue trunks in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006) suggest that neither 007 star can keep a secret."<ref>Geier, Thom; Jensen, Jeff; Jordan, Tina; Lyons, Margaret; Markovitz, Adam; Nashawaty, Chris; Pastorek, Whitney; Rice, Lynette; Rottenberg, Josh; Schwartz, Missy; Slezak, Michael; Snierson, Dan; Stack, Tim; Stroup, Kate; Tucker, Ken; Vary, Adam B.; Vozick-Levinson, Simon; Ward, Kate (11 December 2009), "The 100 Greatest Movies, TV Shows, Albums, Books, Characters, Scenes, Episodes, Songs, Dresses, Music Videos, and Trends That Entertained Us Over the Past 10 Years".

[[Monica Bellucci]] in ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' became the oldest Bond girl at the age of 50, although she stated that she does not consider herself to be a "Bond girl", but a "Bond woman".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4039266/monica-bellucci-bond-woman/|title=Monica Bellucci Says She Is a Bond Woman, Not a Bond Girl|first=Megan|last=McCluskey|website=Time|accessdate=1 October 2017}}</ref>

===Roles and impact===
[[Roald Dahl]] said that when writing ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', he was advised to use three Bond girls: The first should die "preferably in Bond's arms" early, the second a villain whom Bond seduces before she dies in an unusual and gory way midway, and the third survives to the end of the film.<ref name="watson">{{Cite magazine

Examples are [[List of characters in Never Say Never Again#Fatima Blush|Fatima Blush]] ([[Barbara Carrera]]) in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983), [[Elektra King]] ([[Sophie Marceau]]) in ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' (1999), and Miranda Frost ([[Rosamund Pike]]) in ''Die Another Day'' (2002).  The Dalton films of the 1980s introduced the "Bond woman", who is equal to and challenges Bond, but he remains the heterosexual hero; they are depicted with Dalton and later Bonds and their cars and gadgets, implying that all are possessions that Bond can use and dispose.{{r|watson}}

As of 2013, there have been only two films in which James Bond falls in love with the Bond girl. The first was ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'' (1969), in which [[Tracy Bond|Countess Tracy di Vicenzo]] ([[Diana Rigg]]) marries Bond but is shot dead by Irma Bunt and [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] at the story's end. The second was [[Vesper Lynd]] ([[Eva Green]]) in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006). Bond confesses his love to her and resigns from MI6 so that they can have a normal life together. He later learns that she had been a double agent working for his enemies. The enemy organisation [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] had kidnapped her former lover and had been blackmailing her to secure her co-operation. She ends up actually falling in love with Bond, but dies, as Quantum is closing in on her, by drowning in a lift in a building under renovation in [[Venice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movieweb.com/eva-green-is-vesper-lynd-in-casino-royale/|title=Eva Green is Vesper Lynd in 'Casino Royale'|publisher=Movie Web|date=12 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/spectre-james-bond-24-quantum-mr-white/|title='Quantum of Solace's Mr. White Says He's Returning for 'Spectre'|website=Screen Rant|date=4 December 2014|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>

With the exception of these two doomed Bond girls, it is never explained why Bond's love interest in one film is gone by the next, and is never mentioned or even alluded to again. This is not always the case in the novels, which do sometimes make references to the Bond girls who have appeared in previous books. Tiffany Case and Honey Ryder are revealed to have married other men (in ''From Russia With Love'' and ''The Man With the Golden Gun'' respectively), and in ''Doctor No'', Bond briefly wonders about Solitaire. In John Gardner's novels continuing the franchise Bond girls begin to appear in more than one book, often picking up their relationships with Bond from before, and in one case continuing a romance through two consecutive titles. In ''[[Licence Renewed]]'' it is specifically noted in an epilogue that Bond and Lavender Peacock stopped seeing each other after a brief romance, but Sukie Tempesta (''[[Nobody Lives for Ever]]''), Beatrice Maria da Ricci (''[[Win, Lose or Die]]''), and Fredericka von Grüsse (''[[Never Send Flowers]]'') all make return appearances in later books.  Anthony Horowitz's ''[[Trigger Mortis]]'' picks up two weeks after the events in ''Goldfinger'' with Bond continuing his relationship with Pussy Galore. A unique case is Mary Goodnight, who appears in the novels, ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' and ''You Only Live Twice'' as Bond's secretary, before becoming a full-fledged Bond girl in ''The Man With the Golden Gun''.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Effect on career===
The role of a Bond girl, as it has evolved in the films, is typically a high-profile part that can sometimes give a major boost to the career of unestablished actresses, although a number of Bond girls were well-established beforehand. For instance, [[Diana Rigg]] and [[Honor Blackman]] were both cast as Bond girls after they had already become stars in the United Kingdom for their roles in the television series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''. In addition, [[Halle Berry]] won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 2002—the award was presented to her while she was filming ''[[Die Another Day]]''. [[Teri Hatcher]] was already known for her role as Lois Lane in the television series ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' before she was cast in ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]''. A few years after playing a Bond girl, she became one of the most highly paid actresses on television, starring in ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''.  [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] was an unknown when she was cast in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (the opening credits read "Introducing Jane Seymour"), later won an [[Emmy]] Award for playing [[Maria Callas]] in a TV movie and then became a household name playing the title role in her TV series ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/05/03/403579972/from-bond-girl-to-medicine-woman-jane-seymours-big-break|title=From Bond Girl To Medicine Woman: Jane Seymour's Big Break|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-09-29|language=en}}</ref> [[Kim Basinger]] had perhaps the most successful post-Bond career. After her break-out role in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', Basinger went on to win an [[Academy Award]] for her performance in ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' and to star in a number of blockbuster films, including ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', over the next two decades.

[[Albert R. Broccoli|Broccoli’s]] original choice for the role of [[Domino Derval]] was [[Julie Christie]] following her performance in ''[[Billy Liar (film)|Billy Liar]]'' in 1963. It seems he was disappointed when he met her so instead he considered [[Raquel Welch]] after seeing her on the cover of the October 1964 issue of [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine. Welch, however, was hired by [[Richard Zanuck]] of [[20th Century Fox]] to appear in the film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' the same year instead.<ref name="mi6">{{cite web|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/tb_production.php3?t=tb&s=tb|title=Production notes for Thunderball|accessdate=30 December 2007|publisher=MI6.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218123749/http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/tb_production.php3?t=tb&s=tb|archivedate=18 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> French actress [[Claudine Auger]] was ultimately cast in the role. ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' launched Auger into a successful European film career but did little for her in the [[United States]].<ref name= "no boost">{{cite news| title = Bond Was No Boost For Auger | url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-29/entertainment/ca-16048_1_claudine-auger| first= Roderick | last= Mann | date= 29 November 1986 | accessdate= 21 July 2012 | work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

At one time, it was said that appearing as a Bond girl would damage an actress's career. [[Lois Chiles]] is often cited as a case in point, even though her career did not suffer because of her portrayal of [[Holly Goodhead]], but rather because, after she lost her younger brother to [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], she decided to take a three-year break from acting, from which her career never recovered. Casting for the female lead in ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006) was hindered by potential actresses' concerns about the effect that playing the role might have on their careers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.com/news/item/3817/curse-of-the-bond-girl.phtml |title=Curse of the Bond Girl |publisher=Cinema.com |date=25 April 2001 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> At that point, some thought that the Bond series had become stale and would therefore be a less desirable vehicle for young actresses. Nevertheless, the up-and-coming actress [[Eva Green]] agreed to play the role of Vesper Lynd, and showed those fears to be unfounded when she won [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]'s [[Rising Star Award, BAFTA|Rising Star Award]] for her performance. [[Rosamund Pike]], who made her feature film debut as Miranda Frost in ''[[Die Another Day]]'' (2002), went on to earn an Academy Award Nomination for ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]''.

===Multiple appearances===
Prior to the series being rebooted in 2006 with ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', Sylvia Trench was the only Bond girl character to appear in more than one film (''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' in 1962 and ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' in 1963). She was meant to be Bond's regular girlfriend, but was dropped after her appearance in the second film.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}. After the series was rebooted, Moneypenny was re-introduced in ''[[Skyfall]]'' (2012) as an agent assisting Bond in his mission and her characterisation was closer to that of a Bond girl; following her demotion at the end of ''Skyfall'' the character returned for the next film, ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015), as M's personal assistant and the characterisation of Moneypenny was closer to that of the original series. [[Léa Seydoux]], who played Madeleine Swann in ''Spectre'', will reprise her role in ''[[No Time to Die]]'' (2021).

In the series of films, six actresses have made reappearances as different Bond girls: [[Martine Beswick]] and [[Nadja Regin]] both first appeared in ''From Russia with Love'', and then appeared in ''Thunderball'' and ''Goldfinger'' respectively. [[Maud Adams]] played Andrea Anders in ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' (1974) and the eponymous character in ''[[Octopussy]]'' (1983).

If the non-Eon produced films, ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' and ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', are included, several actresses have also been a Bond girl more than once: Ursula Andress in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962) and ''Casino Royale''; [[Angela Scoular]] in ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' (1969) and ''Casino Royale''; [[Valerie Leon]] in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1977) and ''Never Say Never Again''.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Mary Goodnight was a supporting character in several Bond novels before graduating to full Bond girl in ''The Man with the Golden Gun''. Several short stories, such as "Quantum of Solace", "The Hildebrand Rarity", "The Living Daylights", and "The Property of a Lady" feature female characters in prominent roles, but none of these women interact with Bond in a romantic way.

===Eon Productions films===
There are several different archetypes for Bond girls: romantic interests, those who assist him, [[femme fatale]]s (who invariably make an attempt on Bond's life), and [[sacrificial lamb]]s (female associates of Bond who wind up dead).<ref>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Persall |title=Four kinds of unforgettable Bond girls |date=7 November 2012 |url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/movies/four-kinds-of-unforgettable-bond-girls/1260412 |accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> Since it is debatable whether certain girls fulfill certain tropes (i.e. If Bond kisses a girl does that make her a romantic interest? Is Pussy Galore a "femme fatale" due to her being in league with Goldfinger?) the following criteria are used for determining inclusion: women with whom sexual encounters are implied; the woman who principally assists Bond; femme fatales are taken to be women who attempt to kill Bond; sacrificial lambs are taken to be women with an allegiance to Bond whose death is instigated by the main villain or his henchmen.

==Documentary==
In 2002 former Bond girl [[Maryam d'Abo]] co-wrote the book ''[[Bond Girls Are Forever]]: The Women of James Bond''. This book later became a DVD exclusive documentary featuring d'Abo and other Bond girls, including Ursula Andress. In some locations, the documentary was released as a gift with the purchase of ''[[Die Another Day]]'' on DVD. The featurette was included on the DVD release of ''Casino Royale'' (2006).

==Critical studies==
In 2003, scholarly critiques of Pussy Galore and Miss Moneypenny, authored by Professors Elizabeth Ladenson and Tara Brabazon, respectively, were published in ''The James Bond Phenomenon: A Critical Reader''.<ref>Lindner, Christoph, ed., ''The James Bond Phenomenon: A Critical Reader'' (Manchester University, 2003), chs. 11–12.</ref> In 2009, researchers at [[Cleveland State University]] and [[Kent State University]] published an article, ''Shaken and Stirred: A Content Analysis of Women's Portrayals in James Bond Films'', which provided a quantitative content analysis of 195 female characters appearing in twenty James Bond films.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Neuendorf |first1=Kimberly A. |last2=Gore |first2=Thomas D. |last3=Dalessandro |first3=Amy |last4=Janstova |first4=Patricie |last5=Snyder-Suhy |first5=Sharon |date=2010-06-01 |title=Shaken and Stirred: A Content Analysis of Women's Portrayals in James Bond Films |journal=Sex Roles |language=en |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=747–761 |doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9644-2 |s2cid=9372395 |issn=1573-2762 }}</ref>

The term ''Bond girl'' may also be considered as an anachronism, particularly in the post [[Me Too movement |#MeToo]] era, with regard to the objectification of women in film.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ford| first=Clementine |title=Are Bond girls sexist? |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/culture/story/20151014-bond-women-sexy-or-just-sexist|work=BBC Culture|date=October 14, 2015|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Child |first1=Ben |title=Time's up for James Bond: is 007 too toxic for the #MeToo era? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/times-up-for-james-bond-is-007-too-brutish-for-the-me-too-era |work=The Guardian |date=30 January 2018}}</ref>
