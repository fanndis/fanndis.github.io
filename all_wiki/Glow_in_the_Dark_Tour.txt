==Tour controversies==
[[File:Rihannagidt.jpg|150px|thumb|Rihanna on the tour]]

===Sacramento/Seattle mix-up===
A brief controversy emerged when during his performance in [[Sacramento]], West accidentally referred to the city as [[Seattle]], the latter of which he performed in only two days prior. West quickly admitted his mistake and made an apology to fans on his official blog.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kanyeuniversecity.com/blog/index.php?em3106=193412_-1__0_~0_-1_4_2008_0_0&em3161=&em3281= |title=Kanye West |publisher=Kanyeuniversecity.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611175909/http://www.kanyeuniversecity.com/blog/index.php?em3106=193412_-1__0_~0_-1_4_2008_0_0&em3161=&em3281= |archive-date=2008-06-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Bonnaroo controversy===
West's scheduled time at the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] was changed from 8:00 pm to 2:45 am to accommodate the light show for the Glow in the Dark Tour. This marked the first ever late night show on the big "What Stage" in Bonnaroo's 7-year history.<ref name="Kanye Late Night Set">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-18|url=http://bonnaroo.com/news/2008/06/09/kanye-west-late-night-set.aspx|title=Kanye West Late Night Set!|publisher=[[Bonnaroo]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623044226/http://www.bonnaroo.com/news/2008/06/09/kanye-west-late-night-set.aspx|archive-date=2008-06-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Pearl Jam]] ended up playing 50 mins over their allotted time, leaving less time for the setup of West's stage props for the Glow in the Dark Tour. A message on the monitors stated that the show would start at 3:30. When that didn't happen, the crowd grew restless and started chanting "Kanye Sucks". Once West came out on stage at 4:25 am most people quieted down. The delay was reportedly due to complications in the set up of West's elaborate ''glow in the dark'' concept concert after the [[Pearl Jam]] set. [[Graffiti]] was found throughout the festival ranging from "Fuck Kanye"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-a-kanye-west-tour-glow-in-the-dark-photos-backstage-tales-20091021 |title=Inside a Kanye West Tour: "Glow in the Dark" Photos, Backstage Tales |publisher=RollingStone.com |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2015-09-18}}</ref> to "[[Jay-Z]] Would Have Been on Time". West later wrote an outraged post on his blog, expressing his anger at the crowd's response and at Superfly's mismanagement.<ref name="Kanye Angers Bonnaroo Crowd">{{cite news|accessdate=2008-06-18 |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h3y4eDhzqIU49QpZGtV6hSWD05ygD91APRU03 |title=Delayed Kanye West gig angers Bonnaroo crowd |agency=Associated Press |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619192018/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h3y4eDhzqIU49QpZGtV6hSWD05ygD91APRU03 |archivedate=June 19, 2008 }}</ref>
