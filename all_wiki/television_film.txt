A '''television film''' is a [[feature film|feature-length]] motion picture that is produced and originally distributed by or to a television network, in contrast to theatrical films made explicitly for initial showing in movie theaters.

<!-- ALL OF THESE NEED TO BE SOURCED, NO MATTER HOW "COMMON" THE USAGE -->Such a production has also been called a '''TV movie''', '''TV film''', '''television movie''', '''telefilm''', '''telemovie/tele-movie''', '''motion picture made for television''', '''made-for-television movie''', '''made-for-television film''', '''direct-to-TV movie''', '''direct-to-TV film''', '''movie of the week''', '''feature-length drama''', '''single drama''', '''FTV''', and '''original movie'''.

== Origins and history ==
Precursors of "television movies" include ''Talk Faster, Mister'', which aired on WABD (now [[WNYW]]) in New York City on December 18, 1944, and was produced by [[RKO Pictures]],<ref name="Encyclo" /> and the 1957 ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'', based on the poem by [[Robert Browning]], and starring [[Van Johnson]], one of the first filmed "family musicals" made directly for [[television]]. That film was made in [[Technicolor]], a first for television, which ordinarily used color processes originated by specific networks. Most "family musicals" of the time, such as ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', were not filmed but broadcast live and preserved on [[kinescope]], a recording of a television program made by filming the picture from a video monitor â€“ and the only (relatively inexpensive) method of recording a television program until the invention of [[videotape]].

Many television networks were hostile toward film programming, fearing that it would loosen the network's arrangements with [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] and [[network affiliate|affiliates]] by encouraging [[television station|station]] managers to make independent deals with advertisers and [[film producer]]s.<ref name="Fifties Television 1992" />

Conversely, beginning in the 1950s episodes of American television series would be placed together and released as [[feature film]]s in overseas cinemas.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

[[Television network]]s were in control of the most valuable [[prime time]] slots available for programming, so [[broadcast syndication|syndicators]] of independent television films had to settle for fewer [[media market|television markets]] and less desirable time periods. This meant much smaller advertising revenues and license fees compared with network-supplied programming.<ref name="Fifties Television 1992" />

The term "made-for-TV movie" was coined in the [[United States]] in the early 1960s as an incentive for movie [[audience]]s to stay home and watch what was promoted as the equivalent of a [[First run (film)|first-run]] theatrical film. Beginning in 1961 with ''[[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]]'', a [[prime time]] network showing of a television premiere of a major theatrical film release, the other networks soon copied the format, with each of the networks having several ''[Day of the Week] Night At The Movies'' showcases which led to a shortage of [[movie studio]] product. The first of these made-for-TV movies is generally acknowledged to be ''[[See How They Run (1964 film)|See How They Run]]'', which debuted on [[NBC]] on October 7, 1964.<ref name="ABCMOW" /> A previous film, ''[[The Killers (1964 film)|The Killers]]'', starring [[Lee Marvin]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], was filmed as a TV-movie, although NBC decided it was too violent for television and it was released theatrically instead.<ref>[http://www.combustiblecelluloid.com/classic/killersr.shtml Combustible Celluloid.com, "Hemingway-esque", review by Jeffrey M. Anderson, paragraph 3]</ref>

The second film to be considered a television movie, [[Don Siegel]]'s ''[[The Hanged Man (1964 film)|The Hanged Man]]'', was broadcast by [[NBC]] on November 18, 1964.<ref name="ABCMOW" />

These features originally filled a 90-minute programming time slot (including [[television commercial|commercials]]), later expanded to two hours, and were usually broadcast as a weekly [[anthology series|anthology]] [[television series]] (for example, the ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]''). Many early television movies featured major stars, and some were accorded higher budgets than standard television series of the same length, including the major dramatic anthology programs which they came to replace.

In 1996, 264 made-for-TV movies were made by five of the six largest American television networks at the time (CBS, NBC, Fox, ABC, and [[UPN]]), averaging a 7.5 rating.<ref name="lifetime" /> By 2000, only 146 TV movies were made by those five networks, averaging a 5.4 rating.<ref name="lifetime" /> while the number of made-for-cable movies made annually in the U.S. doubled between 1990 and 2000.<ref name="lifetime" />

In several respects, television films resemble [[B movie]]s, the low-budget films issued by major studies from the 1930s through the 1950s for short-term showings in movie theaters, usually as a  double bill alongside a major studio release.  Like made-for-TV movies, B movies were designed as a disposable product, had low production costs and featured second-tier actors.<ref>[https://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/filmgenres/bmovies Film Genres, Dartmouth University]</ref>

== Examples ==
[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Saga of a Star World|Battlestar Galactica: Saga of a Star World]]'' premiered to an audience of over 60 million people on September 17, 1978.

Possibly the most-watched television movie of all time was [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Day After]]'', which premiered on November 20, 1983, to an estimated audience of 100 million people.<ref name="WotW" /> The film depicted America after a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] with the [[Soviet Union]], and was the subject of much controversy and discussion at the time of its release due to its graphic nature and subject matter.

Another popular and critically acclaimed television movie was 1971's ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'', written by [[Richard Matheson]], directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and starring [[Dennis Weaver]]. Such was the quality and popularity of ''Duel'' that it was released to cinemas in [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], and had a limited theatrical release to some venues in the United States and Canada. The 1971 made-for-TV movie ''[[Brian's Song]]'' was also briefly released to theatres after its success on television, and was even [[remake|remade]] in 2001. In some instances, television movies of the period had more explicit content included in the versions prepared to be exhibited theatrically in Europe. Examples of this include ''[[The Legend of Lizzie Borden]]'', ''[[Helter Skelter (1976 film)|Helter Skelter]]'', ''[[Prince of Bel Air]]'' and ''[[Spectre (1977 film)|Spectre]]''.

Many television movies released in the 1970s were a source of controversy, such as [[Linda Blair]]'s 1974 film ''[[Born Innocent (film)|Born Innocent]]'' and 1975's ''[[Sarah T. - Portrait of a Teenage Alcoholic]]'', as well as 1976's ''[[Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway]]'' and its 1977 [[sequel]], ''[[Alexander: The Other Side of Dawn]]'', which were vehicles for former ''[[The Brady Bunch|Brady Bunch]]'' actress [[Eve Plumb]]. Another significant film was [[Elizabeth Montgomery]]'s portrayal of a rape victim in the drama ''[[A Case of Rape]]'' (1974).

''[[My Sweet Charlie]]'' (1970) with [[Patty Duke]] and [[Al Freeman, Jr.]] dealt with racial prejudice, and ''[[That Certain Summer]]'' (1972), starring [[Hal Holbrook]] and [[Martin Sheen]], although controversial, was considered the first television movie to approach the subject of [[homosexuality]] in a non-threatening manner. ''[[If These Walls Could Talk]]'', a film which deals with [[abortion]] in three different decades (the 1950s, the 1970s and the 1990s) became a huge success, and was [[HBO]]'s highest rated film on record.

If a network orders a two-hour [[television pilot]] for a proposed show, it will usually broadcast it as a television movie to recoup some of the costs even if the network chooses to not order the show to series.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pulp Nonfiction |work=Entertainment Weekly |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302832,00.html |accessdate=December 6, 2008 |first=Albert |last=Kim |date=July 8, 1994}}</ref> Often a successful series may spawn a television movie [[sequel]] after ending its run. For example, ''[[Babylon 5: The Gathering]]'' launched the [[science fiction]] series ''[[Babylon 5]]'' and is considered to be distinct from the show's regular run of one-hour episodes. ''Babylon 5'' also has several made-for-TV movie sequels set within the same fictional continuity. The 2003 remake of ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' began as a two-part [[miniseries]] that later continued as a weekly television program. Another example is the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] movie ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (film)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'', which launched the [[sitcom]] of the same name that originally aired on ABC, and used the same actress ([[Melissa Joan Hart]]) for the lead role in both. The term "TV movie" is also frequently used as vehicles for "reunions" of long-departed series, as in ''[[Return to Mayberry]]'' and ''[[A Very Brady Christmas]]''. They can also be a spin-off from a TV series including ''[[The Incredible Hulk Returns]]'', ''[[The Trial of the Incredible Hulk]]'' and ''[[The Death of the Incredible Hulk]]''.

Occasionally, television movies are used as sequels to successful theatrical films. For example, only the [[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|first film]] in [[The Parent Trap series|''The Parent Trap'' series]] was released theatrically. ''[[The Parent Trap II]]'', ''[[Parent Trap III|III]]'' and ''[[Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon|Hawaiian Honeymoon]]'' were produced for television, and similarly, the [[Midnight Run#Sequels|''Midnight Run'' sequels]] have all been released as made-for-TV movies despite [[Midnight Run|the first]] having a strong run in theaters. These types of films may be, and more commonly are, released [[direct-to-video]]; there have been some films, such as ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning]]'' (a prequel to the film version of ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'') and ''[[James A. Michener's Texas]]'', which have been released near simultaneously on DVD and on television, but have never been released in theatres.

Made-for-TV movie musicals have also become popular. One prime example is the [[High School Musical (film series)|''High School Musical'' series]], which aired its first two films on the [[Disney Channel]]. The first television movie was so successful that a sequel was produced, ''[[High School Musical 2]]'', that debuted in August 2007 to 17.2 million viewers (this made it the highest-rated non-sports program in the history of basic cable and the highest-rated made-for-cable movie premiere on record).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117970479.html?categoryid=14&cs=1 |title='High School Musical 2' huge hit |accessdate=2007-08-18 |work= Variety| first1=Rick | last1=Kissell | first2=Michael | last2=Schneider | date=August 18, 2007}}</ref> Due to the popularity of the first two films, the second ''HSM'' sequel, ''[[High School Musical 3: Senior Year]]'', was released as a theatrical film in 2008 instead of airing on Disney Channel; ''High School Musical 3'' became one of the highest-grossing movie musicals.

Television movies traditionally were often broadcast by the major networks during [[sweeps period|sweeps]] season. Such offerings now are very rare; as [[Ken Tucker]] noted while reviewing the [[Jesse Stone novels#Television adaptations|Jesse Stone]] [[CBS]] television movies, "broadcast networks arenâ€™t investing in made-for-TV movies anymore".<ref>[http://watching-tv.ew.com/2011/05/22/tom-selleck-jesse-stone/ Why do we like Tom Selleck so much?]</ref> The slack has been taken up by cable networks such as [[Hallmark Channel]], [[Syfy]], [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] and HBO, with productions such as ''[[Temple Grandin (film)|Temple Grandin]]'' and ''[[Recount (film)|Recount]]'', often utilizing top creative talent.

High-calibre limited programming which would have been formerly scheduled solely as a two-hour film or miniseries also has been re-adapted to the newer "limited series" format over a period of weeks (rather than the consecutive days usually defined by a miniseries) where a conclusion is assured; an example of such would be ''[[The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story]]'', and these are most often seen on cable networks and streaming services such as [[Netflix]].

== Production and quality ==
In a 1991 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article, television critic John J. O'Connor wrote that "few artifacts of popular culture invite more condescension than the made-for-television movie".<ref name="NYT" /> Network-made television movies in the United States have tended to be inexpensively-produced and perceived to be of low quality.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Stylistically, these films often resemble single episodes of dramatic television series. Often, television films are made to "cash in" on the interest centering on stories currently prominent in the news, as the films based on the "Long Island Lolita" scandal involving [[Joey Buttafuoco]] and [[Amy Fisher]] were in 1993.

The stories are written to reach periodic semi-[[cliffhanger]]s coinciding with the network-scheduled times for the insertion of [[commercials]], and are further managed to fill, but not exceed, the fixed running times allotted by the network to each movie "series". In the case of films made for cable channels, they may rely on common, repetitive tropes (Hallmark Channel, for example, is notorious for its formulaic holiday romances, while Lifetime movies are well known for their common use of [[damsel in distress]] storylines). The movies tend to rely on smaller casts, one such exception being those produced for [[pay television|premium cable]], such as ''[[Behind the Candelabra]]'' (which featured established film actors [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Matt Damon]] in the lead roles) and a limited range of scene settings and camera setups. Even Spielberg's ''Duel'', while having decent production values, features a very small cast (apart from Dennis Weaver, all other actors appearing in the film play smaller roles) and mostly outdoor shooting locations in the desert.

The movies typically employ smaller crews, and rarely feature expensive [[special effects]]. Although a film's expenses would be lessened by filming using [[video]], as the movies were contracted by television studios, these films were required to be shot on 35&nbsp;mm [[film]]. Various techniques are often employed to "pad" television movies with low budgets and underdeveloped scripts, such as [[music video]]-style montages, flashbacks, or repeated footage, and extended periods of dramatic [[slow motion]] footage. However, the less expensive digital 24p video format has made some quality improvements on the television movie market.

Part of the reason for the lower budgets comes from the lack of revenue streams from them; whereas a theatrical film can make money from ticket sales, re-releases and syndication to television stations, most television films lacked those revenue streams, and the films are seldom [[rerun]]. Raconteur [[Jean Shepherd]] produced several television films in the 1970s and 1980s before realizing that the proceeds from his first theatrical film, ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', far exceeded anything he had ever done in television.<ref name="Sharbutt" />

Nonetheless, notable exceptions exist of high production quality and well-known casts and crews that even earned awards, such as ''[[The Diamond Fleece]]'', a 1992 [[Canada|Canadian]] TV film directed by [[Al Waxman]] and starring [[Ben Cross]], [[Kate Nelligan]] and [[Brian Dennehy]]. It earned Nelligan the 1993 [[Gemini Award]] for "Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series".<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/humancargo/stars_nelligan.html Human Cargo], ''[[CBC Television|CBC.ca]]''. Accessed April 29, 2008.</ref>

== Movie-length episodes of television shows ==
Occasionally, a long-running television series is used as the basis for television movies that air during the show's run (as opposed to the above-mentioned "reunion specials"). Typically, such movies employ a filmed [[single-camera setup]] even if the television series is videotaped using a [[multiple-camera setup]], but are written to be easily broken up into individual 30- or 60-minute episodes for [[broadcast syndication|syndication]]. Many such movies relocate the cast of the show to an exotic overseas setting. However, although they may be advertised as movies, they are really simply extended episodes of television shows, such as the pilots and the finales of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. Most of these are made and shown during [[sweeps period]] in order to attract a large television audience and boost [[Nielsen ratings|viewership]] for a show.

[[Crossover (fiction)|Crossover]] episodes containing a number of episodes of the characters of individual series interacting with characters across different shows (as has been done with the ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI]]'', ''[[NCIS (franchise)|NCIS]]'' and ''[[Chicago (franchise)|Chicago]]'' franchises, along with between ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' and ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' and ''[[How to Get Away With Murder]]'', and ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' and ''[[The Practice]]'') also play as films, encouraging tune-in among all the series crossed over to effectively create a multiple-hour plot that plays as a film when watched as a whole.
