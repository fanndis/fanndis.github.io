The '''Second EDSA Revolution''', also known as '''EDSA II''' (pronounced as ''EDSA Two'' or ''EDSA Dos''), was a  political protest from January 17–20, 2001 that peacefully overthrew the government of [[Joseph Estrada]], the [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|thirteenth]] [[President of the Philippines]].<ref name="tarnished" >{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB980104460815218842|title=Estrada: A Tarnished Legacy|date=January 22, 2001|website=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> Estrada resigned and was succeeded by his [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]], [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], who was sworn into office by then-[[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] [[Hilario Davide Jr.]] at around noon on January 20, 2001, several hours before Estrada fled [[Malacañang Palace]]. EDSA is an [[acronym]] derived from [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]], the major thoroughfare connecting five cities in [[Metro Manila]], namely [[Pasay]], [[Makati]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[Quezon City]], and [[Caloocan]], with the revolution's epicenter at the [[EDSA Shrine]] church at the northern tip of [[Ortigas Center]], a business district.

Advocates described EDSA II as "popular", but critics view the uprising as a conspiracy among political and business elites, military top brass and Catholic Cardinal Jaime Sin.<ref>Bowring, Philip. [http://www.iht.com/articles/2001/01/22/edbow.t_3.php Filipino Democracy Needs Stronger Institutions]. ''International Herald Tribune'' website. 2001, January 22. Retrieved January 27, 2009. 
</ref> International reaction to the revolt was mixed, with some foreign nations including the United States immediately recognising the legitimacy of Arroyo's presidency, and foreign commentators describing it as "a defeat for [[due process of law]]", "mob rule", and a "''[[de facto]]'' [[coup d'etat|coup]]".<ref name="nytimes.com">Mydans, Seth.

''The New York Times''.</ref>

The only means of [[political legitimacy|legitimizing]] the event was the last-minute Supreme Court ruling that "the welfare of the people is the supreme law."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/89502/sc-people%C3%A3%C2%A2%C3%A2%E2%80%9A%C2%AC%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2s-welfare-supreme-law | title=SC: People's welfare is the supreme law | date=January 21, 2001 | access-date=February 18, 2013 |work=The Philippine Star}}</ref> But by then, the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] had already withdrawn support for the president, which some analysts called unconstitutional, and most foreign political analysts agreeing with this assessment. William Overholt, a [[Hong Kong]]-based political economist said that "It is either being called [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]] or mob rule as a cover for a well-planned coup, ... but either way, it's not democracy."<ref name="nytimes.com"/> Opinion was divided during EDSA II about whether [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] as the incumbent Vice President should be President if Joseph Estrada was ousted; many groups who participated in EDSA II expressly stated that they did not want Arroyo for president either, and some of them would later participate in [[EDSA III]]. The prevailing Constitution of the Philippines calls for the Vice President of the Philippines, Arroyo at the time, to act as interim president only when the sitting President dies, resigns, or becomes incapacitated, none of which occurred during EDSA II.

[[File:Joseph estrada 2000.jpg|thumb|left|Deposed president: [[Joseph Estrada]]]]
[[File:Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.jpg|thumb|left|Incoming president: [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]]]
On October 4, 2000, [[Ilocos Sur]] Governor [[Luis Singson|Luis "Chavit" Singson]], a longtime friend of President Joseph Estrada, went public with accusations that Estrada, his family and friends received millions of [[Philippine peso|pesos]] from operations of the illegal numbers game, ''[[jueteng]]''.<ref name="sc">{{cite web |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2001/mar2001/146710_15.htm |title=Estrada vs Desierto: 146710-15 : March 2, 2001 : J. Puno : En Banc |publisher=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] |date=March 2, 2001 |access-date=February 18, 2013}}</ref>

The exposé immediately ignited reactions of rage. The next day, [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Teofisto Guingona, Jr.]] delivered a fiery privilege speech accusing Estrada of receiving P220 million in jueteng money from Governor Singson from November 1998 to August 2000, as well as taking P70 million-worth of [[excise tax|excise tax money]] from cigarettes intended for Ilocos Sur. The privilege speech was referred by [[Senate President]] [[Franklin Drilon]], to the [[Blue Ribbon Committee]] and the [[Committee on Justice]] for joint investigation. Another committee in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] decided to investigate the exposé, while other House members spearheaded a move to impeach the president.<ref name="sc"/>

More calls for resignation came from [[Manila]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Archbishop]] [[Jaime Sin]], the [[Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines]], former Presidents [[Corazon Aquino]] and [[Fidel Ramos]], and [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] (who had resigned her cabinet position of Secretary of the [[Department of Social Welfare and Development]]). Cardinal Sin stated in a statement, "In the light of the scandals that besmirched the image of presidency, in the last two years, we stand by our conviction that he has lost the [[moral authority]] to govern."<ref>Amando Doronila, The Fall of Joseph Estrada, 2001, p. 83</ref> More resignations came from Estrada's cabinet and economic advisers, and other members of congress defected from his ruling party.<ref name="sc"/>

On November 13, 2000, the House of Representatives led by Speaker [[Manuel Villar]] transmitted the Articles of Impeachment, signed by 115 representatives, to the Senate. This caused shakeups in the leadership of both houses of congress.<ref name="sc"/> The impeachment trial was formally opened on November 20, with twenty-one senators taking their oaths as judges, and [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court Chief Justice]] [[Hilario Davide, Jr.]] presiding. The trial began on December 7.<ref name="sc"/>

The day-to-day trial was covered on live television and received the highest viewing rating, mostly by the broadcasting giant [[ABS-CBN]] at the time.<ref name="sc"/> Among the highlights of the trial was the testimony of Clarissa Ocampo, senior vice president of [[Equitable PCI Bank]], who testified that she was one foot away from Estrada when he signed the name "Jose Velarde" documents involving a P500 million investment agreement with their bank in February 2000.<ref name="sc"/>

==Timeline in EDSA 2==
On January 16, 2001, the [[impeachment]] [[trial]] of President Estrada moved to the investigation of an envelope containing crucial [[evidence]] that would allegedly prove acts of [[political corruption]] by Estrada. [[Senate of the Philippines|Senators]] allied with Estrada moved to block the evidence. The conflict between the senator-judges and the [[prosecution]] became deeper, but then-Senate Majority Floor Leader [[Francisco Tatad]] requested that the impeachment court have a vote on opening the second envelope. The vote resulted in 10 senators in favor of examining the evidence, and 11 senators in favor of suppressing it. The list of senators who voted for the second envelope are as follows:

After the vote, Sen. [[Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.]] resigned as Senate President and walked out of the impeachment proceedings together with the nine opposition senators and 11 prosecutors in the Estrada impeachment trial. The 11 administration senators who voted to block the opening of the second envelope remained in the Senate session hall together with members of the defense panel. The phrase "''Joe's Cohorts''" quickly surfaced as a [[mnemonic device]] for remembering their names (Joe's Cohorts: '''J'''aworski, '''O'''reta, '''E'''nrile, '''S'''antiago, '''C'''oseteng, '''O'''smeña, '''H'''onasan, '''O'''ple, '''R'''evilla, '''T'''atad, '''S'''otto).<ref>[http://www.apmforum.com/columns/orientseas26.htm Armageddon Averted: People Power 2001] (January 2001), [http://www.apmforum.com/ Asian Business Strategy and Street Intelligence Ezine].</ref> In February 2001, at the initiative of Senate President [[Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.]], the second envelope was opened before the local and foreign media. It contained the document that stated that Jaime Dichavez and not Estrada owned the "Jose Velarde" account.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-29648010_ITM | work=Asia Africa Intelligence Wire | title=Dichavez owned bank account, says Pimentel | date=May 31, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/erapplundertrial/story/127550/BIR-wants-Erap-to-pay-P29B-tax-Estrada-cries-harassment |title=Erap Plunder Trial - BIR wants Erap to pay P2.9B tax; Estrada cries harassment |work=GMA News|date=2008-10-16 |access-date=August 24, 2013}}</ref>

===Day 1: Wednesday, January 17, 2001===
All 11 prosecutors in the Estrada impeachment trial resigned. Sen. Tessie Aquino-Oreta, one of three senators who voted against opening the envelope (a "NO" vote), was seen on national television; most assumed that she was dancing joyfully as the opposition walked out. This further fuelled the growing anti-Erap sentiments of the crowd gathered at [[Our Lady of Peace Quasi-Parish|EDSA Shrine]], and she became the most vilified of the 11 senators. She was labelled a "prostitute" and a "concubine" of Erap for her dancing act, while Sen. Defensor-Santiago was also ridiculed by the crowd who branded her a "lunatic".

As he did in the EDSA I protests, Cardinal Jaime Sin called on the people to join the rally at the shrine. During the night, people began to gather in large numbers around the shrine.

===Day 2: Thursday, January 18, 2001===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:EDSA 2.jpg|left|thumb|Hundreds of thousands protesters choke the EDSA-Ortigas Ave. intersection calling for the resignation of President [[Joseph Estrada]].]] -->
The crowd continues to grow, bolstered by students from private schools and left-wing organizations. Activists from the group Bayan and Akbayan as well as lawyers of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and other bar associations joined in the thousands of protesters. A similar parallel anti-Estrada rally was held in [[Makati]], and at the shrine area, just as in 1986, stars and icons from the music industry entertained the vast crowds.

===Day 3: Friday, January 19, 2001===
The [[Philippine National Police]] and the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] withdraw their support for Estrada, joining the crowds at the EDSA Shrine.<ref name="rally to oust" >{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/20/johnaglionby1|title=Filipinos rally to oust the president|date=January 19, 2001|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

At 2:00 PM, Joseph Estrada appears on television for the first time since the beginning of the protests and maintains that he will not resign. He says he wants the impeachment trial to continue, stressing that only a guilty verdict will remove him from office.

At 6:15 PM, Estrada again appears on television, calling for a snap presidential election to be held concurrently with congressional and local elections on May 14, 2001. He adds that he will not run in this election.

===Day 4: Saturday, January 20, 2001===
At exactly 1:30 in the afternoon, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo takes her oath of office in the presence of the crowd at EDSA, becoming the 14th president of the Philippines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jan/21/philippines|title=Estrada to stand trial for plunder|date=January 20, 2001|website=The Guardian}}</ref> At the same time, however, a large anti-Estrada crowd had already gathered at the historic Mendiola Bridge, having left the shrine earlier in the day, only to face PNP personnel and the pro-Estrada supporters behind them, who had by now already attacked both the police and the anti-Estrada protesters and heckling them and even members of the press.

At 2:00 PM, Estrada releases a letter saying he had "strong and serious doubts about the legality and constitutionality of her proclamation as president".<ref>{{cite book|author=Dirk J. Barreveld|title=Philippine President Estada Impeached!: How the President of the World's 13th Most Populous Country Stumbles Over His Mistresses, a Chinese Conspiracy and the Garbage of His Capital|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K-vfMSL4h-kC|year=2001|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-18437-8|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=K–vfMSL4h–kC&pg=PA476 476]}}</ref> In that same letter, however, he says he would give up his office in order to allow for national reconciliation.

Later, Estrada and his family evacuate Malacañan Palace on boat along the [[Pasig River]]. They are smiling and waving to reporters and shaking hands with the remaining Cabinet members and palace employees. He was initially placed under [[house arrest]] in [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]], but was later transferred to his rest home in Sampaloc, a small village in [[Tanay, Rizal]].

== Aftermath ==
On the last day of protests on EDSA on January 20, 2001, Estrada resigned as president and his successor [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] was sworn into office by [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide Jr.|Hilario G.

==Criticism==
World reaction to the administration change was mixed. Though foreign nations, including the United States, immediately expressed recognition of the legitimacy of Arroyo's presidency, foreign commentators described the revolt as "a defeat for [[due process of law]]", "mob rule", and a "''de facto'' coup".<ref name="nytimes.com" />

On January 18, 2008, Joseph Estrada's [[Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino]] (PMP) caused full-page advertisement in [[Metro Manila]] newspapers, blaming EDSA 2 of having "inflicted a dent on Philippine democracy". It featured clippings questioned the constitutionality of the revolution. The published featured clippings were taken from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Straits Times]]'', ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Asia Times Online]]'', ''[[The Economist]]'', and ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''. Supreme Court justice Cecilia Muñoz Palma opined that EDSA 2 violated the [[1987 Constitution]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/76974/Eraps-PMP-questions-EDSA-2-constitutionality |title=GMA NEWS.TV, Erap's PMP questions EDSA 2 constitutionality |work=GMA News|date=January 18, 2008 |access-date=August 24, 2013}}</ref>

On February 2008 parts of the Catholic Church that played a vital role during EDSA II issued a sort of an apology. The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) president and Iloilo Archbishop Angel Lagdameo expressed disappointment in Mrs. Arroyo, saying that the event which has become known as EDSA II, installed a president who was reported in February 2008 by the Philippine newspaper ''The Daily Tribune'' as "... now being adjudged in surveys as the country's 'most corrupt' leader".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.net.ph/headlines/20080220hed1.html|title=Edsa II a mistake, says CBCP head|author=Ayen Infante|date=February 20, 2008|newspaper=The Daily Tribune|location=Philippines|access-date=June 18, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423112807/http://www.tribune.net.ph/headlines/20080220hed1.html|archive-date=April 23, 2008}}</ref>

On March 13, 2008, Joseph Estrada named [[Lucio Tan]], [[Jaime Sin]], [[Fidel Ramos]], [[Luis Singson]], and the Ayala and Lopez clans (who were both involved in water businesses) as co-conspirators of EDSA Revolution of 2001.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/84514/7-years-after-ouster-Erap-bares-5-conspirators |title=GMA NEWS.TV, 7 years after ouster, Erap bares 5 conspirators |work=GMA News|date=2008-03-12 |access-date=August 24, 2013}}</ref>
