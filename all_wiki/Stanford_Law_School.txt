'''Stanford Law School''' (also known as '''Stanford Law''' or '''SLS''') is the [[law school]] of [[Stanford University]], a private [[research university]] near [[Palo Alto, California]].

Stanford Law School employs more than 90 full-time and part-time faculty members and enrolls over 550 students who are working toward their [[Doctor of Jurisprudence]] (J.D.) degree. Stanford Law also confers four advanced legal degrees: a [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.), a [[Master of Studies in Law]] (M.S.L.), a Master of the Science of Law (J.S.M.), and a [[Doctor of Juridical Science|Doctor of the Science of Law]] (J.S.D.). Each fall, Stanford Law enrolls a J.D. class of approximately 180 students, giving Stanford the smallest student body of any law school ranked in the top fourteen ([[Law school rankings in the United States#Schools that rank in the top 14 .28aka .22T14.22.29|T14]]).

==History==
[[File:Stanford Law School June 2019.jpg|thumb|right|Stanford Law School building]]
Stanford first offered a curriculum in legal studies in 1893, when the university hired its first two law professors: former U.S. president [[Benjamin Harrison]] and [[Nathan Abbott]]. Abbott headed the new program and assembled a small faculty over the next few years. The law department primarily enrolled undergraduate majors at this time and included a large number of students who might not have been welcome at more traditional law schools at the time, including women and students of color, especially Hispanic, Chinese and Japanese students.<ref name=schoolhistory>{{cite web|title=History of Stanford Law School|url=https://www.law.stanford.edu/history|publisher=Stanford Law School|accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref>

In 1900, the department moved from its original location in Encina Hall to the northeast side of the Inner Quadrangle. These larger facilities included Stanford's first law library. Beginning to focus more on professional training, the school implemented its first three-year curriculum and became one of 27 charter members of the [[Association of American Law Schools]] (AALS).<ref>[http://www.aals.org/member-schools/#r-s "AALS Member Schools"]. The Association of American Law Schools. Retrieved 27 June 2015.</ref> In 1901, the school awarded its first professional degree, the [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.).<ref name=schoolhistory/>

Starting in 1908, the law department began its transition into an exclusively professional school when Stanford's Board of Trustees passed a resolution to officially change its name from Law Department to Law School. Eight years later, Frederic Campbell Woodward became the first dean of the law school, and in 1923, the law school received accreditation from the [[American Bar Association#Accreditation of law schools|American Bar Association]] (ABA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/aba_approved_law_schools/by_year_approved.html |title=ABA-Approved Law Schools by Year |work=ABA website |accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref> In 1924, Stanford's law program officially transitioned into a modern professional school when it began requiring a bachelor's degree for admission.<ref name=schoolhistory/>

The 1940s and 1950s brought considerable change to the law school. After [[World War II]] caused the law school's enrollment to drop to fewer than 30 students, the school quickly expanded once the war ended in 1945. A move to a new location in the Outer Quadrangle, as well as the 1948 opening of the law school dormitory Crothers Hall (the result of a donation by Stanford Law graduate [[George E. Crothers]]), allowed the school to grow, while the 1948 inaugural publication of the ''[[Stanford Law Review]]'' (helmed by future [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Warren Christopher]] '49) helped to augment the law school's national reputation. The decision that Stanford should remain a small law school with a very limited enrollment emerged during this period. For the third time in its history, the law school relocated in the 1970s, this time to its current location in the Crown Quadrangle.<ref name=schoolhistory/>

In the 1960s and 1970s, the law school aimed to diversify its student body. During this period, students established a large number of new and progressive student organizations, including the Women of Stanford Law, the Stanford Chicano Law Student Association, the Environmental Law Society, and the Stanford Public Interest Foundation. Additionally, in 1966, the school sought to academically diversify its student body by collaborating with the [[Stanford Business School]] to create its first joint-degree program.<ref name=schoolhistory/> A year earlier, in 1965, the law school enrolled its first black student, [[Sallyanne Payton]] '68, and in 1972, the school hired its first female law professor, [[Barbara Babcock]], and its first professor of color, William Gould. In 1968, Stanford appointed [[Thelton Henderson]], future judge of the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]], as the first assistant dean for minority admissions. Henderson expanded minority enrollment from a single student to approximately a fifth of the student body.<ref name=schoolhistory/> Stanford Law's commitment to diversity continues today, and ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' currently ranks Stanford Law as one of the ten best law schools for minority students.<ref name=PrincetonReview>[http://www.princetonreview.com/schools/1035888/law/stanford-university-school-law "Stanford University - School of Law"]. ''The Princeton Review''. Retrieved 27 June 2015.</ref>

Earning national recognition in the 1980s and 1990s, the law school embarked on innovating its curriculum. Stanford offered new courses focusing on law and technology, environmental law, intellectual property law, and international law, allowing students to specialize in emerging legal fields. In 1984, it launched its first clinical program, the East Palo Alto Community Law Project.<ref name=schoolhistory/> By the 21st century, a new focus on interdisciplinary education emerged. In 2009, it transitioned from a semester system to a quarter system to align itself with Stanford's other graduate schools.<ref>Prossnitz, Annie.

Retrieved 26 June 2015.</ref>  Stanford also   expanded its upper-level  offerings in international law, by adding new clinics, academic centers, and simulation courses, and   expanded its joint degree programs.<ref>[https://www.law.stanford.edu/news/pr/a-3d-jd-stanford-law-school-announces-new-model-for-legal-education "A '3D' JD"].

==Academics and admissions==
[[File:Sls clinic 763.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Clinics]]

Stanford Law School is known for its student-to-faculty ratio (7.3 to 1), one of the lowest{{Vague|date=November 2017}} in the country.<ref name=USNWR/> The first-year class of approximately 180 students is divided into six smaller sections of 30 students each.<ref>[http://www.law.stanford.edu/degrees/jd/ JD Program | Stanford Law School].
