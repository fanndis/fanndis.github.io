This is where she raised her two children, Michelle and Craig, and continued to live till she eventually moved to the White House with the Obamas. Michelle Obama, in her book Becoming, describes her mother's strong attachment to her Chicago home and her commitment to raising her children as a stay at home mother. Shields resumed work as an executive assistant at a bank when her daughter Michelle started high school.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|last=Obama, Michelle, 1964-|title=Becoming|date=2019|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1088930870|publisher=CNIB|isbn=978-0-221-02673-7|oclc=1088930870|access-date=2020-07-11}}</ref>

== Relationship with Michelle Obama ==
Obama describes her mother as forthright and honest, and speaks of her implacability and her silent support for Obama throughout her childhood and beyond.<ref name=":0" /> Shields used to take her daughter Michelle to the library long before she started school and used to sit beside her as she learned to read and write. Usually the kind of mother who expected her children to settle their own disputes, Shields was quick to see real distress and stepped in to help when needed. For example, when Michelle was in second grade and was distressed because of being devalued by a teacher, Shields advocated for her and was instrumental in getting her daughter better learning opportunities at school. Shields encouraged her children to communicate with her about all subjects by being available when needed and giving practical advice. She entertained Michelle's school friends when they visited and enabled her to make her own choices in important matters. <ref name=":0" />

== Obama campaign and life in the White House ==
While Michelle and Barack Obama campaigned for his candidacy as president in 2008, Robinson helped them by providing support to her granddaughters, [[Family of Barack Obama#Malia and Sasha Obama|Malia and Sasha Obama]].
