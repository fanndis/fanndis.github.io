'''Frank H. McCourt Jr.''' (born August 14, 1953) is an American businessman, chairman of McCourt LP, chairman and CEO of McCourt Global, and current owner of the [[Los Angeles Marathon]] and football club [[Olympique de Marseille]]. He was the owner and chairman of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and [[Dodger Stadium]] from 2004 to 2012.

In 2004, he purchased a controlling interest of the Dodgers from [[Fox Entertainment Group]], owned by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]]. Prior to purchasing the Dodgers and moving to Los Angeles, McCourt was a Boston [[real estate developer]], whose family resided in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]].

In 2013, he donated $100 million to establish the [[McCourt School of Public Policy]], the ninth school of [[Georgetown University]].

On August 29, 2016, [[Margarita Louis-Dreyfus]], who was the owner of the French [[Ligue 1]] club, [[Olympique de Marseille]] and the [[Marseille]] mayor, [[Jean-Claude Gaudin]], stated during a press conference with McCourt that McCourt had agreed to purchase Olympique de Marseille. The deal was completed in [[Paris]] on October 17, 2016.

==Early years and business background==
McCourt was born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. He was raised as a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-mccourt-marriage-20100824,0,2274237.story|title=A baseball love story veers off the base paths|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 23, 2010|accessdate=September 9, 2010|first=Carla|last=Hall}}</ref> and attended [[Georgetown University]], where he earned an economics degree in 1975.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/la/community/executives/fmccourt.html |title=Los Angeles Dodgers Executives |publisher=Losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com |date=January 29, 2004 |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}</ref> He met his future wife, [[Jamie McCourt|Jamie Luskin]], when they were both freshmen at Georgetown.  They married in 1979.<ref name="allbusiness1">{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/sports-recreation/sports-recreation-facilities-venues/11764612-1.html |title=Los Angeles Business Journal, January 5, 2009 |publisher=Allbusiness.com |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}</ref>  The McCourt family has a long association with real estate and construction in the Boston area.

In 1977, McCourt founded The McCourt Company, which specializes in the development of major commercial real estate projects, particularly parking lots.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

In the late 1970s McCourt acquired {{convert|24|acre|m2}} in South Boston from the bankrupt [[Penn Central]] railroad and developed the L-shaped property into parking lots.

The McCourt company headquarters moved to Los Angeles in 2004 in connection with the family relocating to Los Angeles. The McCourts owned a $16 million, {{convert|13000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} home in Brookline, Massachusetts, that was acquired by [[John W. Henry]], owner of the Boston Red Sox.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/10/01/for_sox_owner_henry_the_joy_comes_daily/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=For Sox owner Henry, the joy comes daily | first=Dan | last=Shaughnessy | date=October 1, 2008}}</ref>

==Failed Red Sox bid==
Before buying the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], McCourt made a bid to buy his hometown [[Boston Red Sox]]. If he had won the bid, he had planned to build a new stadium on the land he owned and used for parking lots on the [[South Boston, Boston|South Boston]] waterfront.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Cafardo |author-link=Nick Cafardo|title=McCourt Far from Blue |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/06/12/mccourt_far_from_blue?pg=full |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=June 12, 2005 |accessdate=August 25, 2007 }}</ref> Instead, the Red Sox were sold in 2002 to [[John W. Henry]], [[Tom Werner]] and Red Sox President [[Larry Lucchino]].

McCourt is not the first member of this family to own part or whole of a sports franchise. His grandfather was part-owner of the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kronenberg|first=Jerry|title=Bankruptcy filing reveals Manny Ramirez owed $21M|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/baseball/other_mlb/view.bg?articleid=1348386|publisher=Boston Herald|accessdate=June 28, 2011}}</ref>

==Los Angeles Dodgers==

===Purchase of the L.A. Dodgers===
After his failed bid to buy the Red Sox, he turned his attention to the Dodgers. In 2004, McCourt bought the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for US$430 million from [[NewsCorp]], [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s flagship enterprise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1719414 |title=Vote will be taken today |accessdate=August 25, 2007 |work=ESPN.com }}</ref> McCourt's purchase of the Dodgers was financed mostly by debt.

In 2004 McCourt's South Boston parking lot property was used as collateral for some of the financing to acquire the Dodgers from NewsCorp.  Later the South Boston property was turned over to NewsCorp in exchange for canceling acquisition debt.<ref name="allbusiness1"/>  NewsCorp received approximately $200 million when they re-sold the property to Morgan Stanley and Boston real estate investor John B. Hynes III in 2006.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2006/09/01/hynes_buys_waterfront/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Hynes, Morgan Stanley buy 23 acres of Boston waterfront | date=September 1, 2006 | first1=Thomas C. | last1=Palmer Jr}}</ref>

The Dodgers assets acquired by McCourt included significant real estate assets related to the stadium in Chavez Ravine, including stadium parking lot land. Plans were announced for new real estate developments at Dodger Stadium however those plans never came to fruition. One discussed plan was for a [[Proposed Los Angeles NFL stadiums|NFL stadium]] and ajacent retail complex. However after the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' reported the details of the plan, political pressure forced both the NFL and McCourt to deny that either party was aggressively pursuing the idea.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/18/sports/la-sp-dodgers-mccourt-sale-20120119 |title=Frank McCourt might keep Dodger Stadium parking lots |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 18, 2012 |first=Bill |last=Shaikin }}</ref>

To offset the purchase, McCourt raised ticket and concession prices every year.<ref>{{ cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/finance/lists/33/2005/LIR.jhtml?passListId=33&passYear=2005&passListType=Misc&uniqueId=338671&datatype=Misc |title=MLB Team Valuations |work=Forbes.com }}</ref> By April 2009 the team and its related assets, in which McCourt had invested heavily in improvements, had increased in value to $722 million according to ''[[Forbes]]''.

===Hiring and firing of Paul DePodesta===
In 2003 (under NewsCorp ownership) the Dodgers' record was 85 wins, 77 losses.  Shortly after purchasing the team, McCourt fired then General Manager [[Dan Evans (baseball)|Dan Evans]], replacing him with [[Paul DePodesta]]. DePodesta is featured (along with [[Billy Beane]]) in the book ''[[Moneyball]]'' as it discussed their [[sabermetric]]-based approach to using statistics to build the [[Oakland A's]].  In Los Angeles, DePodesta made a trade in the middle of the 2004 season that sent the Dodgers' starting catcher, [[Paul Lo Duca]], its set-up man, pitcher [[Guillermo Mota]], and outfielder [[Juan Encarnación]] to the [[Florida Marlins]] for the high [[on-base percentage]] first baseman [[Hee-Seop Choi]] and [[power pitcher]] [[Brad Penny]] and pitching prospect [[Bill Murphy (baseball)|Bill Murphy]], who was in turn flipped with [[Koyie Hill]] and [[Reggie Abercrombie]] to the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] for Gold Glove center fielder [[Steve Finley]] and catcher [[Brent Mayne]]. At the time, DePodesta said of Choi, "I think we've acquired one of the better offensive players in the league."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://articles.latimes.com/2004/aug/04/sports/sp-choi4 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | first=Bill | last=Shaikin | title=DePodesta Didn't Overlook Choi | date=August 4, 2004}}</ref>

Finley hit 13 HRs for the Dodgers in his two months with the team. Choi batted .161 with 0 HRs for the Dodgers after the trade, though he walked 11 times in 87 plate appearances. In the playoff loss to St. Louis that season, Penny did not play, Choi had one at bat (hitless) and Dodger catchers were 3-for-10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/2004_NLDS1.shtml |title=2004 League Division Series |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref>

In [[2004 Los Angeles Dodgers season|2004]], the Dodgers won the NL West with a record of 93-69, but lost in four games to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2004 National League Division Series|Divisional Series]]. In the offseason the Dodgers decided not to re-sign [[Adrián Beltré]] due to his high contract demands (Beltre finished second in the NL MVP voting and would later sign with Seattle for 5 years/$64 million).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1947751 |title=Beltre gets 5-year deal day after Sexson signs – MLB – ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=December 16, 2004 |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}</ref> DePodesta signed outfielder [[J.

However, the [[2005 Los Angeles Dodgers season|2005 season]], with a record of 71—91, was the Dodgers' second-worst record since moving to Los Angeles, due in part to players' injuries. That off-season, manager [[Jim Tracy (baseball)|Jim Tracy]] was fired. Soon after Tracy was fired, McCourt fired DePodesta and about a month later, hired [[Ned Colletti]] to replace him.

===Ned Colletti/Joe Torre era===
[[Ned Colletti]]'s first action as GM was the signing of the former Red Sox manager, [[Grady Little]]. Colletti then signed several veteran players such as [[Rafael Furcal]], [[Nomar Garciaparra]], [[Kenny Lofton]], and [[Bill Mueller]]. These players were among those who led the 2006 Dodgers to the NL Wild Card spot, with an 88–74 record. The Dodgers were swept by the [[New York Mets]] in the [[2006 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]]. In the winter of 2006–07 the team signed [[Juan Pierre]], [[Jason Schmidt]], and [[Luis Gonzalez (outfielder, born 1967)|Luis Gonzalez]].

In October 2007, Grady Little resigned and [[Joe Torre]] was hired as their new manager.  In 2008 with Torre, [[Ned Colletti]] signed [[Andruw Jones]], [[Hiroki Kuroda]], and [[Chan Ho Park]]. During the trade deadline the Dodgers acquired [[Manny Ramirez]] in a trade with the [[Boston Red Sox]].

In 2007 Dr. Charles Steinberg was hired as executive vice president, marketing and public relations, of the Dodgers after working with the Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles. In 2009, he was reported to be on his way out and was said to be allied with Jamie McCourt and had lost influence as she did, according to a report in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-mccourts15-2009oct15,0,213794.story?page=1 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | title=Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, wife Jamie separate | first1=Helene | last1=Elliott | first2=Bill | last2=Shaikin | date=October 15, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20071127&content_id=2312213&vkey=pr_la&fext=.jsp&c_id=la |title=Dodgers name Dr. Charles Steinberg Executive Vice President, Marketing and Public Relations |publisher=Losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com |date=November 27, 2007 |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}</ref>

===Dodgers' Dream Foundation===
In 2010, it was revealed that then [[California Attorney General]] [[Jerry Brown]] was opening an investigation into the Dodgers' charitable foundation, the Dodgers' Dream Foundation. According to tax returns, the charity's chief executive, Howard Sunkin, earned a salary of nearly $400,000 per year, almost a quarter of the foundation's entire budget.<ref name="NYT1">{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Katie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/01/sports/baseball/01dodgers.html |title=Practices of Dodgers' Charity Are Said to Be Under Scrutiny |publisher=newyorktimes.com |date= August 31, 2010|accessdate=March 29, 2011}}</ref> Sunkin is a close associate of McCourt and has worked with him during his divorce proceedings.<ref name="NYT2">{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Katie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/sports/baseball/09dodgers.html?pagewanted=1&_r=4&ref=sports |title=Questions Arise About Executive's Pay at Dodgers Charity |publisher=newyorktimes.com |date= July 8, 2010|accessdate=March 29, 2011}}</ref>  The courts eventually awarded the funds to be repaid, and McCourt personally repaid $100,000.<ref>[https://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/22/sports/la-sp-0623-dodgers-foundations-20110623 Dodgers owner Frank McCourt repaid funds to a team charity]</ref>

===Divorce proceedings===
On October 14, 2009, it was announced the McCourts would be separating after nearly 30 years of marriage.<ref name="yahoo1">{{cite web|last=Brown |first=Tim |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news;_ylt=Ag9YTtKMBerr1fn9sXCgcbU5nYcB?slug=ti-mccourts101409&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Dodgers owner separating from wife/team CEO – MLB – Yahoo! Sports |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}</ref> While speculation was raised on the impact upon the McCourt family and Dodger ownership, a spokesperson for [[Jamie McCourt]] said the following day that "the focus of the Dodgers is on the playoffs and the World Series." Jamie was fired from her position as Dodgers CEO on Thursday, October 22, 2009, the day after the Dodgers were eliminated from the playoffs.<ref name="yahoo1"/> She officially filed for divorce shortly thereafter. He has claimed that the divorce has "no bearing on the team whatsoever."<ref>{{cite web|author=Ken Gurnick |url=http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100114&content_id=7918308&vkey=news_la&fext=.jsp&c_id=la |title=McCourt: Divorce won't affect Dodgers &#124; dodgers.com: News |publisher=Losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com |date=January 14, 2010 |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}</ref>

On December 7, 2010, the judge in the divorce case of the McCourts invalidated the post-nuptial marital property agreement ("MPA") that Frank McCourt had claimed provided him with sole ownership of the Dodgers. In the wake of this decision, Frank McCourt's lawyers said that Frank would use other legal avenues to establish his sole ownership of the Dodgers, while Jamie McCourt's lawyers said that Jamie would be confirmed as the co-owner of the team as community property of their marriage.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-1208-dodgers-mccourt-jamie-20101208,0,5619981.story?page=1  "Dodgers in limbo after judge throws out McCourt property agreement"] L.A. Times, December 7, 2010, by Bill Shaikin and Carla Hall</ref>

On June 17, 2011, the McCourts reached agreement on a settlement of their divorce. The settlement was contingent upon Major League Baseball approving a 17-year television contract between the Dodgers and [[Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket]]. The discussion set aside the Dodgers' ownership issue until a scheduled one-day trial on August 4, whereupon if the judge sided with Frank he would keep the team and pay a settlement fee to Jamie and if the judge sided with her the team would be sold.<ref>[http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110617&content_id=20623800&vkey=news_la&c_id=la McCourts reach divorce settlement]</ref> However, on June 20, baseball rejected the television deal and the settlement agreement fell apart.<ref>[http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110620&content_id=20770860&vkey=news_la&c_id=la Commish: TV deal not in Dodgers' best interests]</ref>

On October 17, 2011, the McCourts reached a settlement in their divorce case whereby Jamie would receive about $130 million and relinquish her claim on the Dodgers. This ended what is widely believed to be the costliest divorce in California history.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-1017-mccourt-divorce-settlement-20111017,0,2826184.story Frank and Jamie McCourt reach settlement involving Dodgers]</ref>

===Ownership dispute with Major League Baseball: Bankruptcy and sale of the Dodgers===
{{Main|2011 Los Angeles Dodgers ownership dispute}}

In April 2011, MLB Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] announced that MLB would be appointing a representative to oversee the day-to-day operations of the Dodgers. His statement said that he took that action because of his "deep concerns for the finances and operations" of the Dodgers.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/mlb/news/story?id=6397488 Bud Selig says MLB will run Dodgers]</ref> This event occurred shortly after an ''LA Times'' report that McCourt had obtained a personal loan from [[Fox Entertainment Group|Fox]] to cover the team's payroll for April and May. McCourt vigorously disputed MLB's actions. Nevertheless, Selig appointed former diplomat and former Texas Rangers executive [[Tom Schieffer]] to oversee the Dodgers' finances. On June 27, the Dodgers filed for [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy]] protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/mlb/news/story?id=6708046 |title=Dodgers file for bankruptcy}}</ref>

After much legal wrangling between McCourt's lawyers and MLB lawyers in bankruptcy court, he reached a deal with the league to put the team up for sale.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/dodgers/2011/11/mccourt-agrees-to-sell-dodgers.html Frank McCourt agrees to sell Dodgers]</ref> On March 27, 2012, he agreed to sell the team to a group consisting of  former L.A. Laker [[Magic Johnson]], former baseball executive [[Stan Kasten]] and the [[Guggenheim Partners]] for a record price of $2 billion, the highest ever for a professional sports team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/mlb/story/_/id/7745566/los-angeles-dodgers-selling-team-magic-johnson-group|title=Dodgers sold to Magic Johnson group|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref> McCourt separately sold the land surrounding the stadium for $150 million to the same group, while maintaining some economic interest in the property. According to the Guggenheim Group, McCourt has control or influence over the land, but will profit from potential future development of it. Also, the new ownership pays $14 million to rent the parking lots surrounding Dodger Stadium from an entity half-owned by McCourt.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-0505-dodgers-land-20120505,0,2033775.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Bill | last=Shaikin | title=Dodgers' owners to pay $14 million a year to rent parking lots from McCourt entity | date=May 4, 2012}}</ref> The sale officially closed on May 1, 2012, ending McCourt's turbulent period as Dodgers owner.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgersnow/la-sp-dn-dodgers-sale-mccourt-magic-20120501,0,4128722.story Dodgers sale closes; McCourt era ends]</ref>

In 2008, McCourt bought the operating rights to the [[Los Angeles Marathon]].<ref>[http://news.runtowin.com/2008/09/26/frank-mccourt-buys-the-rights-to-the-la-marathon.html Frank McCourt buys the rights to the LA Marathon]</ref> McCourt's group changed the route of the Marathon so that it would start at Dodger Stadium.

==Global Champions Tour==
In 2014, McCourt bought 50% of the [[Global Champions Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/dodgersnow/la-sp-dn-frank-mccourt-horse-jumping-20140623-story.html|title=Frank McCourt buys into the elite with European horse-jumping tour|work=LATimes|first=Steve|last=Dilbeck|date=June 23, 2014}}</ref>

In 2017, Frank and Monica McCourt founded a showjumping team, the Miami Celtics. 

==Olympique de Marseille==
On August 29, 2016, McCourt entered exclusive negotiations to purchase the French [[Ligue 1]] club [[Olympique de Marseille]] from [[Margarita Louis-Dreyfus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/sports/soccer/frank-mccourt-marseille-france.html|title=Former Dodgers owner McCourt to buy French soccer team|work=New York Times|date=August 29, 2016}}</ref> The purchase deal was completed for a reported  price tag of €45 million on October 17, 2016. Within the next few days, he appointed [[Jacques-Henri Eyraud]] (a French businessman) as the club's president and [[Rudi Garcia]] as coach of the club's first team. He pledged to invest €200 million in the club over the next four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37685865|title=Marseille: Frank McCourt promises £180m investment after buying Ligue 1 club|publisher=BBC|date=October 17, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-mccort-marseille-rudi-garcia-20161021-snap-story.html|title=Former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt quickly makes moves after purchasing Marseille|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 21, 2016}}</ref>

For the first transfer window in the McCourt era in January 2017, Marseille reinforced the team with the purchase of [[Dimitri Payet]], [[Patrice Evra]], [[Morgan Sanson]] and [[Grégory Sertic]], for a total of around €45M.
