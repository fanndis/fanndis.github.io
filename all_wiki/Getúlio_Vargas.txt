'''Getúlio Dornelles Vargas''' ({{IPA-pt|ʒeˈtulju doʁˈnɛlis ˈvaʁɡɐs|lang}}; 19 April 1882 – 24 August 1954) was a Brazilian lawyer and politician, who served as [[President of Brazil|president]] during two periods: the first was from 1930 to 1945, when he served as interim president from 1930 to 1934, constitutional president from 1934 to 1937, and dictator from 1937 to 1945. After resigning in 1945, Vargas returned to power as the democratically elected president in 1951, serving until his suicide in 1954. Vargas led Brazil for 18 years, the longest of any president, and second in Brazilian history only to [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]] among heads of state. He favored [[Brazilian nationalism|nationalism]], [[industrialization]], [[centralization]], [[social welfare]] and [[populism]] – for the latter, Vargas won the nickname, "the father of the poor".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Poppino |first1=Rollie E. |title=Getúlio Vargas: President of Brazil |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Getulio-Vargas |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> Vargas is one of a number of populists who arose during the 1930s in Latin America, including [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] and [[Juan Perón]], who promoted nationalism and pursued social reform.<ref name="auto">{{cite book |first1=Benjamin |last1=Keen |first2=Keith |last2=Haynes |title=A History of Latin America |date=2004 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |isbn=0-618-31851-8 |pages=300–303, 329–334, 364–376 |edition=7th}}</ref> He was a proponent of workers' rights as well as a staunch [[anti-communist]].

Vargas was brought to power by political outsiders and the [[wikt:rank and file|rank-and-file]] of the [[Brazilian Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] in the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930|Revolution of 1930]]; this was a reaction to his loss in the [[1930 Brazilian general election|presidential election earlier that year]]. His ascent marked the end of the Brazilian [[República Velha|Old Republic]] and the São Paulo-Minas alliance-dominated [[Café com leite politics|coffee-with-milk politics]]. He successfully influenced the outcome of the [[1934 Brazilian presidential election|Brazilian presidential election of 1934]], and used fears of a Communist uprising to institute an authoritarian [[corporatist]] regime in 1937 known as the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|New State]], modeled on [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime 1922-1943|Mussolini's Italy]], [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Salazar's Portugal]] and [[Francoist Spain|Franco’s Spain]]. Vargas went on to appease and eventually dominate his supporters, and pushed his political agenda as he built a [[propaganda]] machine around his figure.

Vargas sought to transform Brazil from a plantation-based economy into an industrialized powerhouse, using government intervention. His embrace of [[developmentalism]] was expressed not only in strong rhetoric, but also by lending [[protectionism|protection]] to domestic industries and by devoting much state funding to investment aimed at kick-starting "strategic" sectors and setting up the necessary infrastructure. Vargas created state monopolies for oil ([[Petrobras]]), mining ([[Vale (mining company)|Vale]]), steelmaking ([[National Siderurgy Company]]), [[alkali]]s (National Alkalis Company) and automobiles ([[National Motors Factory]]). His policies shaped the Brazilian economic debate for decades, from the governments of [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] and leftist [[João Goulart]] to the right-wing [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|military dictatorship of 1964 to 1985]]. The protectionist trend was reversed by the 1990s with the liberal reforms of [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] and [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]].

With the global rise of democracy in the aftermath of [[World War II]], Vargas was forced to step down in 1945 and was succeeded by [[José Linhares]] the same year. Nevertheless, the economic growth that occurred under his administration made him a popular figure in Brazilian politics even after his resignation. His popularity awarded him a late presidential term in 1951, but growing political strife over his views and methods led to his [[suicide]] in 1954. He was the first president in the country to draw widespread support from [[Commoner|the masses]] and is regarded as the most influential Brazilian politician of the twentieth century.<ref>Hassan Arvin-Rad, Maria José Willumsen, [[Ann Dryden Witte]].

==Background==
[[File:Pais-de-Getúlio-Vargas.JPG|thumb|left|Getúlio Vargas' parents: Cândida and Manuel Vargas.]]

[[File:Getúlio&Darci.gif|thumb|left|Photographed with his wife [[Darci Vargas]] in 1911, during the period known as Brazilian ''[[Belle Époque]]''.]]

Vargas was born in [[São Borja, Rio Grande do Sul|São Borja]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], southern Brazil, on 19 April 1882, to Manuel do Nascimento Vargas and Cândida Dornelles Vargas. His father had origins in Azores and [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], being a descendant of early São Paulo families ("paulistas"): he was a descendant of [[Amador Bueno]], a noted paulista from the [[Colonial Brazil|colonial Brazilian era]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geneall.net/P/per_page.php?id=252025 |title=Getulio Vargas |accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref> His mother was descended from a wealthy family of [[Azores|Azorean]] [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] descent.<ref>KOIFMAN, Fábio. Presidentes Do Brasil: De Deodoro A Fhc.</ref>

The son of a traditional family of "[[Gaucho|gaúchos]]", he embarked on a military career. Vargas enlisted as a private in 1899 in the sixth infantry battalion and later joined the military college at Rio Pardo. Vargas then turned to law school at [[Porto Alegre]] in the Rio Grande, and while there he published a political newspaper, ''O Debate''. Vargas was the chosen orator in his graduating class of 1907 and was immediately appointed district attorney. In 1909 he opened his own law office in São Borja.<ref name="auto1">Lillian Fisher "Getulio Vargas, The Strong Man of Brazil" International Honors Society of Social Sciences Vol. 19 No. 2 Pg. 80–86 April, 1944</ref> Entering Republican politics, he was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Rio Grande do Sul]] and later to the federal [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] in 1922, where he became the floor leader for his state's delegation in Congress. He served as [[Ministry of the Economy (Brazil)|Minister of Finance]] from 1926 to 1928 under President [[Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa|Washington Luís]], from which post he resigned to enter the gubernatorial race in his home state. Once elected Governor of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], he became a leading figure in the national opposition, urging the end of electoral corruption through the adoption of the universal and secret ballot. As Governor of [[Rio Grande do Sul]] he distinguished himself as an excellent administrator. During his term as governor he reorganized the agricultural system. He established a state [[mortgage]] and agricultural bank. He also created the department of agriculture in his state. Vargas also worked hard to improve schools and infrastructure during his term as governor.<ref name="auto1"/>

He and his wife [[Darci Vargas|Darci Lima Sarmanho]], whom he married in March 1911, had five children: Lutero, Alzira, Jandira, Manuel e Getulinho. According to legend, Vargas' real love was not his wife, but Aimee de Sa Sottomaior,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whitepages.com.br/history |title=From the invention of the Phone to the Internet White Pages |accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref> later [[Aimée de Heeren]], recognized by the international fashion press as one of the world's most glamorous and beautiful women. The relationship was a Brazilian state secret, although Vargas did mention her in a diary published after the death of his wife. Aimee de Herren, later living between France and the [[United States]] and admired by other famous statesmen such as the Kennedy brothers, never confirmed nor denied the rumor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aimeedeheeren.com |title=Aimee de Heeren.com – one of the most glamorous Woman of the 20th century }}</ref>

Although he would later involve the [[Catholic Church]] closely with the state, Vargas was firmly agnostic.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-review-of-social-history/article/world-war-ii-and-brazilian-workers-populism-at-the-intersections-between-national-and-global-histories/BFCED0F82F4518248FA9B25EDE4289E3/core-reader# |title=World War II and Brazilian Workers: Populism at the Intersections between National and Global Histories |first=Alexandre |last=Fortes |journal=International Review of Social History |year=2017 |volume=62 |issue=S25 |pages=165–190 |via=Cambridge Core |doi=10.1017/S0020859017000608 |quote=It should not be forgotten that Getúlio Vargas was an avowed agnostic, who named his first son with the decidedly un-Catholic name Lutero and, moreover, for whom one of the main achievements of his trabalhista politics was to avoid the formation of a confessional form of unionism in a country deeply shaped by Catholicism. That does not mean that religion was absent from politics during varguismo: As an older but very nuanced analysis of the role of religiosity during varguismo has demonstrated, the process of the construction of a popular base of Vargas supporters involved the channeling of popular religious feelings toward the state, by way of the development of a form of civic ritualism and a cult of the figure of the dictator.|doi-access=free }}</ref>

[[File:Washington-Luiz-e-Ministério-1926.jpg|thumb|left|[[Washington Luís]] and his cabinet, 1926. Vargas can be seen as the first, from left to right, on the second row.]]

Between the two World Wars, Brazil was a rapidly industrializing nation{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} popularly regarded as "the sleeping giant of the Americas" and a potential [[Great power|world power]]. However, the oligarchic and decentralized confederation of the [[First Brazilian Republic|Old Republic]], dominated by [[Fazenda|landed interests]], in effect showed little concern for promoting [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], and other broad interests of the new middle class. The coffee planters of São Paulo, in particular, were content with exporting their product abroad while relying on foreign investment to build the economy.<ref name="auto2">{{cite book|last1=Benajmin|first1=Keen|last2=Keith|first2=Haynes|title=A History of Latin America|date=2004|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|isbn=0-618-31851-8|pages=364–376|edition=Seventh}}</ref> In addition, they feared reforms that might lead to radical social change. Through the agreements of [[Café com leite politics|café com leite]], São Paulo and their junior partner, [[Minas Gerais]], rotated the presidency and dominated national politics, securing political stability and the economic success of the upper classes. However, resentment had grown among the middle class, who shared the landowners' fears of radical social change, but who wanted to invest in industrialization and restrict foreign investment.<ref name="auto2"/>

In 1926, Washington Luis, a native of Macaé a city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] but ran for [[São Paulo]], was elected president. His election had been assisted by the [[political machine]] of [[Borges de Medeiros]], and so he nominated one of that machine's members, Getulio Vargas, to be his Finance Secretary. Although Vargas was only to serve two years as Finance Secretary before returning to Rio Grande do Sul to become governor, he gained valuable recognition and experience on the national level.<ref name="auto3">{{cite web|last1=Watkins|first1=Thayer|title=Getulio Vargas and the Estado Novo|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/vargas.htm|publisher=San José State University Department of Economics|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref>

==First presidency==

===Vargas and the Revolution of 1930===
{{main|Revolution of 1930}}

[[File:Revolução de 1930.jpg|thumb|right|Getúlio Vargas with other leaders of the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930|Revolution of 1930]] in [[Itararé]], shortly after the overthrow of President [[Washington Luís]].]]

The [[Great Depression in Latin America|Great Depression]] set off the tensions that had been building in Brazilian society for some time, spurring revolutionary leaders to action.

The elections of 1930 pitted [[Júlio Prestes]] of the establishment, São Paulo-faction, against Vargas, who led a broad coalition of middle-class industrialists, planters from outside São Paulo, and the reformist faction of the military known as the ''[[Tenente revolts|tenentes]]''.<ref name="auto2"/> The middle class resented free market and [[Café com leite politics|café com leite]] policies that let foreign companies out-compete them and restricted industrialization.<ref name="auto2"/> The non-São Paulo landowners feared radical change and had no desire for the economic nationalism advocated by the bourgeoisie, but did want to end the dominance of São Paulo.<ref name="auto2"/> The ''tenentes'' had been led through the Brazilian countryside by [[Luis Carlos Prestes]] to rally support for a military coup, and though they failed to find support, they had become exposed to rural poverty and now favored social reform.<ref name="auto2"/>

Together, these disparate groups made up the [[Liberalism in Brazil#Liberal Alliance|Liberal Alliance]]. Support was especially strong in the provinces of [[Minas Gerais]], [[Paraíba]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]], because in nominating another Paulista to succeed himself, Washington Luis had violated the traditional alteration between Minas Gerais and São Paulo.<ref name="auto3"/> Vargas campaigned carefully, needing to please a large range of supporters. He used populist rhetoric and promoted bourgeois concerns. He opposed the primacy of São Paulo, but did not challenge the planters' legitimacy and kept his calls for social reform moderate. The election itself was plagued by [[Coronelism|corruption]] and denounced by both sides, and when it had become clear that the São Paulo candidate, Júlio Prestes, had won the election, tensions were high. When the vice-presidential candidate of the Liberal Alliance was assassinated, the military decided to initiate a bloodless coup. On October 24, 1930, they ousted President [[Washington Luís Pereira de Sousa|Washington Luís]] and the president-elect [[Júlio Prestes]], installing Vargas as 'interim president'.<ref name="auto2"/>

===Provisorial Presidency (1930-1934)===

[[File:Getúlio Vargas com Ministros - 1931.jpg|thumb|Vargas and his cabinet in 1931.]]

Vargas was a wealthy pro-industrial nationalist and anti-communist who favoured corporatism. Although he had been careful not to offend the landowners during the campaign, he did advocate moderate social reform and economic nationalism.<ref name="auto"/> He began by addressing the crisis in the coffee industry, which was suffering from low prices due to the Great Depression. Vargas implemented the traditional solution of [[Coffee production in Brazil#History|valorization]], in which the state bought up extra coffee supplies. In addition, Vargas promoted the diversification of agriculture, especially with cotton.<ref name="auto"/>

Like [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]] in the U.S., Vargas employed economic stimulus. A state interventionist policy utilizing tax breaks, lowered duties, and import quotas<ref name="auto4">{{cite book|last1=Benajmin|first1=Keen|last2=Keith|first2=Haynes|title=A History of Latin America|date=2004|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|isbn=0-618-31851-8|pages=370–171|edition=Seventh}}</ref> allowed Vargas to expand the domestic industrial base. Vargas linked his pro-industrial policies to nationalism, advocating heavy tariffs<ref name="auto2"/> to "protect our manufacturers to the point where it will become unpatriotic to feed or clothe ourselves with imported goods." Vargas quelled a female workers' strike in São Paulo by co-opting much of their platform but requiring their "factory commissions" to use government mediation in the future.<ref name="auto4"/> Vargas, reflecting the influence of the ''tenentes'', even advocated a program of social welfare and reform similar to the [[New Deal]]. One of Vargas' first acts in a pattern of [[Populism|Populist]] gestures was the promotion of [[Pedro Ernesto Baptista]]'s candidacy for mayor of [[Rio de Janeiro]]. He also introduced voting reforms for the election of the constituent assembly that would draft the 1934 constitution, including a secret ballot, votes for women, and a voting age of eighteen instead of twenty-one.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Benajmin|first1=Keen|last2=Keith|first2=Haynes|title=A History of Latin America|date=2004|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|isbn=0-618-31851-8|pages=372|edition=Seventh}}</ref>

Opposition to Vargas was radicalised in  [[1932 Constitutionalist Revolution|the 1932 movement]] that was aimed at the restoration of democracy and the establishment of a new constitution. The revolt was beaten back, but a new constitution was written in 1934. After that, Vargas seized absolute power and controlled dissidents through press and mail censorship. His tenuous coalition also lacked a coherent program, being committed to a broad vision of modernization, but little more specific. Vargas, especially during his early years, was always in danger of being ousted by one or more of the groups in his coalition, including the anti-São Paulo planters, the bourgeoisie, and the military.<ref name="auto2"/>

===Constitutional Presidency (1934-1937)===
[[File:Getúlio Vargas (pintura).jpg|thumb|180px|Painting of Vargas]]
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2020}}
The parallels between Vargas and the European [[police state]]s began to appear by 1934, when a new constitution was enacted with some direct almost-fascist influences.

Brazil's 1934 constitution, passed on 16 July, contained provisions that resembled Italian and Spanish corporatism, which had the enthusiastic support of the pro-fascist wing of the disparate ''tenente'' movement and industrialists, who were attracted to Mussolini's co-optation of unions through state-run, sham syndicates. As in Italy, and later [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], Fascist-style programs would serve two important aims, stimulating industrial growth and suppressing the communist influence in the country. Its stated purpose, however, was uniting all classes in mutual interests. The constitution established a new Chamber of Deputies that placed government authority over the private economy, which established a system of state-guided capitalism aimed at industrialization and reducing foreign dependency. "Progressive nationalization" would be used to bring natural resources under state control, and the government would have the right to set minimum wages, mediate in strikes, and enact labor legislation. Nonetheless, a significant amount of political power was still preserved for the states and the federalism of the Old Republic continued.

After 1934, the regime designated corporate representatives according to class and profession, but maintained private ownership of Brazilian-owned business. Based on increased labor rights and social investment, Brazilian corporatism was actually a strategy to increase industrial output utilizing a strong nationalist appeal. Vargas, and later [[Juan Perón]] in neighboring [[Argentina]], emulated some of Mussolini's strategy of mediating class disputes and co-opting workers' demands under the banner of nationalism. Under the increase of workers' rights also, Vargas greatly expanded labor regulations with the consent of industry, pacified by strong industrial growth. The working day was set at eight hours in commerce and industry, minimum wages were established nationwide, and benefits programs such as pensions and paid vacations were guaranteed.

Despite the material gains of labor, Vargas began slowly shifting to the right. Reforms were not extended to cover the 85% of workers in the agricultural sector, and little effort was made even to enforce the minimum wage in rural areas. Meanwhile, the president came into increasing conflict with Luis Carlos Prestes, the former leader of the tenentes who was now in charge of the [[Brazilian Communist Party#Reorganization and growth|Brazilian Communist Party]]. Prestes was also in charge of the National Liberation Alliance (ANL), which was banned in 1935 after Prestes criticized Vargas. A rebellion of the ANL and Communists in 1935 gave Vargas the excuse he needed to consolidate his power.

== The New State (1937-1945) ==
{{main|Estado Novo (Brazil)}}

[[File:Propaganda do Estado Novo (Brasil).jpg|thumb|Propaganda of the New State.]]

Vargas faced having to step down as president in 1938 because his own 1934 constitution prohibited the president from succeeding himself. On 29 September 1937, Gen. Dutra, his rightist collaborator, revealed "the Cohen Plan", which detailed a plan for a Communist revolution. He publicly demanded that the government declare a [[State of emergency|state of siege]]. On 10 November 1937, Vargas announced in a nationwide [[radio]] address that he was seizing emergency powers.  He also dissolved Congress and canceled the elections due for January 1938.  On the same night, the constitution was recast into a severely authoritarian document that concentrated virtually all power in Vargas' hands.  The regime created by this document is known as the ''[[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]]'' (New State).  The short interval strongly suggests that the [[self-coup]] had been planned well in advance.

Under the Estado Novo, Vargas abolished [[political party|political parties]], imposed [[censorship]], established a centralized police force, and filled prisons with political dissidents, while evoking a sense of nationalism that transcended class and bound the masses to the state. He ended up repressing his erstwhile supporters, the "[[Brazilian Integralism|Integralists]]," as well, once the communists were already defeated.  The Integralists wished for a total fascist dictatorship{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}, which was more than he desired.

During the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] Vargas made major changes to the Brazilian economy for the betterment of Brazil. But also with help and pressure from the United States, because of the [[second World War]]. Vargas began to prioritize the middle class and provided for higher education and better job opportunities. Vargas also began to focus on industrialization; this led to the creation of the first steel mill in Brazil at [[Volta Redonda]]. To help further modernize and industrialize Brazil Vargas nationalized oil production and refinement. To improve the life of the laborer Vargas implemented the forty hour work week, a minimum wage, and other regulations to protect middle class and poorer workers.<ref>{{cite book | title=The New Brazil | publisher=Brookings Institution Press | author=Roett, Riordan | year=2011 | pages=42–43}}</ref>

The 1937 Constitution provided for elections to a new Congress, as well as a referendum to confirm Vargas' actions.  However, neither were held – ostensibly due to the dangerous international situation. Instead, under an article of the Constitution that was supposed to be transitional pending new elections, Vargas assumed legislative as well as executive powers. Also, under the 1937 Constitution Vargas should have remained president for only six more years (until November 1943), but instead stayed in office until 1945. For all intents and purposes, Vargas ruled for eight years under what amounted to [[martial law]].

===Vargas and the Axis Powers===

The repressions that followed the communist [[coup d'état]] attempt in Brazil in November 1935 increased the cooperation between Brazil and Germany.  After Brazil deported the revolutionary Jewish German [[Olga Benário Prestes]], wife of [[Luís Carlos Prestes]] to Germany in 1937, Brazil was invited to be part of the [[Axis Powers]] at the side of Japan, Italy and Germany. However, when Brazil refused this invitation at the advent of the "[[Estado Novo (Brazil)#Estado Novo|Estado Novo]]" at the end of that same year, the relations between Brazil and the countries of the Axis started to chill.
[[File:Vargas e Roosevelt.jpg|thumb|right|Vargas (left) with U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], during the first visit of a sitting U.S. president to Brazil, 1936.]] 
Vargas sent Aimée Lopes de Sotto Maior, later known as [[Aimée de Heeren]], to Paris as a secret agent to investigate the situation in Europe.
Under cover as a "wealthy fashionista", Aimée connected with a range of society figures, not only French but also German, Italian and British. Through [[Helmuth James von Moltke]] she obtained secret information about Hitler's plans, prompting her to urge Vargas to withdraw from Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aimeedeheeren.com |title=Aimee de Heeren.com – Brazilian Secret Service Agent }}</ref> Aimée had a strong personal influence on the president.

This estrangement also occurred in part due to the German-Italian-Japanese powers becoming frustrated in regards to what they believed the Estado Novo should represent. The policy of forced [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] and nationalization imposed by Vargas and the military over every immigrant community, including German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese, as well as the prohibition of any political activities that were not directly endorsed by the central power in [[Rio de Janeiro]], which included the [[Nazi Party]] in Brazil and its allies, the [[Brazilian Integralism|Brazilian Integralists]], motivated Italian-Spanish-German support of the Integralists' ''coup d'état'' attempt in May 1938. The failure of that action and the British naval blockade on Atlantic trade with Germany, Italy and Spain, especially from 1940 onwards, led to a sharp deterioration of relations between Brazil and the Axis powers.<ref>Dennison de Oliveira, "Os soldados alemães de Vargas" Portuguese [Germans against Hitler; "The German soldiers of Vargas" ] 1st Chapter, Jurua print. 2008 {{ISBN|85-362-2076-7}}</ref>

====World War II and the fall of the New State====

From 1940, the US started to reach out to Brazilians with its "[[Good Neighbor Policy]]". The US also granted large loans to Brazil, which Vargas used to industrialize the country. Vargas, always a shrewd, low-key, and reasoned pragmatist, sided with the Allies for economic reasons after a period of ambiguity, since the Allies were more viable trading partners and helped with money.  However, he and the military were slowly forced to liberalize the regime because of complications arising from this alliance. In siding with the Allies, one agreement that Vargas made was to help the Allies with [[rubber]] production in order to receive loans and credit from the US. In reprisal for breaking off [[diplomatic relations]] in January 1942, and assigning air bases to Americans in the north of Brazil, [[Hitler]] ordered the extension of the [[Battle of the Atlantic|Axis naval offensive]] over the South Atlantic. After Brazil's merchant ships were sunk by German and Italian [[U-boat|submarines]], at the cost of hundreds of civilian deaths, Brazil sided with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], declared war on Germany and Italy on 22 August 1942 and eventually sent an [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|expeditionary force]] to fight in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Front]] in the second half of 1944.

This siding with the Allies created a paradox at home not unnoticed by Brazil's middle class – an authoritarian regime, still with some fascistic overtones, joining forces with the Allies.  This increased the anti-dictatorship sentiment at home even more. Vargas astutely responded to the newly liberal sentiments of a middle class that was no longer fearful of disorder and proletarian discontent by moving away from repression. He promised "a new postwar era of liberty" that included amnesty for political prisoners, presidential elections, and the legalization of opposition parties, including the moderated and irreparably weakened Communist Party. The forces released by this political liberalization severely weakened the Estado Novo and was substantial enough to prompt his own war ministry to force Vargas' resignation on 29 October 1945. Democracy returned a few months later with the [[1945 Brazilian general election|1945 presidential election]].

==Labor legislation==
Despite the passage of many labor laws (such as paid vacation, [[minimum wage]], and [[maternity leave]]), there were still many shortcomings in the enforcement and implementation of labor legislation.<ref>Loewenstein, Karl. ''Brazil Under Vargas''. New York: Russell & Russell, 1973. Pg 348</ref>  While it was impossible for the minimum wage laws to be evaded by large businesses or in large towns,<ref>Loewenstein, Karl. ''Brazil Under Vargas''. New York: Russell & Russell, 1973. Pg 347</ref> the minimum rural salary of 1943 was, in many cases, simply not abided by employers.<ref>Bourne, Richard. ''Getulio Vargas of Brazil, 1883–1954 Sphinx of the Pampas''. London: C. Knight, 1974. Pg 155</ref>  In fact, many social policies never extended to rural areas.<ref>Levine, Robert M. ''Brazilian Legacies''. Armonk, New York: M.E. Sharpe, 1997. Pg 47</ref>  While each state varied, social legislation was enforced less by the government and more by the good will of employers and officials in the remote regions of Brazil.<ref>Loewenstein, Karl. ''Brazil Under Vargas''. New York: Russell & Russell, 1973. Pg 351</ref>  Vargas' legislation did more for the industrial workers than for the more numerous agricultural workers,<ref>Bourne, Richard. ''Getulio Vargas of Brazil, 1883–1954 Sphinx of the Pampas''. London: C. Knight, 1974. Pg 198</ref> despite the fact that only relatively few industrial workers joined the unions that the government encouraged.<ref>Levine, Robert M. ''Father of the Poor?: Vargas and His Era''. New York: Cambridge UP, 1998. Pg 67</ref> The state-run social security system was inefficient and the Institute for Retirement and Social Welfare produced few results.<ref>Levine, Robert M. ''Brazilian Legacies''. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 1997. Pgs 186, 47</ref>  The popular backlash due to these shortcomings was evidenced by the rising popularity of the National Liberation Alliance.<ref>Bourne, Richard. ''Getulio Vargas of Brazil, 1883–1954 Sphinx of the Pampas''. London: C. Knight, 1974. Pg 70</ref>

==Time away from power==

==Second presidency==
[[File:17 - Getúlio Dorneles Vargas 1951.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Official photograph of Vargas' second term as President, 1951]]

When he left the Estado Novo presidency, the economic surplus of Brazil was high and the industry was growing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} After four years, however, pro-US President [[Eurico Dutra]] wasted huge quantities of money protecting foreign, mostly US, industry, and distanced himself from the ideas of nationalism and modernization of the country championed by Vargas.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Vargas returned to politics in 1951 and through a free and secret ballot was re-elected President of the Republic. Hampered by the economic crisis largely engendered by the policies of Dutra, Vargas pursued a nationalist policy, turning to the country's natural resources and away from foreign dependency.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} As part of this policy, he founded [[Petrobrás]] (Brazilian Petroleum), a large, multinational petroleum concern largely owned by the Government of Brazil.

==Death==

Vargas' political adversaries initiated a crisis which culminated in the [[Rua Tonelero#1954 attack|Rua Tonelero incident]], where Major Rubens Vaz was killed during an attempt on the life of Vargas' main adversary, [[Carlos Lacerda]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Lieutenant Gregório Fortunato, chief of Vargas' personal guard, also called "Black Angel", was accused of masterminding the assassination attempt. This aroused a reaction in the military against Vargas and the generals demanded his resignation. In a last-ditch effort Vargas called a special cabinet meeting on the eve of August 24, but rumors spread that the armed forces officers were implacable.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
[[File:GetulioVargasPijamaRevolver.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Vargas's pajamas and gun on exhibit at the [[Catete Palace|Republic Museum]] in Rio de Janeiro.]]

Having lost control of the situation, Vargas shot himself in the chest on August 24, 1954, in the [[Catete Palace]] with a pistol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/24/newsid_4544000/4544759.stm|title=1954: Brazilian president found dead|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=19 April 2009 | date= 1954}}</ref>

Vargas' [[Carta Testamento|suicide note]] was found and read on the radio two hours after his son discovered the body. The famous last lines read, "Serenely, I take my first step on the road to eternity. I leave life to enter history."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/24/newsid_4544000/4544759.stm|title=Brazilian president found dead|publisher=BBC|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref> Vargas' suicide has been interpreted in various ways. "His death by suicide simultaneously traded on the image of a valiant warrior selflessly fighting for the protection of national interests, alongside the image of a crafty and calculating statesman, whose political machinations reeked of demagoguery and self-interest."<ref>Daryle Williams and Barbara Weinstein, "Vargas Morto: The Death and Life of a Brazilian Statesman," in ''Death, Dismemberment, and Memory: Body Politics in Latin America'', edited by Lyman L. Johnson. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2004, p. 275.</ref> Riots broke out in Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre on August 24, 1954.<ref>Williams and Weinstein, "Vargas Morto", photo, p. 295</ref>

[[File:Traslado do corpo de Getúlio Vargas do Rio de Janeiro para o enterro em São Borja.tif|thumb|Transfer of the body of Getúlio Vargas from Rio de Janeiro for burial in São Borja, 26 August 1954.]]

The Vargas family refused a [[state funeral]], but his successor [[João Café Filho]] declared official days of mourning.<ref>Williams and Weinstein, "Vargas Morto", pp. 285–87.</ref> Vargas' body was on public view in a glass-topped coffin. The route of the cortege carrying the body from the Presidential Palace to the airport was lined with tens of thousands of Brazilians. The burial and memorial service were in his hometown of [[São Borja, Rio Grande do Sul|São Borja]], Rio Grande do Sul.<ref>Williams and Weinstein, "Vargas Morto" pp. 287–94.</ref>

The Museu Histórico Nacional was given the furnishings of the bedroom where Vargas committed suicide, and a museum gallery recreates the scene and is a site of remembrance.<ref>Williams and Weinstein, "Vargas Morto", pp. 299–301</ref> On exhibit in the Palace is his nightshirt with a bullet hole in the chest. The popular outrage that his suicide caused had supposedly been so strong that it thwarted the ambitions of his enemies, among them rightists, anti-nationalists, pro-[[United States]] elements, and even the pro-Prestes [[Brazilian Communist Party]] for several years.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
