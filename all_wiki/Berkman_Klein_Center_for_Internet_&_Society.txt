The '''Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society''' is a research center at [[Harvard University]] that focuses on the study of [[cyberspace]]. Founded at [[Harvard Law School]], the center traditionally focused on internet-related legal issues. On May 15, 2008, the center was elevated to an interfaculty initiative of Harvard University as a whole.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bradt |first=Steve |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2008/05.15/99-berkman.html |title=Harvard Gazette announcement of Berkman Center elevation to Harvard interfaculty initiative |publisher=News.harvard.edu |accessdate=August 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022192227/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2008/05.15/99-berkman.html |archive-date=2008-10-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is named after the Berkman family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/883|title=Berkman Gift of $5.4 Million to Support Professorship for Entrepreneurial Legal Studies and Center for Internet & Society|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> On July 5, 2016, the Center added "Klein" to its name following a gift of $15 million from Michael R.

== History and mission ==
[[File:Berkman Center.jpg|thumb|The location at 23 Everett Street]]

The center was founded in 1996 as the "Center on Law and Technology" by [[Jonathan Zittrain]] and Professor [[Charles Nesson]]. This built on previous work including a 1994 seminar they held on legal issues involving the early Internet. Professor Arthur Miller and students David Marglin and Tom Smuts also worked on that seminar and related discussions. In 1997, the Berkman family underwrote the center, and [[Lawrence Lessig]] joined as the first Berkman professor. In 1998, the center changed its name to the "Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/about/faq|website=Berkman Klein Center FAQ |title= Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Berkman Klein Center|accessdate=September 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/berkmanat10/Timeline|website=Berkman Klein Center Timeline |title=Timeline |publisher=Berkman Klein Center|accessdate=September 28, 2016}}</ref><ref name=swartz /> Since then, it has grown from a small project within [[Harvard Law School]] to a major interdisciplinary center at Harvard University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/slj/reviews/digitalresources/859154-315/harvardaposs_berkman_center_launches_publius.html.csp |title=Harvard's Berkman Center Launches Publius Project |publisher=Schoollibraryjournal.com |date=May 19, 2008 |accessdate=August 24, 2010}}</ref> The Berkman Klein Center seeks to understand how the development of Internet-related technologies is inspired by the social context in which they are embedded and how the use of those technologies affects society in turn. It seeks to use the lessons drawn from this research to inform the design of Internet-related law and pioneer the development of the Internet itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/about |title=About Berkman Center |date=November 3, 2008 |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}</ref> The Berkman Klein Center sponsors Internet-related events and conferences, and hosts numerous visiting lecturers and research fellows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/fellows |title=Berkman Center People: Fellows |publisher=Cyber.law.harvard.edu |accessdate=September 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906015228/http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/fellows |archive-date=2011-09-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Members of the center teach, write books, scientific articles, [[weblog]]s with [[RSS (file format)|RSS 2.0]] feeds (for which the Center holds the specification<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rssboard.org/advisory-board-notes |title=Advisory Board Notes |date=July 18, 2003 |publisher=[[RSS Advisory Board]] |accessdate=September 4, 2007 }}</ref>), and [[podcast]]s (of which the first series took place at the Berkman Klein Center). Its newsletter, ''The Buzz'', is on the Web and available by e-mail, and it hosts a blog community of Harvard faculty, students, and Berkman Klein Center affiliates.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QY_2CG9_bqEC |title=Az internet természete - Google Books |isbn=9789639664234 |accessdate=August 24, 2010|last1=László |first1=Ropolyi |year=2006 }}</ref>

The Berkman Klein Center faculty and staff have also conducted major public policy reviews of pressing issues. In 2008, [[John Palfrey]] led a review of child safety online called the Internet Safety Technical Task Force.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/02/harvard-myspace-spearhead-internet-safety-task-force.ars|title=Harvard, MySpace spearhead Internet safety task force|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> In 2009, [[Yochai Benkler]] led a review of United States broadband policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/opinion/21Benkler.html |title=Ending the Internet's Trench Warfare|author= Yochai Benkler|journal= New York Times Op-Ed|date= March 20, 2010}}</ref> In 2010, Urs Gasser, along with Palfrey and others, led a review of Internet governance body [[ICANN]], focusing on transparency, accountability, and public participation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-10aug10-en.htm|title=Accountability and Transparency Review Team – Selection of Independent Expert and Update on ATRT Review|work=icann.org|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref>

==Projects and initiatives==
The Berkman Klein Center's main research topics are Teens and Media, [[Computer and network surveillance|Monitoring]], [[Privacy]], [[Digital art]], [[Internet Governance]], [[Cloud Computing]] and [[Internet censorship]]. The Berkman Klein Center supports events, presentations, and conferences about the Internet and invites scientists to share their ideas.

=== Digital Media Law Project ===
The Digital Media Law Project (DMLP) was a project hosted by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School. It had previously been known as the Citizen Media Law Project. The purposes of the DMLP were:
# To provide resources and other assistance, including [[legal advice|legal assistance]]<ref name=auernheimer>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/document/brief-amicus-curiae-digital-media-law-project-support-defendant-appellant|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF.org]]|last1=Walsh|first1=Kit|last2=Hermes|first2=Jeffrey P.|last3=Sellars|first3=Andrew F.|date=2013-07-08|title=Brief of ''Amicus Curiae'' Digital Media Law Project in Support of Defendant-Appellant [Andrew Auernheimer]|accessdate=2015-08-31}}</ref> {{as of|2009|lc=y}},<ref name=benton/> to individuals and groups involved in online and citizen media.
# To "ensur[e] that online journalists, media organizations, and their sources are allowed to examine and debate network security and data protection vulnerabilities without criminal punishment, in order to inform citizens and lawmakers about networked computer security."<ref name=auernheimer/>
# To facilitate the participation of citizens in online media.
# To protect the freedom of speech on the Internet.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=R.|last2=Warne|first2=C.|year=2014|title=Digital Media Law Project|journal=Encyclopedia of Social Media and Politics|volume=4|pages=398–399|place=Thousand Oaks, CA|publisher=[[Sage Publications]], Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781452244723.n158|isbn=9781452244716}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/dmlp|title=Digital Media Law Project|website=Berkman Center for Internet & Society|publisher=[[Harvard]].edu|accessdate=2015-08-31}}</ref>
In 2014, Berkman Klein Center announced that it would "spin off its most effective initiatives and cease operation as a stand-alone project within the Berkman Klein Center."<ref name=benton>{{cite web|title=The Digital Media Law Project is shutting down, but its most important projects will find new homes|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/06/the-digital-media-law-project-is-shutting-down-but-its-most-important-projects-will-find-new-homes/|last=Benton|first=Joshua|date=2014-06-25|publisher=NiemanLab.org|accessdate=2015-08-31}}</ref>

=== Internet and Democracy Project ===
The Berkman Klein Center operated the now-completed Internet and Democracy Project, which describes itself as an:
{{quote|initiative that will examine how the Internet influences democratic norms and modes, including its impact on civil society, citizen media, government transparency, and the rule of law, with a focus on the Middle East. Through a grant of $1.5 million from the US Department of State's Middle East Partnership Initiative, the Berkman Center will undertake the study over the next two years in collaboration with its extended community and institutional partners.  As with all its projects, the Berkman Center retains complete independence in its research and other efforts under this grant.

The goal of this work is to support the rights of citizens to access, develop and share independent sources of information, to advocate responsibly, to strengthen online networks, and to debate ideas freely with both civil society and government. These subjects will be examined through a series of case studies in which new technologies and online resources have influenced democracy and civic engagement.  The project will include original research and the identification and development of innovative web-based tools that support the goals of the project.  The team, led by Project Director Bruce Etling, will draw on communities from around the world, with a focus on the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/internetdemocracy|title=Internet and Democracy - Berkman Center|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref>}}

=== StopBadware ===
In 2006, the center established the non-profit organization StopBadware, aiming to stop viruses, spyware, and other threats to the open Internet, in partnership with the [[Oxford Internet Institute]], [[Google]], [[Lenovo]] and [[Sun Microsystems]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mohammed|first1=Arshad|title=Internet Coalition Sets Up Anti-'Badware' Site|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/24/AR2006012401621.html|accessdate=3 February 2018|work=The Washington Post|date=25 January 2006}}</ref> In 2010, StopBadware became an independent entity supported by [[Google]], [[PayPal]], and [[Mozilla]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Mary Helen|title=StopBadware Spins Off From Harvard U. to Be a Stand-Alone Nonprofit Group|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/stopbadware-spins-off-from-harvard-u-to-be-a-stand-alone-nonprofit-group/20915|accessdate=3 February 2018|publisher=The Chronicle of HIgher Education|date=28 January 2010}}</ref>

=== Digital Public Library of America ===
The [[Digital Public Library of America]] is a project aimed at making a large-scale digital public library accessible to all.

=== Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence ===
In 2017, the BKC received a $27M grant with the [[MIT Media Lab]] to "advance [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]] research for the public good"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.mit.edu/2017/mit-media-lab-to-participate-in-ai-ethics-and-governance-initiative-0110|title=MIT Media Lab to participate in $27 million initiative on AI ethics and governance|website=MIT News|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref> and "to ensure automation and [[machine learning]] are researched, developed, and deployed in a way which vindicate social values of fairness, human autonomy, and justice".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2019/04/26/why-tech-billionaires-are-spending-to-restrain-artificial-intelligence/|title=Why Tech Billionaires Are Spending To Restrain Artificial Intelligence|last=Williams|first=Oliver|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>
