'''Samuel Taliaferro Rayburn''' (January 6, 1882 – November 16, 1961) was an American politician who served as the 43rd [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]]. He was a three-time House Speaker, former House Majority Leader, two-time House Minority Leader, and a 24-term congressman, representing [[Texas's 4th congressional district]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from 1913 to 1961. He holds the record for the [[List of Speakers of the United States House of Representatives#Speakers by time in office|longest tenure as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]], serving for over 17 years (among his three separate stints).

Born in [[Roane County, Tennessee]], Rayburn moved with his family to [[Windom, Texas]], in 1887. After a period as a school teacher, Rayburn won election to the [[Texas House of Representatives]] and graduated from the [[University of Texas School of Law]]. He won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1912 and continually won re-election until his death in 1961, serving 25 terms all told. Rayburn was a protege of [[John Nance Garner]] and a mentor to [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

Rayburn was elected House Majority Leader in 1937 and was elevated to the position of Speaker of the House after the death of [[William B. Bankhead]]. He led the House Democrats from 1940 to 1961, and served as Speaker of the House from 1940 to 1947, 1949 to 1953, and 1955 to 1961. Rayburn also served twice as House Minority Leader (1947 to 1949 and 1953 to 1955) during periods of Republican House control. He preferred to work quietly in the background and successfully used his power of persuasion and charisma to get his bills passed due to having to navigate the post-[[Joseph Gurney Cannon|Joseph Cannon]] era when each individual committee chairman had immense power in the House.

Along with Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson, Rayburn refused to sign the 1956 [[Southern Manifesto]] and helped shepherd to passage the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957|Civil Rights Acts of 1957]] and [[Civil Rights Act of 1960|1960]], the first civil rights bills passed by the U.S. Congress since the [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction Era]] (1863–1877). Rayburn was also influential in the construction of [[U.S. Route 66]]. He served as Speaker until his death in 1961, and was succeeded by [[John W. McCormack]].

== Early life ==
Rayburn was born in [[Roane County, Tennessee]], on January 6, 1882. He was the son of Martha Clementine (Waller) and William Marion Rayburn, a former Confederate cavalryman.<ref name="Brown2005">{{cite book|first=Fred|last=Brown|title=Marking Time: East Tennessee Historical Markers and the Stories Behind Them|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sem9B2acPfkC&pg=PA270|year=2005|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press|isbn=978-1-57233-330-7|page=270}}</ref> The Rayburn family descended from [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Ulster Scots immigrants]] who emigrated to the [[Province of Pennsylvania]] in 1750.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hardeman|first1=D.

Rayburn grew up in poverty as he, his nine siblings, and his parents all participated in running the farm. Toiling in the fields made Rayburn determined to get a good education and help the poor and downtrodden.

Rayburn went to [[co-educational]] East Texas Normal College (now [[Texas A&M University–Commerce]]) in [[Commerce, Texas|Commerce]] in 1900 with $25 (around $750 in 2020) that his father saved up to help take care of his first few months of college expenses. To help cover tuition and room and board, Rayburn rang the school bell to signal the end of classes and swept out Commerce's public school buildings, earning $3 a month. Rayburn obtained his teaching credentials before completing his bachelor of science degree, and earned additional income by teaching in the public school of Greenwood, a small community in [[Hopkins County, Texas|Hopkins County]]. He graduated in 1903 in a class of 13 (9 men and 4 women) and taught school for two years.<ref name="Dolph Briscoe Center for American History 2013">{{cite web | title=Biography - Sam Rayburn Museum | website=Dolph Briscoe Center for American History | date=December 19, 2013 | url=https://www.cah.utexas.edu/museums/rayburn_bio.php | access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref><ref name="North Texas e-News 2003">{{cite web | title=Sam Rayburn's feat of graduation | website=North Texas e-News | date=August 16, 2003 | url=http://www.ntxe-news.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=3&num=8370 | access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref>

==Texas State Legislature==
In 1906, at the age of 24, Rayburn won by a narrow 163 vote margin an election to the 34th district of the [[Texas House of Representatives]]. While serving in the legislature, he studied at the [[University of Texas School of Law]], and he was admitted to the bar in 1908.[[File:WahrenbergerHouseAustinTX.JPG|thumb|left|Rayburn lived at the [[Wahrenberger House]] from 1907 to 1908 when he served as a Texas Representative for the 34th district and studied at the University of Texas School of Law.]] As a representative, Rayburn helped pass laws that made textbooks more widely available to Texas schoolchildren, established the State Board of Health alongside the [[Texas Department of State Health Services|Texas State Department of Health]], and created the [[Texas Department of Agriculture]]. Due to his power of persuasion when he was a very young legislator for four years on January 10, 1911, at 29 years of age, Rayburn became the youngest [[Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives]] in history. He defeated Clarence E. Gilmore 70 to 63 in the speaker election. Texas speakers from the beginning of statehood until Rayburn's tenure were mostly ceremonial and powerless, similar to the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate]]. Under Texas state law the office actually had immense powers but the previous speakers never exercised them due to deference to party bosses. Upon election as Speaker, Rayburn requested the appointment of a special committee to determine "the duties and rights of the speaker". This became the first ever codification of the speaker's power. He helped pass numerous legislation as Speaker such as shorter working hours for women, child labor laws, and appropriations for a Confederate widows home and a tuberculosis sanitarium. Many decades later Rayburn rated his service as Texas House Speaker as the most enjoyable period in his long political career. He said, "that job had real power-that's what a man wants-but power's no good unless you have the guts to use it."<ref name="Library 1961">{{cite web | last=Library | first=Texas Legislative Reference | title=Legislators and Leaders - Member profile | website=Legislative Reference Library | date=November 16, 1961 | url=https://lrl.texas.gov/legeleaders/members/memberDisplay.cfm?memberID=3037 | access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref><ref name="CoxPhillips2010">{{cite book|first1=Patrick L.|last1=Cox|first2=Michael|last2=Phillips|title=The House Will Come To Order: How the Texas Speaker Became a Power in State and National Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KjrPDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA27|date=March 1, 2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-72205-7|page=27}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Due to a series of lucky events for Rayburn, the House district of his home county of Fannin County, the [[Texas's 4th congressional district|fourth district]], was open for him to run. Senator [[Joseph Weldon Bailey]] was rocked by allegations of corruption and bribery involving oil companies so he announced his resignation effective January 1913. The longtime incumbent representative of the fourth district, [[Choice B. Randell]], ran for Bailey's open senate seat in the 1913 election and lost. Rayburn won election to the House of Representatives in 1912 after a bruising Democratic primary where he won by only 490 votes. He won the general election afterwards and became a Representative. He entered Congress in 1913 at the beginning of [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s presidency and served in office for almost 49 years (more than 24 terms), until the beginning of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s presidency.<ref name="auto">{{Cite journal|last=Shanks|first=Alexander G|date=1968|title=Sam Rayburn in the Wilson Administrations, 1913-1921|url=https://scholarworks.sfasu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1147&context=ethj|journal=East Texas Historical Journal|volume=6|pages=9}}</ref>

Rayburn was a protege of then-Representative [[John Nance Garner]]. Despite Rayburn's freshman status, in 1913, Garner helped him become a member of the powerful [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee]], which handled legislation pertaining to commerce, bridges, coal, oil, communication, motion pictures, securities exchanges, holding companies and the [[U.S. Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]. Rayburn learned how to make deals and how to deal with adversity during his first two decades in the House. While he was a young representative he introduced and helped pass numerous anti-trust and railroad-related legislation such as the [[Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914]], the [[Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914]] and the [[Esch–Cummins Act|Esch–Cummins Transportation Act]] (The Railway Stock and Bond Bill that was originally introduced in 1914 was the first ever major legislation that was crafted and proposed by Rayburn. In 1920 it finally became law in the Esch-Cummins Act).<ref name="auto"/><ref name="Fannin County Historical Commission 1961">{{cite web | title=Congressman Rayburn | website=Fannin County Historical Commission | date=November 16, 1961 | url=http://fannincountyhistory.org/congressman-rayburn.html | access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref>

As a signal of things to come for Rayburn, after only eight years in the House he was elected to be [[Democratic Caucus Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|House Democratic Caucus Chairman]]. He served as Chairman from 1921 to 1923. At only age 39 when he was elected Chairman he was the youngest person ever elected to that position. During the 1920s, Rayburn kept a low profile due to the Republican dominance of Congress and the Presidency under Presidents Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover. Rayburn's biggest contribution in this decade was to help create the [[U.S. Highway System]] in 1926, the first major victory of his lifelong dream to make paved roads available for all Americans.

[[File:DenisonDam 01-2006.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Denison Dam]] located in Rayburn's House district was authorized by the [[Flood Control Act of 1938]]. The dam created [[Lake Texoma]].]]

From 1931 to 1937, Rayburn was Chairman of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee. Due to his position and influence on this committee he helped pass landmark [[New Deal]] bills such as the [[Securities Act of 1933|Truth in Securities Act]], the bills that established the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] and the [[Federal Communications Commission]], the [[Public Utilities Holding Company Act]], the Emergency Railroad Transportation Act, and the [[Rural Electrification Act]].<ref name="Famous Texans 1913">{{cite web | title=Sam Rayburn | website=Famous Texans | date=April 7, 1913 | url=http://www.famoustexans.com/samrayburn.htm | access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref>

Rayburn was a big supporter of projects that helped make life easier for farmers and rural Americans like dams and [[farm-to-market road]]s. His role in creating new lakes such as [[Lake Texoma]] and changing old rural dirt roads into fully paved roads ensured his congressional district constituents to support him for life. The dams in rural America controlled rivers from flooding and also generated electricity. The [[Flood Control Act of 1936]] combined with the Rural Electrification Act helped to bring electricity to 90% of rural America by 1959, compared to only 3% in the early 1930s. In 1943-44, Rayburn helped to establish in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, and Louisiana the [[Southwestern Power Administration]], which became a "mini-[[Tennessee Valley Authority]]" in the region. The main difference from the TVA was the SWPA only involved federal dams constructed by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]. He also helped pass laws that established the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service|Soil Conservation Service]] and the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. These two agencies were primarily engaged in [[erosion control|water and soil erosion control]] due to the negative effects of farming in America that led to catastrophes like the [[Dust Bowl]].<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 30240993|title = Sam Rayburn and the Development of Public Power in the Southwest|journal = The Southwestern Historical Quarterly|volume = 78|issue = 2|pages = 140–154|last1 = Brown|first1 = D.

== Speaker of the House ==

[[Image:Samuel Taliaferro Rayburn.jpg |thumb|left|upright|Portrait by Douglas Chandor, 1941]]

On September 16, 1940, at the age of 58, and while serving as [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]], Rayburn became [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] upon the sudden death of Speaker [[William Bankhead]]. Rayburn's ascension to the speakership was surprisingly rapid; that including Bankhead, the three Speakers prior to Rayburn died in office within six years. ([[Henry Thomas Rainey]] died in 1934 and [[Jo Byrns]] in 1936.)<ref>{{cite news |last=Timmons |first=Bascom N. |date=October 24, 1961 |title=Rayburn Maneuvers Kept U.S. Moving in 1941 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/22091354/ |work=Lawton Constitution |location=Lawton, OK |url-access=subscription |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |page=14}}</ref>

Rayburn's first major crisis after assuming the speakership was [[World War II]]. In the decade prior to the war, the United States was isolationist and decided to not participate in the war when war broke out in 1937 in Asia and 1939 in Europe. Rayburn helped pass the [[Lend-Lease Act]] in March 1941. This act allowed the U.S. to distribute food, oil, and [[Materiel|materiel]] to the United Kingdom, China, and the Soviet Union. In August 1941, he helped pass the Service Extension Act of 1941. In 1940, a 12-month peacetime draft was instituted by the government to prepare for possible war. The isolationists in the House wanted to not get involved in the war though and wanted to let the peacetime draft expire after 12 months in 1941. What Rayburn did is considered legendary. He talked to all representatives who were anti-draft and tried to persuade them to change their minds. He got it passed by a vote of 203–202, a one-vote margin. If this bill had been defeated the U.S. Army stood to lose about two-thirds of its strength and three-fourths of the officer corps due to the end of the draft.<ref name="Washington Post 1991">{{cite web | title=How Mr. Sam Saved the Draft | website=Washington Post | date=August 18, 1991 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1991/08/18/how-mr-sam-saved-the-draft/40056dca-450a-4dce-b1cd-cb123ef36139/ | access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref>

In early 1942, top Roosevelt officials approached Rayburn and asked him to work discreetly with Congress to gain funding for the production of an [[atomic bomb]]. Later that year, Rayburn secured $1.6 billion to fund the [[Manhattan Project]], the code name for the secret project that led to the creation of the atomic bomb. This secret operation was done with most of the President's own cabinet and even vice presidents as well as all members of Congress except a handful not knowing about the atomic bomb. Only Rayburn, the Senate Majority Leader, and five other congressmen were aware of this operation. Rayburn had to hide the Manhattan Project through fake names and other deceptive means in appropriation bills until the bombs were used in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntxe-news.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=21&num=36836|title=Sam Rayburn and World War II|website=North Texas e-News|access-date=January 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/ops/ci/docs/ci2/2ch1_f.htm|title=Retrieved 26 December 2018.|access-date=January 6, 2019}}</ref>

In 1946, the Republicans swept the Democrats in the midterm elections, winning both the House and Senate. The Democrats lost [[1946 United States House of Representatives elections|54 seats]] in the House. Rayburn felt that because he lost in such an overwhelming manner he should step down as House Democratic Leader and not be the Minority Leader in the upcoming congress (this would have likely ended in an early retirement for him before the end of the 1940s). He endorsed the northern Democrat [[John W. McCormack]] for Minority Leader, but there was a "draft Rayburn" movement initiated by President Truman, McCormack himself, and all the northern and southern Democrats. To all of the Democrats without Rayburn as their leader the Democratic Party would have been torn apart by inter-factionalism between northern and southern Democrats and liberal and conservative Democrats. Many people in Washington were then aware of how important Speaker Rayburn was to hold the Democratic Party together. Rayburn accepted the Minority Leader position and remained the House Democratic Leader for the rest of his life. To show how much they appreciated Rayburn to stay in office as House Democratic Leader, 142 House Democrats and 50 House Republicans surprised Rayburn with a special gift, a 1947 Cadillac. The House Speaker was provided a government-funded vehicle and the representatives felt bad that now Minority Leader Rayburn would have no car in Washington. Rayburn had a strict personal rule to never accept gifts more than $25 to avoid being bribed. The congressmembers circumvented this rule by combining their single $25 checks together to pay for the car. Rayburn returned all 50 Republican representatives' checks (to avoid a conflict of interest) but graciously thanked them for their gesture.<ref name="Champagne2009">{{cite book|first=Anthony|last=Champagne|title=The Austin-Boston Connection: Five Decades of House Democratic Leadership, 1937-1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=emcgJpUb78AC&pg=PA124|year=2009|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|isbn=978-1-60344-326-5|page=124}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thc.texas.gov/historic-sites%E2%80%8B/%E2%80%8Bsam-rayburn-house/history/rayburns-1947-cadillac|title=Rayburn's 1947 Cadillac - THC.Texas.gov - Texas Historical Commission|website=www.thc.texas.gov|access-date=January 6, 2019}}</ref>

In 1947–48, Rayburn as Minority Leader helped pass the [[Marshall Plan]] and the aid package that supported the [[Truman Doctrine]] that supported non-communist European countries and helped to stop the spread of communism. He also had to deal with the southern Democrats' ([[Dixiecrats]]') reaction to President Truman's call for very swift civil rights legislation. The committees were dominated by very powerful southern Democrats who were pro-segregation so these civil rights bills were dead on arrival. Rayburn had to be the moderate between the conservatives and liberals as well as the northern and southern Democrats so he rebuffed Truman's extremely fast civil rights bills but also rejected the southern Democrats' calls for a pro-segregation candidate to run in place of Truman in the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 presidential election]]. Rayburn was against a swift poll tax repeal and other fast-track civil rights legislation but also ordered the pro-segregation Democrats to run as a third-party due to his fears that the northern Democrats would boycott the election and help the Republicans win the election. Rayburn was a staunch supporter of Truman and was for a gradual civil rights legislation rollout that wouldn't be too fast and immediate due to the fears of the backlash by southern Democrats. In 1949, after his successful efforts to win back the House, Senate, and Truman's re-election he became Speaker again and supported a repeal of the Texas poll tax. He said that a repeal of the poll tax in Texas would aid the United States in its battle with the Soviet Union for the world's hearts and minds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cah.utexas.edu/projects/speakers_41_50.php|title=41st through 50th - Guide to Speakers of the Texas House - Texas House Speakers Oral History - Projects|first=UT Austin|last=Dolph Briscoe Center for American History|date=November 11, 2008|website=www.cah.utexas.edu|access-date=January 6, 2019}}</ref>

From 1949 to 1953, Rayburn was Speaker again. He supported Truman's [[Fair Deal]] but the [[Conservative Coalition]] of conservative Republicans and conservative Democrats blocked the Fair Deal legislation from being passed. During his second tenure as Speaker he focused mostly on passing anti-Soviet legislation and getting House support for Truman and the military in the [[Korean War]]. By 1952 the Korean War bogged down and Truman's popularity crashed. He chose not to run for re-election as a result and the Republicans won the House, Senate, and presidency.

[[File:Alaska Statehood signing.jpg|thumb|right|Rayburn and President Eisenhower shaking hands at the signing ceremony for the [[Alaska Statehood Act]]]]
Rayburn's second time as Minority Leader coincided with President Eisenhower's first two years of his presidency. [[McCarthyism]] was in full swing so both parties were trying their best to portray themselves as anti-communist. The [[Communist Control Act of 1954]] and the continuing defense of South Korea and Taiwan and South Vietnam were supported by Rayburn and most Democrats. Rayburn and the Democrats won back the House and Senate in the [[1954 United States elections|1954 elections]].

Rayburn's third and final tenure as Speaker from 1955 to 1961 was one of the greatest moments of his career. His protege Senator [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] became Majority Leader mostly thanks to Rayburn maneuvering the Senate leadership and making deals to make sure Johnson became Senate Democratic Leader. The trio of Rayburn, Eisenhower, and Johnson worked together well and passed numerous landmark bills such as the [[National Interstate and Defense Highways Act]] that established the [[Interstate Highway System]], the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]] that established [[NASA]], the [[Federal Aviation Act of 1958]] that established the [[FAA]], the [[National Defense Education Act]], the [[Colorado River Storage Project|Colorado River Storage Project Act]], the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]] and the [[Civil Rights Act of 1960]], which were the first civil rights acts passed since [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]].

[[File:Kennedy inauguration footage.ogv|thumb|left|Rayburn swears in Lyndon B. Johnson as Vice President on January 20, 1961 (1:19)]]
In 1958–59, Rayburn helped admit [[Alaska Statehood Act|Alaska]] and [[Hawaii Admission Act|Hawaii]] into the United States as the 49th and 50th states. Rayburn heavily fought for Alaska after realizing that then-Democratic Alaska would counter then-Republican Hawaii in the Senate and [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]]. In 1961, Rayburn wanted to pass more civil rights legislation along with President Kennedy but the powerful [[House Rules Committee]] was dominated by a conservative coalition of Democrats and Republicans who rejected any socially liberal legislation. Rayburn sought to end the impasse by changing House rules to add three spots (two majority and one minority) to the committee. Rayburn defended his plan in a rare speech on the House floor. "I think this House should be allowed on great measures to work its will and it cannot work its will if the Committee on Rules is so constituted as not to allow the House to pass on those things." In a 217–212 vote, Rayburn and the Democratic leadership won a narrow but significant victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/990821onthisday_big.html|title=On This Day: August 21|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=January 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail|title=Texas Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn's Bold Move to Increase the Size of the Committee on Rules - US House of Representatives: History, Art & Archives|website=history.house.gov|access-date=January 6, 2019}}</ref>

From 1940 until his death in 1961, Rayburn was the leader of the House Democrats. His career as speaker was interrupted twice: 1947–1949 and 1953–1955, when Republicans controlled the House. During those periods of Republican rule, Rayburn served as [[Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader]]. However, he so disliked the term "minority leader" that he asked to be referred to as the "Democratic Leader" during the years when the office of speaker was held by the Republican [[Joseph W. Martin Jr.]] of [[Massachusetts]], who was actually a close personal friend of Rayburn's.<ref name=wtha>Anthony Champagne, [[University of Texas at Dallas]], "Sam Rayburn", [[West Texas Historical Association]] joint meeting with the [[East Texas Historical Association]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], February 26, 2010.</ref>

[[File:RayburnOfficefromDome.jpg|thumb|right|Rayburn's influence and great rapport with congressmembers and the Washington bureaucracy allowed the [[Rayburn House Office Building]] to be designed and built within 10 years. At 2.4 million square feet, it is larger than the next two largest Capitol office buildings combined.]]
Himself a protege of [[Vice President of the United States]] [[John Nance Garner]], Rayburn was a close friend and mentor of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and knew Johnson's father, [[Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr.|Sam]], from their days in the Texas Legislature. Rayburn was instrumental to Lyndon Johnson's ascent to power, particularly his rapid rise to the position of [[Senate Minority Leader|Minority Leader]]. Johnson had been in the Senate for a mere four years when he assumed the role. Johnson also owed his subsequent elevation to [[Senate Majority Leader|Majority Leader]] to Rayburn. Like Johnson, Rayburn did not sign the [[Southern Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=3020998 |first=Tony |last=Badger |title=Southerners Who Refused to Sign the Southern Manifesto |journal=[[The Historical Journal]] |volume=42 |issue=2 |year=1999 |pages=517–534 |doi=10.1017/s0018246x98008346}}</ref>

As Speaker of the House, Rayburn forged close friendships and partnerships with [[legislatures]] of emerging independent countries and democracies on the continent of [[Africa]], especially [[Nigeria]], a rising political power on that continent. Rayburn was a good friend of [[Jaja Wachuku]], the first indigenous [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of Nigeria|Nigerian House of Representatives]], from 1959 to 1960.

=== Personal integrity ===
Although many Texas legislators were on the payroll of public service corporations, Rayburn refused to be. As he recounted in a speech during his congressional campaign:
<blockquote>When I became a member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were representing the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe Railroad Company]], receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.<ref>H. G. Dulaney & Edward Hake Phillips, ''Speak, Mr. Speaker'' 20 (1978).</ref></blockquote>

This practice of refusing to accept fees from clients with interests before the legislature was "virtually unheard-of" at the time.<ref>Anthony Champagne, ''Congressman Sam Rayburn'' 32 (1984)</ref> Later, while serving in Congress, a wealthy oil man had a very expensive horse delivered to Rayburn's farm in Bonham. No one apparently knew the oil man delivered the horse except him, Rayburn, and a Rayburn staffer. Rayburn returned the horse.<ref>Anthony Champagne, ''Congressman Sam Rayburn'' 31 (1984)</ref>

H.G. Dulaney, an aide to Rayburn and later the director of the Sam Rayburn Library and Museum, said that after speaking in Texas on one occasion Rayburn learned his driver had been given an envelope with money inside from the sponsor of the speech. He said Rayburn made the driver turn around and return the money. Author [[Robert Caro]] said, "No one could buy him. Lobbyists could not buy him so much as a meal. Not even the taxpayer could buy him a meal. He refused not only fees but travel expenses for out-of-town speeches; hosts who . . . attempted to press checks upon him quickly realized they had made a mistake. . . . Rayburn would say, 'I'm not for sale' - and then he would walk away without a backward glance."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=3545640&itype=NGPSID|title=Bennett backs off on ethics remarks|last=Eddington|first=Mark|date=February 25, 2006|website=The Salt Lake Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref>

=== Legacy ===
[[Image:Rayburn-Sam-LOC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sam Rayburn]]
In shaping legislation, Rayburn preferred working quietly in the background to being in the public spotlight. As Speaker, he won a reputation for fairness and integrity. In his years in Congress, Rayburn always insisted on paying his own expenses, even going so far as to pay for his own travel expenses when inspecting the [[Panama Canal]] when his committee was considering legislation concerning it, rather than exercising his right to have the government pay for it. After he died his estate was valued at just under $300,000, which was mostly land he owned, and the amount of cash he had in various checking accounts was just over $26,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rayburnmrspeaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Inventory-Appraisement-of-Sam-Rayburn-Estate.pdf|title=Inventory & Appraisement of the Estate of Sam Rayburn, Fannin County Clerk's Office}}</ref>

Rayburn was well known among his colleagues for his after business hours "Board of Education" meetings in hideaway offices in the House. During these off-the-record sessions, the speaker and powerful committee chairmen would gather for poker, bourbon, and a frank discussion of politics. Rayburn alone determined who received an invitation to these gatherings; to be invited to even one was a high honor. On April 12, 1945, Vice President [[Harry Truman]], a regular attendee since his Senate days, had just arrived at the "Board of Education" when he received a phone call telling him to immediately come to the [[White House]], where he learned that [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was dead and he was now President of the United States.

Rayburn coined the term "[[Sun Belt]]" while strongly supporting the construction of [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]]. It originally ran south from [[Chicago]], through [[Oklahoma]], and then turned westward from Texas to [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]] before ending at the beach in [[Santa Monica, California]]. Arguing in favor of the project, he stated famously that America absolutely must connect "the Frost Belt with the Sun Belt".

Rayburn also had a knack for dressing to suit his occasion. While in [[Washington, D.C.]], he would sport expensive suits, starched shirts, and perfectly shined shoes. However, while back in his poorer district in Texas, Rayburn would wear simple shirts, blue jeans, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats. Several politicians have imitated this pattern, including [[Ronald Reagan]]'s example of clearing brush when at home in California, while wearing fine suits in Washington.

The phrase "A jackass can kick a barn down, but it takes a carpenter to build one" is attributed to Rayburn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,817667-2,00.html|title=THE CONGRESS: The Prelude of the 83rd|date=January 12, 1953|work=TIME.com|access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref>

[[James Roosevelt]], a [[U.S. representative]] from [[California]] and a son of [[Franklin Roosevelt|Franklin]] and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], once called Rayburn "the most impressive person in Congress". Rayburn had urged James not to follow in the footsteps of his brother, Representative [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr.]], of [[New York (state)|New York]], who, according to Rayburn, did not take seriously his duties of office. [[Thomas Abernethy (politician)|Thomas Abernethy]] of [[Mississippi]] said that Rayburn was the most influential Speaker in history because he could "work with liberals and conservatives, ran the House with a firm hand but was generous".<ref name=wtha/> [[William Colmer]], another Mississippian and the mentor of later Representative and U.S. Senator [[Trent Lott]], described Rayburn as a "very strong parliamentarian" and far more effective than his successor, [[John W. McCormack|John McCormack]] of Massachusetts, who, Colmer found, "wanted to be liked" by his colleagues.<ref name=wtha/>

Asked why he never sought the presidency, Rayburn said that he was "born in the wrong place at the wrong time" to undertake a national campaign.<ref name=wtha/> Rayburn was Speaker at a time that the greater power in the House rested with committee chairmen. He was himself readily accessible to members; historian Anthony Champagne of the [[University of Texas at Dallas]], a Rayburn scholar, views the Speaker as a "bridge between the northern and southern members" of the Democratic Party. Champagne recalled a report that Rayburn so understood the House that he was "married" to the body and could "feel the sentiment of the members" by merely being in their presence. He was careful to fight his own battles, Champagne said. Rayburn was a mentor to such younger members as [[Richard Bolling]] of [[Missouri]], [[Wilbur D. Mills]] of [[Arkansas]], [[Carl Albert]] of [[Oklahoma]], and [[Homer Thornberry]] and [[Jack Brooks (American politician)|Jack Brooks]], both of Texas.<ref name=wtha/> He was also readily accessible to constituents, who were invited to come to his home in Bonham and visit without prior notice.<ref name=wtha/>

His home in Texas, now known as the [[Sam Rayburn House Museum]], was designated a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]]. In 1957, Rayburn dedicated the [[Sam Rayburn Library and Museum]] in [[Bonham, Texas|Bonham]] in the style of a [[presidential library]] to preserve his memory, library collection, honors, and mementos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://av.cah.utexas.edu/index.php/Rayburn:Dv_00147|title=Rayburn:Dv 00147 - GLIFOS|website=av.cah.utexas.edu|access-date=January 6, 2019}}</ref>

B. Hardeman and Donald C. Bacon guessed that Rayburn's work schedule and long bachelorhood, combined with the couple's differing views on alcohol, contributed to the rift. The court's divorce file in [[Bonham, Texas]], has never been located, and Rayburn avoided speaking of his brief marriage. In 2014, the [[Associated Press]] reported the existence of a letter Rayburn wrote to Metze after her father died in June 1926.<ref>{{cite news|title=Letter Provides Peek At Personal Sam Rayburn|url=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/08/16/letter-provides-peek-at-personal-sam-rayburn/|work=CBS-DFW|agency=Associated Press|date=August 16, 2014}}</ref>

In 2016, the ''Plano Star Courier'' published a story about an article in the October 2016 issue of Southwestern Historical Quarterly (a scholarly journal published by the Texas State Historical Association) profiling Sam Rayburn's "lady friend" who was a woman named Margaret Fallon (Peggy) Palmer, the widow of former U.S. Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]], and her close relationship with Rayburn.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rayburn's "lady-friend": Local historians to publish former Speaker's personal life|url=http://starlocalmedia.com/planocourier/news/rayburn-s-lady-friend-local-historians-to-publish-former-speaker/article_a281ffaa-864f-11e6-9929-6f4b1bfdbfc3.html|work=Plano Star Courier|date=September 29, 2016}}</ref>

In 1956, Rayburn was [[baptism|baptized]] by Elder H. G. Ball in the [[Primitive Baptist]] Church, also known as Old Line Baptist or Hard Shell Baptist Church.

One of his greatest, most painful regrets was that he did not have a son, or as he was quoted as saying in ''[[The Years of Lyndon Johnson#Book One: The Path to Power (1982)|The Path to Power]]'', [[Robert Caro]]'s biography of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], "a towheaded boy to take fishing".<ref>''The Path to Power'', p. 333.</ref>

Rayburn died of [[cancer]] in 1961 at the age of 79 and was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]]. By the time of his death, he had served as Speaker for nearly twice as long as any of his predecessors.

Rayburn was a descendant of George Waller, a Revolutionary War militia officer from [[Henry County, Virginia]], and was an honorary president of the Colonel George Waller Chapter of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].<ref name=surname>{{cite web | title=Who's Who within the Waller Family | website=Alleylaw | date=September 16, 1940 | url=http://www.alleylaw.net/who.html | access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref>
