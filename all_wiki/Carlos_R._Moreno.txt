'''Carlos Roberto Moreno''' (born November 4, 1948) is an American [[jurist]] who is the former [[United States Ambassador to Belize]]. Previously, he served as a Judge of the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] from February 4, 1998, to October 18, 2001, and as an Associate Justice of the [[Supreme Court of California]] from October 18, 2001, to February 28, 2011. Following his retirement from the bench in 2011, Moreno was counsel with [[Irell & Manella]].

==Early life and family==
Moreno is the son of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] immigrants, his mother arrived in the country with few skills and no resources after the death of his father at a young age. He grew up in a home where Spanish was the first language and where no family member had an education beyond high school.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dolan|first1=Maura|title=Determined to Deliver on a Dream, Profile: Carlos Moreno worked and studied hard to advance from a modest L.A. background to his nomination to the state Supreme Court|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/sep/30/local/me-51696|accessdate=September 22, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 30, 2001}}</ref> In a speech at the [[UC Davis School of Law]] (King Hall), he told students, "I never in my wildest dreams thought that I could become one of seven judges on the highest court in the state. I want to emphasize to you the idea that no matter what your dreams may be, you can follow them."

A native of [[Los Angeles]], Moreno grew up in a small community in Elysian Park known as [[Solano Canyon]]. He attended local public schools (such as Solano Elementary) before going east to [[Yale University]], from which he graduated in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |title=Associate Justice Carlos R.

As Deputy City Attorney, he prosecuted criminal and civil consumer protection cases, and handled politically sensitive and legislative matters for the City Attorney. In 1979, he joined the firm of Mori & Ota (which became part of [[Kelley Drye & Warren]]) representing the firm's business clients in its general commercial litigation practice.

==Judicial service==
[[File:CarlosMoreno.jpg|thumb|Carlos Moreno's official portrait as Associate Justice of the [[Supreme Court of California]]]]
Moreno's service in the judiciary began with his appointment in 1986 to the Los Angeles Municipal Court, Compton Judicial District, by Governor [[George Deukmejian]]. In that capacity, he adjudicated criminal matters, with an emphasis on serious felony offenses, and supervised the court's civil department until 1993, when Governor [[Pete Wilson]] elevated him to the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]], where he presided over felony trials.<ref>{{cite news|title=Century City: Ex-City Official Found Guilty of Soliciting Bribe|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-05/local/me-62609_1_century-city|accessdate=September 22, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 5, 1995}}</ref>

Moreno was nominated by President [[Bill Clinton]] on July 31, 1997, to a seat on the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] vacated by Judge [[Robert Mitsuhiro Takasugi]]. He was confirmed by the Senate on February 3, 1998, and received commission on February 4, 1998. His service terminated on October 18, 2001, due to resignation.

Moreno was appointed to the Supreme Court of California following his nomination by Governor [[Gray Davis]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dolan|first1=Maura|title=Davis Selects Nominee for High Court|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/sep/26/news/mn-50050|accessdate=September 22, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 26, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dolan|first1=Maura|last2=Rosenzweig|first2=David|title=High Court Nominee Vows to Emphasize Consensus, Profile: Carlos Moreno's confirmation would make him the lone Democrat on state high court|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/sep/27/local/me-50473|accessdate=September 22, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 27, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dolan|first1=Maura|title=Moreno Sworn In as Justice of California Supreme Court|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/oct/19/local/me-59044|accessdate=September 22, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 19, 2001}}</ref> In November 2002, California voters confirmed Moreno for the remainder of the term of his deceased predecessor, Justice [[Stanley Mosk]].

As an Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court, Moreno reviewed on appeal a wide range of civil and criminal cases, which have substantial state and federal constitutional implications. With his appointment to the Supreme Court of California, he became only the third judge of Hispanic heritage to serve in the Court's nearly 150-year history, and the first in more than a decade, since [[Cruz Reynoso]].

On January 6, 2011, Moreno announced his intention to retire from the California Supreme Court effective February 28, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/presscenter/newsreleases/NR02-11.PDF |title=Justice Moreno Announces Retirement from State Supreme Court |author= |date=January 6, 2011 |work= |publisher=Judicial Council of California |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Elias|first1=Thomas D.|title=Column: Brown can put his stamp on California Supreme Court|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2014/07/01/thomas-d-elias-column-brown-can-put-his-stamp-on-california-supreme-court/|accessdate=September 22, 2017|work=San Jose Mercury News|date=July 1, 2014}}</ref> After leaving the court, Moreno was counsel with the Irell & Manella.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irell.com/news-96.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421081130/http://www.irell.com/news-96.html |archivedate=2011-04-21 }}</ref> In April 2017, he began working as a mediator and arbitrator in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Former California Supreme Court Justice Carlos R.
