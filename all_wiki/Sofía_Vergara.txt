=== Embryo lawsuits===
[[File:Modern_Family_filming_in_Australia_-_b.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Modern Family'' filming on Bondi Beach, Sydney, Australia]]

In 2015–2017, Vergara was involved in a legal dispute regarding the future of two fertilized [[embryo]]s produced by [[in vitro fertilization]] while she was still in a relationship with Loeb;<ref name=bbc2015>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32547470 |title=TV star Sofia Vergara in battle over frozen embryos |date=May 1, 2015 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=May 30, 2015 }}</ref> the embryos were kept in storage in [[cryopreservation]] in a medical clinic in [[California]].<ref name=zadrozny/> Following the couple's split in 2014, Loeb filed a lawsuit for [[child custody|custody]] of the embryos in a [[law of California|California court]], but he later dropped that lawsuit when the court demanded that Loeb identify two women who had [[abortion]]s after he had impregnated them.<ref>
[https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_95818 Actress Sofia Vergara to be sued 'by her own embryos'] ''BioNews'', Chee Hoe Low, 12 December 2016</ref>

In December 2016, a [[right to live|right-to-live]] lawsuit against Vergara was initiated in Louisiana with Vergara's embryos as [[plaintiff]]s. The embryos were named "Emma" and "Isabella" in the lawsuit, and their "trustee" was listed as James Charbonnet, a [[New Orleans]] resident of no relation to Vergara. The intent of the suit was to give the embryos a chance to further develop using a [[surrogacy|surrogate carrier]], hence to be born, and to benefit from an [[inheritance]] trust that had been created for them and is administered by Charbonnet.<ref name="zadrozny">{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/12/08/crazy-vergara-embryo-case-could-open-floodgates.html| author=Brandy Zadrozny| title=Sofia Vergara Embryo Case Could Open Floodgates| publisher=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=December 8, 2016| accessdate=December 9, 2016}}</ref><ref name="esmith">{{cite news |url=http://pagesix.com/2016/12/06/sofia-vergara-sued-by-her-own-embryos/ |author=Emily Smith |title=Sofia Vergara sued by her own embryos| publisher=[[New York Post]]| date=December 6, 2016 |accessdate=December 8, 2016}}</ref> While a contract between Vergara and Loeb had been signed prior to the creation of the embryos stipulating that neither party could use the embryos without the consent of the other, the lawsuit had tried to void this agreement.<ref name="esmith" /> Loeb had written “Keeping them frozen forever is tantamount to killing them,” in a 2015 [[op-ed]] in the ''[[New York Times]]''.<ref>

The legal case was novel and took advantage of Louisiana's embryo [[law of Louisiana|laws]];<ref name="zadrozny" /> the state passed a law in 1986 that declares embryos to be “juridical persons,” giving embryos the right to sue or be sued.<ref name="RUTH GRAHAM">[https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/12/sofia-vergaras-frozen-embryos-emma-and-isabella-are-suing-her.html Sofia Vergara’s Frozen Embryos, “Emma” and “Isabella,” Are Suing Her] RUTH GRAHAM, [[slate.com]]
