==Funding criticisms==
There have been critiques of the Office on Violence Against Women. Generally, the criticisms regard the implementation of the Office on Violence Against Women's programs and how effective the programs have been in actually decreasing domestic violence.  While many scholars do not object to the idea of the [[Violence Against Women Act]], some specialists have opinions about to whom, where and how the Office on Violence Against Women should allocate its funding.

A study from the [[Journal of Marriage and Family]] stated that the "VAWA does not specifically target funds to areas that are in the greatest need-communities with the most intimate partner violence. Instead of being targeted, such organizations must apply for VAWA funding.  Although some effort has been made to distribute funds to reach the high-need areas and to address specific inadequacies, the funding process currently favors existing organizations.  However, this may not be the most effective way of reaching communities with the greatest need".<ref name="Services">"Services and Intimate Partner Violence in the United States: A County-Level Analysis."National Council of Family Relations:Journal of Marriage and Family, Vol. 67, No. 3 (Aug. 2005), pp. 565-578.

==Challenges==

===Mandatory arrest laws===

While Congress was preparing to reauthorize Violence Against Women Act in 2013, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' published an article arguing that "[d]omestic violence is still a severely under-reported crime and some critics say mandatory arrest policies have exacerbated this problem."<ref name="nation.time.com"/> Furthermore, in Time Magazine the author concluded that "mandatory arrest laws remove the preferences of abused women from a process that can leave them financially strapped and worried that the state will take custody of their children." <ref>"[http://nation.time.com/2013/02/27/whats-wrong-with-the-violence-against-women-act/What's wrong with the violence against women act?"] TIMES. Retrieved March 20, 2014</ref>

The mandatory arrest policies were established in the original 1994 version of the Violence Against Women Act.<ref name="legcounsel.house.gov">"Violence Against Women Act of 1994 § 311 (a)(2)(c)" [https://legcounsel.house.gov/comps/domviol.pdf] Retrieved December 8, 2014</ref> These policies encouraged law enforcement to make arrests and move forward with domestic violence cases without the cooperation of victims.<ref name="legcounsel.house.gov"/> Contrary to what Time Magazine states about mandatory arrest provisions, the provisions were removed from Violence Against Women Act in 2000.<ref name="ReferenceA">Violence Against Women Act of 2000 § 104 (b).</ref>  While reviewing and reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act in 2000, Congress changed from "encourage mandatory arrest" policies to "encourage arrest" policies instead, which focus on arresting based on probable cause.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

=== Definition of violence ===
In April 2018, OVW changed its definitions of “domestic violence” and “sexual assault." Previously, under the Obama administration, OVW had recognized "forms of emotional, economic, or psychological abuse" within the definition of domestic violence, according to Natalie Nanasi of the [[Southern Methodist University]] [[Dedman School of Law]]. Now, under the Trump administration, only physical harm that could be prosecuted as a misdemeanor or felony can be considered by OVW as domestic violence. Similarly, whereas sexual assault had previously been defined by OVW as any sexual contact occurring "without the explicit consent of the recipient," now it is limited to only those acts that are already specifically prohibited by "Federal, tribal, or State law." According to Nanasi, the restrictive definitions inhibit OVW from pursuing broader policies to solve the problems of domestic violence and sexual assault.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2019/01/23/trump-administration-quietly-changes-definition-of-domestic-violence-and-sexual-assault/|title=Trump administration quietly changes definition of "domestic violence" and "sexual assault"|last=Derysh|first=Igor|date=January 23, 2019|website=Salon|language=en|access-date=January 28, 2019}}</ref>
