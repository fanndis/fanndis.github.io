The modern city also encompasses other Swedish settlements, such as Timmerön / Timber Island (along [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River tributary)|Brandywine Creek]]), Sidoland (South Wellington), Strandviken (along the [[Delaware River]] near Simonds Garden) and Översidolandet (along the [[Christina River]], near Woodcrest and Ashley Heights).

The area now known as Wilmington was settled by the [[Lenape]] (or Delaware Indian) band led by Sachem (Chief) '''Mattahorn''' just before [[Henry Hudson]] sailed up the Len-api Hanna ("People Like Me River", present [[Delaware River]]) in 1609. The area was called "Maax-waas Unk" or "Bear Place" after the Maax-waas Hanna (Bear River) that flowed by (present [[Christina River]]). It was called the Bear River because it flowed west to the "Bear People", who are now known as the People of [[Conestoga (people)|Conestoga]] or the [[Susquehannocks]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The Dutch heard and spelled the river and the place as "'''Minguannan'''." When settlers and traders from the [[Swedish South Company]] under [[Peter Minuit]] arrived in March 1638 on the ''[[Fogel Grip]]'' and ''[[Kalmar Nyckel]]'', they purchased Maax-waas Unk from Chief Mattahorn and built [[Fort Christina]] at the mouth of the Maax-waas Hanna (which the Swedes renamed the [[Christina River]] after [[Queen Christina of Sweden]]). The area was also known as "The Rocks", and is located near the foot of present-day Seventh Street. Fort Christina served as the headquarters for the colony of [[New Sweden]] which consisted of, for the most part, the lower [[Delaware River]] region (parts of present-day [[Delaware]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[New Jersey]]), but few colonists settled there.<ref name="MONROE">{{Citation |last=Munroe |first=John A.

The most important Swedish governor was Colonel [[Johan Printz]], who ruled the colony under Swedish law from 1643 to 1653. He was succeeded by [[Johan Rising]], who upon his arrival in 1654, seized the Dutch post [[Fort Casimir]], located at the site of the present town of [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]], which was built by the Dutch in 1651. Rising governed New Sweden until the autumn of 1655, when a Dutch fleet under the command of [[Peter Stuyvesant]] subjugated the Swedish forts and established the authority of the Colony of [[New Netherland]] throughout the area formerly controlled by the Swedes. This marked the end of Swedish rule in North America.

Beginning in 1664 [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]] began; after a series of wars between the [[Anglo–Dutch Wars|Dutch and English]], the area stabilized under British rule, with strong influences from the [[Quaker]] communities under the auspices of [[Proprietor]] [[William Penn]]. A [[borough]] charter was granted in 1739 by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], which changed the name of the settlement from Willington, after Thomas Willing (the first developer of the land, who organized the area in a grid pattern similar to that of its northern neighbor Philadelphia),<ref>{{Citation |last=Munroe |first=John A. |title=History of Delaware |edition=5th |page=57

Although during the [[American Revolutionary War]] only one small battle was fought in Delaware, British troops occupied Wilmington shortly after the nearby [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777. The British remained in the town until they vacated Philadelphia in 1778.

In 1800, [[Eleuthère Irénée du Pont]], a [[Huguenot|French Huguenot]], emigrated to the United States. Knowledgeable in the manufacture of [[gunpowder]], by 1802 DuPont had begun making the explosive in a mill on the Brandywine River north of [[Brandywine Village]] and just outside the town of Wilmington.<ref>{{cite web

The greatest growth in the city occurred during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Delaware, though officially remaining a member of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], was a [[Border states (American Civil War)|border state]] and divided in its support of both the Confederate and the Union causes. The war created enormous demand for goods and materials supplied by Wilmington including ships, railroad cars, gunpowder, shoes, and other war-related goods.

By 1868, Wilmington was producing more iron ships than the rest of the country combined and it rated first in the production of gunpowder and second in carriages and leather. Due to the prosperity Wilmington enjoyed during the war, city merchants and manufacturers expanded Wilmington's residential boundaries westward in the form of large homes along tree-lined streets. This movement was spurred by the first horsecar line, which was initiated in 1864 along Delaware Avenue.

[[File:Wilmington, Del. (2674627824).jpg|thumb|right|Map of Wilmington, Delaware, 1874]]

The late 19th century saw the development of the city's first comprehensive park system. [[William Poole Bancroft]], a successful Wilmington businessman influenced by the work of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], led the effort to establish open parkland in Wilmington. [[Rockford Park]] and [[Brandywine Park]] were created due to Bancroft's efforts.

Both World Wars stimulated the city's industries. Industries vital to the war effort – shipyards, steel foundries, machinery, and chemical producers – operated around the clock. Other industries produced such goods as automobiles, leather products, and clothing. In desperate need of workers more and more minorities moved to the north and settled in places like Wilmington. This led to tensions that occasionally boiled over like the [[Wilmington, Delaware race riot of 1919]].

The post-war prosperity again pushed residential development further out of the city. In the 1950s, more people began living in the suburbs of North Wilmington and commuting into the city to work. This was made possible by extensive upgrades to area roads and highways and through the construction of [[Interstate 95]], which cut through several of Wilmington's neighborhoods and accelerated the city's population decline. Urban renewal projects in the 1950s and 1960s cleared entire blocks of housing in the Center City and East Side areas.

The [[Wilmington riot of 1968]], a few days after the April 4 [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]], became national news. On April 9, Governor [[Charles L. Terry, Jr.]] deployed the [[Delaware Army National Guard|National Guard]] and the [[Delaware State Police]] to the city at the request of Mayor John Babiarz. Babiarz asked Terry to withdraw the National Guard the following week, but the governor kept them in the city until his term ended in January 1969. This is reportedly the longest occupation of an American city by state forces in the nation's history.<ref name="Boyer">{{Citation |last=Boyer |first=William W. |title=Governing Delaware: Policy Problems In The First State |access-date=May 14, 2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xN3pzLSQN8IC&pg=PA57 |format=eBook |page=57 |chapter=Chapter Three: The Governor as Leader |year=2000 |publisher=[[University of Delaware Press]] (eBook: Google) |location=Newark, Delaware |isbn=0-87413-721-7 |oclc=609154858 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xN3pzLSQN8IC&pg=PA56 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606212918/http://books.google.com/books?id=xN3pzLSQN8IC&pg=PA57 |archive-date=June 6, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the 1980s, job growth and office construction were spurred by the arrival of national banks and financial institutions in the wake of the 1981 Financial Center Development Act, which liberalized the laws governing banks operating within the state, and similar laws in 1986. Today, many national and international banks, including [[Bank of America]], [[Capital One]], [[JPMorgan Chase & Co.|Chase]], and [[Barclays]], have operations in the city, typically credit card operations.

==Geography==
[[File:Wilmington aerial.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Wilmington]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|17.0|mi2|km2}}. Of that, {{convert|10.9|mi2|km2}} is land and {{convert|6.2|mi2|km2}} is water. The total area is 36.25% water.

The city sits at the confluence of the [[Christina River]] and the [[Delaware River]], about {{convert|33|mi|km}} southwest of [[Philadelphia]]. [[Wilmington station (Delaware)|Wilmington Train Station]], one of the southernmost stops on Philadelphia's [[SEPTA]] rail transportation system, is also served by [[Northeast Corridor]] [[Amtrak]] passenger trains. Wilmington is served by [[Interstate 95 in Delaware|I-95]] and [[Interstate 495 (Delaware)|I-495]] within city limits. In addition, the twin-span [[Delaware Memorial Bridge]], a few miles south of the city, provides direct highway access between Delaware and New Jersey, carrying the [[Interstate 295 (Delaware)|I-295]] eastern bypass route around Wilmington and Philadelphia, as well as [[U.S. Route 40 in Delaware|US 40]], which continues eastward to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].

These transportation links and geographic proximity give Wilmington some of the characteristics of a [[satellite city]] to Philadelphia, but Wilmington's long history as Delaware's principal city, its urban core, and its independent value as a business destination makes it more properly considered a small but independent city in the Philadelphia [[metropolitan area]].

Wilmington lies along the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] geological transition from the [[Piedmont (United States)|Mid-Atlantic Piedmont Plateau]] to the [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]]. East of Market Street, and along both sides of the Christina River, the Coastal Plain land is flat, low-lying, and in places marshy. The Delaware River here is an [[estuary]] at sea level (with twice-daily high and low tides), providing [[sea level|sea-level]] access for ocean-going ships.

On the western side of Market Street, the Piedmont topography is rocky and hilly, rising to a point that marks the watershed between the Brandywine River and the Christina River. This watershed line runs along Delaware Avenue westward from 10th Street and Market Street.

These contrasting topography and soil conditions affected the industrial and residential development patterns within the city. The hilly west side was more attractive for the original residential areas, offering springs and sites for [[Mill (grinding)|mill]]s, better [[air quality]], and fewer [[mosquitoes]].

===Climate===
Wilmington has a warm [[temperate climate]] or [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with hot and humid summers, cool to cold winters, and precipitation evenly spread throughout the year. In July, the daily average is {{convert|76.8|°F|1}}, with an average 21 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs annually. Summer thunderstorms are common in the hottest months.  The January daily average is {{convert|32.4|°F|1}}, although temperatures may occasionally reach {{convert|10|°F|0}} or {{convert|55|°F}} as fronts move toward and past the area. Snowfall is light to moderate, and variable, with some winters bringing very little of it and others witnessing several major snowstorms; the average seasonal total is {{convert|20.2|in|cm}}. Extremes in temperature have ranged from {{convert|-15|°F|0}} on February 9, 1934, up to {{convert|107|°F|0}} on August 7, 1918, though both {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ and {{convert|0|°F|0}} readings are uncommon; the last occurrence of each was July 18, 2012 and February 5, 1996, respectively.

In the 2000s, while most cities had seen a decrease in crime and murder, Wilmington had broken its record for homicides in a single year multiple times.

The Wilmington Police Department (WPD), which aims to "raise the level of public safety through law enforcement and thereby reduce the fear and incidence of crime", is authorized to deploy up to 289 officers in motor vehicles, on foot, and on bicycle. Its operations are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies. As of 2017, its chief is Robert Tracy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wilmingtonde.gov/government/police |title=Department of Police |publisher=City of Wilmington |access-date=December 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212195923/http://www.wilmingtonde.gov/government/police |archive-date=December 12, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2002, the Wilmington Police Department started a program known to some in the neighborhoods as ''jump-outs'' in which unmarked police vans would patrol crime-prone neighborhoods late at night, suddenly converge at street corners where people were [[loitering]] and detain them temporarily. Using loitering as probable cause, the police would then photograph, search, and [[fingerprint]] everyone present. Along with apprehending anyone with drugs or weapons, it was thought that this program would improve the police's database of fingerprints and [[eye-witness]]es for use in future crime investigations. Some citizens protested that such a practice was a violation of [[civil right]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Taylor|first=Adam|date=25 August 2002|title=Wilmington police photo policy under fire|newspaper=The News Journal|publisher=The News Journal Co.|location=Wilmington, DE|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/newsjournal/local/2002/08/25wilmingtonpolic.html|url-status=dead|access-date=30 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020901111015/http://www.delawareonline.com/newsjournal/local/2002/08/25wilmingtonpolic.html|archive-date=September 1, 2002}}</ref>

===Fire department and EMS===
The Wilmington Fire Department (WFD) is led by Chief Michael Donohue and maintains five engine companies, two ladder companies, a rescue squad company, and a marine (fireboat) fire fighting force.

Emergency medical services are provided through contract with the city's St. Francis Hospital, whose EMS division operates a minimum five BLS transport units at all times of the day. Advanced Life Support services in the City of Wilmington are provided by New Castle County's EMS Division with two city-based medic units. All Wilmington firefighters since 2002 are trained to the EMT-B level and serve as first responders for life-threatening emergencies.

==Economy==
[[File:Bank Center.jpg|thumb|[[WSFS Bank]]'s headquarters in downtown Wilmington]]

Much of Wilmington's economy is based on its status as the most populous and readily accessible city in Delaware, a state that made itself attractive to corporations with business-friendly financial laws and a longstanding reputation for a fair and effective judicial system. Contributing to the economic health of the downtown and Wilmington Riverfront regions has been the presence of [[Wilmington station (Delaware)|Wilmington Station]], through which 665,000 people passed in 2009.<ref name=Taylor2010>{{Citation

Wilmington has become a national financial center for the credit card industry, largely due to regulations enacted by former [[List of Governors of Delaware|Governor]] [[Pierre S. du Pont, IV]] in 1981. The Financial Center Development Act of 1981, among other things, eliminated the [[usury]] laws enacted by most states, thereby removing the cap on interest rates that banks may legally charge customers. Major credit card issuers such as [[Barclays|Barclays Bank of Delaware]] (formerly [[Juniper Bank]]), are headquartered in Wilmington. The Dutch banking giant [[ING Groep N.V.]] headquartered its U.S. internet banking unit, [[ING Direct]] (now Capital One 360), in Wilmington. [[Wilmington Trust]] is headquartered in Wilmington at [[Rodney Square]]. Barclays and Capital One 360 have very large and prominent locations along the waterfront of the [[Christina River]]. In 1988, the Delaware legislature enacted a law which required a would-be acquirer to capture 85 percent of a Delaware chartered corporation's stock in a single transaction or wait three years before proceeding. This law strengthened Delaware's position as a safe haven for corporate charters during an especially turbulent time filled with hostile takeovers.

Wilmington's other notable industries include insurance (American Life Insurance Company [ALICO], Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Delaware), [[retail banking]] (including the Delaware headquarters of: [[Wilmington Trust]] (Now a branch of [[M&T Bank]], after Wilmington Trust merged with M&T in 2011), [[PNC Bank]], [[Wells Fargo]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[HSBC]], [[Citizens Financial Group|Citizens Bank]], [[WSFS Bank|Wilmington Savings Fund Society]], and Artisans' Bank), and legal services.

==Arts and culture==
[[File:St Anthony of Padua church 6.jpg|left|thumb|The altar and pulpit of [[St. Anthony's Roman Catholic Church (Wilmington, Delaware)|St. Anthony's Roman Catholic Church.]]]]
Wilmington has many museums, galleries, and gardens to enjoy (see Points of Interest below), as well as many ethnic festivals and other events throughout the year. Notable among its museums is the Delaware Art Museum whose collection focuses on American art and illustration from the 19th to the 21st century, and on the English Pre-Raphaelite movement of the mid-19th century.

===Ethnic festivals===
Wilmington has an active and diverse ethnic population, which contributes to several ethnic festivals held every spring and summer in Wilmington, the most popular of which is the Italian Festival. This event, run by [[St. Anthony's Roman Catholic Church (Wilmington, Delaware)|St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church]], closes down six blocks in the west side of the city the second week of June for traditional Italian music, food, and activities, along with carnival rides and games. Another, somewhat smaller festival that draws large crowds is the Greek Festival, which is organized by Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church. The event features traditional Greek (Hellenic) crafts, food, drink, and music. Another notable annual festival is the Polish festival organized by St. Hedwig's Catholic Church, which features Polish cuisine with carnival rides and entertainment. Haneef's African Festival celebrates the heritage of the African American majority in the city.<ref>{{cite book |title=State names, seals, flags, and symbols |author=Shearer, Barbara Smith |year=2002 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=0-313-31534-5 |page=258}}</ref>
Wilmington is also home to the annual [[Big August Quarterly]], which since 1814 has celebrated African American religious freedom. IndiaFest, another cultural festival, is hosted by the Indo American Association of Delaware.<ref>{{cite web| title = Indiafest 2009| work = IAAD- Indo American Association of Delaware| url = http://www.iaadelaware.org/| access-date = December 1, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090831131034/http://www.iaadelaware.org/| archive-date = August 31, 2009| url-status = live}}</ref>
Wilmington also celebrates Hispanic Week, which coincides with National Hispanic Month festivities, September 15 – October 15. The festival culminates with a pageant and desfile (parade) along 4th Street. Concerts featuring Latin music acts, Latin cuisine and a carnival are held on the Riverfront on the last weekend. Activities are also held at St. Paul's Catholic Church.

===Music festivals===
The [[Clifford Brown Jazz Festival]] is a week-long outdoor music festival held each summer in Wilmington's [[Rodney Square]].

The ''Peoples' Festival'' is an annual tribute to [[Bob Marley]], who once lived in Wilmington trying to earn money enough to establish his Tuff Gong music studio in Kingston, Jamaica. His son [[Stephen Marley (musician)|Stephen Marley]] was born in Wilmington 1972. Started in 1994, the Peoples' Festival features [[reggae]] and [[world beat]] musicians playing original music and [[Bob Marley and the Wailers]] songs. The festival is held on the Wilmington riverfront each summer.

The ''Riverfront Blues Festival'', a 3-day music festival held each August in the Tubman-Garrett Riverfront Park, features prominent blues acts as well as artists from the local area.

==Wilmington Riverfront==
[[File:Wilmington Riverfront.JPG|thumb|right|The ''Kalmar Nyckel'' with the Wilmington skyline in the background]]
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2011}}
In the 1990s, the city launched a campaign to revitalize the former shipyard area known as the Wilmington Riverfront. Delaware Theatre Company was at the forefront of this movement, opening its current space on Water Street in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.delawaretheatre.org/about_history |title=History of the Delaware Theatre Company |publisher=Delaware Theatre Company |access-date=January 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628230045/http://www.delawaretheatre.org/about_history |archive-date=June 28, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The efforts were bolstered early by The Big Kahuna also known as Kahunaville (a restaurant, bar and arcade which has also since closed and been rebuilt in 2010 as the Delaware Children's Museum) and [[Daniel S. Frawley Stadium]], the [[Wilmington Blue Rocks]] minor league baseball stadium. The [[Chase Center on the Riverfront]] opened as the First USA Riverfront Arts Center in 1998 to hold traveling exhibitions, but was repurposed into the city's [[convention center]] in 2005. The [[Wilmington Rowing Center]] boathouse is located along the Christina River on the Riverfront. Development continues as the Wilmington Riverfront tries to establish its cultural, economical, and residential importance. Recent high-rise luxury apartment buildings along the [[Christina River]] have been cited as evidence of the Riverfront's continued revival. On June 7, 2006, the groundbreaking of Justison Landing signaled the beginning of Wilmington's largest residential project since Bancroft Park was built after World War II. Outlets shops, restaurants and a Riverfront Market have also opened along the {{convert|1.2|mi|km|adj=on}} Riverwalk.

==Education==
Wilmington is served by the [[Brandywine School District|Brandywine]], [[Christina School District|Christina]], and [[Red Clay Consolidated School District|Red Clay]] school districts for elementary, junior high, and high school public education. The [[New Castle County Vocational-Technical School District]] operates [[Howard High School of Technology]] in the city of Wilmington.

In 1954, the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] forced the then segregated schools of New Castle County to desegregate. However, the subsequent eleven school districts that were created in the county, including the Wilmington School District, soon became de facto segregated, as the Wilmington School District became predominately black, and the districts outside the city remained overwhelmingly white. In response, the 1976 U.S. District Court decision [[Evans v. Buchanan]] implemented a plan by which students in Wilmington would be bused to attend school in the suburbs for certain grades, while suburban students would be [[Desegregation busing in the United States|bused]] into the City of Wilmington for other grades. By 1981, the four current districts in northern New Castle County, Brandywine, Christina, [[Colonial School District (Delaware)|Colonial]], and Red Clay, each composed of city and suburban areas, were established. However, Colonial School District no longer serves any portion of the city of Wilmington.

There are many private elementary and secondary schools in Wilmington:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.privateschoolreview.com/county_private_schools/stateid/DE/county/10003|title=New Castle County, DE Private Schools - PrivateSchoolReview.com|work=privateschoolreview.com|access-date=December 20, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221003601/http://www.privateschoolreview.com/county_private_schools/stateid/DE/county/10003|archive-date=December 21, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Salesianum|Salesianum School]], [[Serviam Girls Academy]], Nativity Preparatory of Wilmington,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nativitywilmington.org/|title=Nativity Preparatory School of Wilmington|access-date=December 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007130024/http://nativitywilmington.org/|archive-date=October 7, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Ursuline Academy (Delaware)|Ursuline Academy]], [[Wilmington Friends School]], [[The Tatnall School]], [[Tower Hill School]], [[St. Elizabeth High School (Delaware)|St. Elizabeth High School]], and [[Padua Academy]].

The Charter School of Wilmington and Cab Calloway School of the Arts are housed in the building of the former Wilmington High School. Great Oaks Charter School and Kuumba Academy are housed in the Community Education Building (a/k/a "C.E.B"), formerly known as Bracebridge IV, acquired by Bank of America from MBNA Corp. in 1997 and donated to  The Longwood Foundation in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cebde.org/our-journey-in-time.html|title=Our Journey In Time|website=Community Education Building|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329120737/http://www.cebde.org/our-journey-in-time.html|archive-date=March 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
