In [[Politics of the United States|American politics]], a '''superdelegate''' is an '''unpledged delegate''' to the [[Democratic National Convention]] who is seated automatically and chooses for themselves for whom they vote. These [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] superdelegates (who make up slightly under 15% of all convention [[Delegate (American politics)|delegate]]s) include party leaders and elected officials (PLEOs).

Democratic superdelegates are free to support any candidate for the presidential nomination. This contrasts with pledged delegates who are selected based on the [[Political parties|party]] [[primary election|primaries]] and [[caucus]]es in each [[U.S. state]], in which voters choose among candidates for the party's [[President of the United States|presidential]] [[nomination]]. On August 25, 2018, the Democratic National Committee agreed to reduce the influence of superdelegates by generally preventing them from voting on the first ballot at the Democratic National Convention, allowing their votes only in a contested nomination.<ref>{{cite news |last=Herndon |first=Astead W. |date=August 25, 2018 |title=Democrats Overhaul Controversial Superdelegate System |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/us/politics/superdelegates-democrats-dnc.html |accessdate=August 26, 2018 }}</ref>

At least in name, superdelegates are not involved in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination process. There are delegates to the [[Republican National Convention]] who are seated automatically, but they are limited to three per state, consisting of the state chairman and two district-level committee members. Republican Party superdelegates are obliged to vote for their state's popular vote winner under the rules of the party branch to which they belong.<ref name="WashingtonExaminer20160210"/>

Although the term ''superdelegate'' was originally coined and created to describe a type of Democratic delegate, the term has become widely used to describe these delegates in both parties.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Marcus | first = Ruth | title = Looking Beyond Tsunami Tuesday | work = [[The Sacramento Bee]] | date = January 17, 2008 | url = http://www.sacbee.com/110/v-print/story/640529.html | archive-url = https://archive.today/20080610145850/http://www.sacbee.com/110/v-print/story/640529.html | archive-date = June 10, 2008 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> However, it is not an official term used by either party.

For Republicans, there are three delegates in each state, consisting of the state chairman and two [[Republican National Committee]] committee members, who are automatic delegates to the national convention. However, according to the RNC communications director Sean Spicer, convention rules obligate these RNC members to vote according to the result of primary elections held in their states, if the state holds a primary.<ref name="WashingtonExaminer20160210">{{Cite web|title = Can GOP 'superdelegates' stop Trump?|url = http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/can-gop-superdelegates-stop-trump/article/2580289|website = Washington Examiner|access-date = February 10, 2016}}</ref>

== Comparison with pledged delegates ==
''Unpledged'' PLEO (party leaders and elected officials) delegates should not be confused with ''pledged'' PLEO delegates; Democratic Party rules distinguish pledged and unpledged delegates. Pledged delegates are selected based on their announced preferences in the contest for the presidential nomination. In the [[Political party|party]] [[primary election]]s and [[caucus]]es in each U.S. state, voters [[first past the post voting|express their preference]] among the contenders for the party's nomination for [[President of the United States]]. Pledged delegates supporting each candidate are chosen in approximate ratio to their candidate's share of the vote. They fall into three categories: district-level pledged delegates (usually by [[congressional district]]s), at-large pledged delegates, and pledged PLEO delegates. In a minority of the states, delegates are legally required to support the candidate to whom they are pledged.<ref>{{cite news| last = Sinderbrand| first = Rebecca | title =Pledged delegates up for grabs, Clinton says| publisher = CNNPolitics.com| date = March 26, 2008| url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/26/clinton.delegates/| accessdate =June 11, 2008}}</ref> In addition to the states' requirements, the party rules state (Rule 12.J): "Delegates elected to the national convention pledged to a presidential candidate shall in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them."<ref name="Dem rules"/>

By contrast, the unpledged PLEO delegates (Rule 9.A) are seated without regard to their presidential preferences, solely by virtue of being current or former elected officeholders and party officials. Many of them have chosen to announce endorsements, but they are not bound in any way. They may support any candidate they wish, including one who has dropped out of the presidential race.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Romney suspends presidential campaign | newspaper = CNN.com | date = February 7, 2008| url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/02/07/romney.campaign/index.html }}</ref>

Under Rule 9.C, the pledged PLEO slots are allocated to candidates based on the results of the primaries and caucuses.<ref name="Dem rules"/> Another difference between pledged PLEOs and unpledged PLEOs is that there is a fixed number of pledged PLEO slots for each state, while the number of unpledged PLEOs can change during the campaign. Pledged PLEO delegates are not generally considered superdelegates.

== Origins ==
After the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], at which pro-[[Vietnam War]] liberal [[Hubert Humphrey]] was nominated for the presidency despite not running in a single [[primary election]], the Democratic Party made changes in its delegate selection process to correct what was seen as "illusory" control of the nomination process by primary voters.<ref name=Marcetic21>Branko Marcetic, "The Secret History of Super Delegates," ''In These Times,'' vol. 40, no. 6 (June 2016), pg. 21.</ref> A commission headed by [[South Dakota]] senator [[George McGovern]] and [[Minnesota]] representative [[Donald M. Fraser]] met in 1969 and 1970 to make the composition of the Democratic Party's nominating convention less subject to control by party leaders and more responsive to the votes cast in primary elections.

The rules implemented by the [[McGovern-Fraser Commission]] shifted the balance of power to primary elections and caucuses, mandating that all delegates be chosen via mechanisms open to all party members.<ref name=Marcetic21 /> As a result of this change the number of primaries more than doubled over the next three presidential election cycles, from 17 in 1968 to 35 in 1980.<ref name=Marcetic21 /> Despite the radically increased level of primary participation, with 32 million voters taking part in the selection process by 1980, the Democrats proved largely unsuccessful at the ballot box, with the 1972 presidential campaign of McGovern and the 1980 re-election campaign of [[Jimmy Carter]] resulting in landslide defeats.<ref name=Marcetic21 /> Democratic Party affiliation skidded from 41 percent of the electorate at the time of the McGovern-Fraser Commission report to just 31 percent in the aftermath of the 1980 electoral debacle.<ref name=Marcetic21 />

Further soul-searching took place among party leaders, who argued that the pendulum had swung too far in the direction of primary elections over insider decision-making, with one May 1981 California white paper declaring that the Democratic Party had "lost its leadership, collective vision and ties with the past," resulting in the nomination of unelectable candidates.<ref name=Marcetic22>Marcetic, "The Secret History of Super Delegates," pg. 22.</ref> A new 70-member commission headed by [[Governor of North Carolina]] [[Jim Hunt]] was appointed to further refine the Democratic Party's nomination process, attempting to balance the wishes of rank-and-file Democrats with the collective wisdom of party leaders and to thereby avoid the nomination of insurgent candidates exemplified by the liberal McGovern or the anti-Washington conservative Carter and lessening the potential influence of [[single-issue politics]] in the selection process.<ref name=Marcetic22 />

Following a series of meetings held from August 1981 to February 1982, the Hunt Commission issued a report which recommended the setting aside of unelected and unpledged delegate slots for Democratic members of Congress and for state party chairs and vice chairs (so-called "superdelegates").<ref name=Marcetic22 /> With the original Hunt plan, superdelegates were to represent 30% of all delegates to the national convention, but when it was finally implemented by the [[Democratic National Committee]] for the 1984 election, the number of superdelegates was set {{nowrap|at 14%.<ref name=wpdsbj82>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L09OAAAAIBAJ&pg=6993%2C5631446 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=(Washington Post) |last=Broder |first=David S. |author-link=David S. Broder |title=Major turnaround by the Democratic Party |date=January 15, 1982 |page=8}}</ref>}} Over time this percentage has gradually increased, until by 2008 the percentage stood at approximately 20% of total delegates to the Democratic Party nominating convention.<ref name="cqweekly">{{Cite news|last=Nather |first=David |title=Leaping Voters In a Single Bound |newspaper=[[Congressional Quarterly|CQ Weekly]] |pages=482 |date=February 25, 2008 |url=http://public.cq.com/docs/cqw/weeklyreport110-000002675899.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127130726/http://public.cq.com/docs/cqw/weeklyreport110-000002675899.html |archive-date=November 27, 2008 }}</ref>

==DNC Unity Reform Commission and superdelegate reform, 2016–2018==
On July 23, 2016, ahead of the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]], the 2016 DNC Rules Committee voted overwhelmingly (158–6) to adopt a superdelegate reform package. The new rules were the result of a compromise between the [[Hillary Clinton]] and the [[Bernie Sanders]] presidential campaigns; in the past, Sanders had pressed for the complete elimination of superdelegates.<ref name="Weigel">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/07/23/democrats-vote-to-bind-most-superdelegates-to-state-primary-results/|title=Democrats vote to bind most superdelegates to state primary results|newspaper=The Washington Post|last=Weigel|first=David|date=July 23, 2016|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref>

Under the reform package, in future Democratic Conventions, about two-thirds of superdelegates would be bound to the results of state primaries and [[caucus]]es. The remaining one-third—members of Congress, governors, and distinguished party leaders—would remain unpledged and free to support the candidate of their choice.<ref name="Weigel"/>

Under the reform package, a 21-member unity commission, chaired by Clinton supporter Jennifer O'Malley Dillon and vice-chaired by Sanders supporter [[Larry Cohen (union leader)|Larry Cohen]], was appointed after the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 general election]]. The commission's recommendations would be voted on at the next Democratic National Committee meeting, well before the beginning of the 2020 Democratic primaries.<ref name="Weigel"/> The commission was to consider "a mix of Clinton and Sanders ideas": expanding the ability of eligible voters to participate in caucuses (an idea supported by Clinton) and expanding the ability of unaffiliated or new voters to join the Democratic Party and vote in Democratic primaries via [[Same-day voter registration|same-day registration and re-registration]] (an idea supported by Sanders).<ref name="Weigel"/> The commission drew comparisons to the [[McGovern–Fraser Commission]], which established party primary reforms before the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]].<ref name="Weigel"/>

By April 2017, the complete committee had been appointed. In accordance with the compromise agreement, the 21 members include, in addition to O'Malley Dillon and Cohen; nine members selected by Clinton, seven selected by Sanders, and three selected by the DNC chair ([[Tom Perez]]).<ref>Daniel Marans, [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dnc-unity-reform-commission_us_58f50d1fe4b0b9e9848d92eb DNC Announces Members Of Unity Reform Commission], ''Huffington Post'' (April 17, 2017).</ref> By May 2017, the DNC Unity Reform Commission had begun to meet to begin drafting reforms, including superdelegate reform as well as primary calendar and caucus reform.<ref>Alex Roarty, [http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article149164704.html Beyond Trump, Democrats are bitterly divided], McClatchy DC (May 7, 2017).</ref>

In a series of meetings in the summer and fall of 2017, the Unity Commission "considered various proposals for dealing with superdelegates — including automatically binding their votes to their states' choice" but the issue of whether to abolish superdelegates altogether remained controversial within the party.<ref name="Debenedetti">Gabriel Debenedetti, [https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/15/tim-kaine-end-superdelegates-244944 Kaine calls for eliminating superdelegates: Hillary Clinton’s VP sides with Bernie Sanders in a fight that’s divided Democrats], ''Politico'' (November 15, 2017).</ref> In December 2017, the Unity Commission's recommendations <ref>O'Malley Dillon, Jen, and Cohen, Larry.

==Superdelegates in practice==
===1984 election===

In 1984, only state party chairs and vice chairs were guaranteed superdelegate status. The remaining spots were divided two ways. Democratic members of Congress were allowed to select up to 60% of their members to fill some of these spots. The remaining positions were left to the state parties to fill with priority given to governors and big-city mayors, led by Democrats and based on population.

In the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 election]], the major contenders for the presidential nomination were [[Gary Hart]], [[Jesse Jackson]], and [[Walter Mondale]]. Entering the final handful of primaries on June 5, Mondale was leading Hart in the delegate count, with Jackson far behind. The battle for delegates became more dramatic that night when Hart won three primaries, including the big prize of California in a cliffhanger. The Mondale campaign said, and some news reports agreed, that Mondale secured the needed 1,967 delegates to clinch the nomination that night in spite of losing California. But the [[Associated Press]] concluded he was "barely short of the magic majority." Mondale wanted to make it indisputable that he had enough delegate votes, and his campaign set a deadline of one minute before noon; he made 50 calls in three hours to nail down an additional 40 superdelegates and declared at a press conference that he had 2,008 delegate votes. At [[1984 Democratic National Convention|the convention]] in July, Mondale won on the first ballot.<ref name=Berman>{{Cite news | last = Berman | first = Ari | title = Not So Superdelegates | work = [[The Nation]] | date = February 18, 2008 | url = https://www.thenation.com/article/not-so-superdelegates/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1345&dat=19840606&id=aVdOAAAAIBAJ&pg=5968,1105065&hl=en|title=Mondale loses California, but near majority|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=June 6, 1984|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19840608&id=I31WAAAAIBAJ&pg=6138,3741353&hl=en|title=Mondale claims win; Hart fights on|newspaper=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=June 7, 1984|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/06/07/democrats-rally-to-bid-by-mondale/992c7f80-ce95-4bb4-84ae-3d857a88b423/|title=Democrats rally to bid by Mondale|newspaper=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=June 7, 1984|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/06/07/calls-yield-delegates-to-mondale/bb6112f3-9748-4c2e-ae52-b04e515b9918/|title=Calls yield delegates to Mondale|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=June 7, 1984|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}</ref>

===1988 election===

In 1988, this process was simplified. Democrats in Congress were now allowed to select up to 80% of their members. All Democratic National Committee members and all Democratic governors were given superdelegate status. This year also saw the addition of the ''distinguished party leader'' category (although former DNC chairs were not added to this category until 1996, and former House and Senate minority leaders were not added until 2000). In 1992 was the addition of a category of unpledged "add-ons", a fixed number of spots allocated to the states, intended for other party leaders and elected officials not already covered by the previous categories. Finally, beginning in 1996, all Democratic members of Congress were given superdelegate status.<ref name="TerryMichael">Terry Michael, [http://terrymichael.net/PDF%20Files/DNC_PrezNomProcess.pdf The Democratic Party's Presidential Nominating Process] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528190503/http://terrymichael.net/PDF%20Files/DNC_PrezNomProcess.pdf |date=May 28, 2008 }}. March 2004 (pages 14-15)</ref>

The superdelegates have not always prevailed, however. In the Democratic primary phase of the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 election]], [[Howard Dean]] acquired an early lead in delegate counts by obtaining the support of a number of superdelegates before even the first primaries were held.<ref>{{cite web| last1 = Lynch| first1 = Dotty |first2=Beth |last2=Lester | title = Dean Leads 'Superdelegate' Count | publisher = [[CBS News]]| date = January 17, 2004| url = https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/17/politics/main593845.shtml | accessdate =May 18, 2008}}</ref> Nevertheless, [[John Kerry]] defeated Dean in a succession of primaries and caucuses and won the nomination.

In 1988, a study found that superdelegates and delegates selected through the primary and caucus process are not substantively different in terms of viewpoints on issues from each other. However, superdelegates are more likely to prefer candidates with Washington experience than outsider candidates.<ref>Richard Herrerra, "Are 'Superdelegates' Super?" ''Political Behavior,'' vol. 16, no. 1. (March 1994), pp. 79-92.</ref>

===2008 election===
{{main|List of Democratic Party superdelegates, 2008}}

At the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]], the superdelegates made up approximately one-fifth of the total number of delegates. The closeness of the race between the leading contenders, [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]], led to speculation that the superdelegates would play a decisive role in selecting the nominee, a prospect that caused unease among some Democratic Party leaders.<ref>{{cite news |title=Neck and Neck, Democrats Woo Superdelegates |work=The New York Times |first=Adam |last=Nagourney |author2=Hulse, Carl  |date=February 10, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/us/politics/10superdelegates.html?scp=2&sq=superdelegates&st=nyt }}</ref> Obama, however, won a majority of the pledged delegates<ref>{{Cite news| last = Seelye| first = Katharine Q.| title = For Clinton, a Key Group Didn't Hold| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| date = June 5, 2008| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/05/us/politics/05superdelegates.html?emc=eta1}}</ref> and of the superdelegates, and thus clinched the Democratic presidential nomination by June.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://demconwatch.blogspot.com/2008/02/superdelegates-by-position.html |title=Superdelegates by Position |publisher=Democratic Convention Watch |date=June 7, 2008 |accessdate=June 30, 2008}}</ref>

At the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]], superdelegates cast approximately 823.5 votes, with fractions arising because superdelegates from [[Michigan]], [[Florida]], and [[Democrats Abroad]] are entitled to half a vote each. Of the superdelegates' votes, 745 were from unpledged PLEO delegates and 78.5 were from unpledged add-on delegates.

There was no fixed number of unpledged PLEO delegates. The number was allowed to change during the campaign as particular individuals gained or lost qualification under a particular category. The unpledged PLEO delegates were: all Democratic members of the [[United States Congress]], Democratic [[Governor (United States)|governors]], members of the [[Democratic National Committee]], "[a]ll former Democratic presidents, all former Democratic vice presidents, all former Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate, all former Democratic speakers of the U.S. House of Representatives and Democratic minority leaders, as applicable, and all former chairs of the Democratic National Committee."

There was an exception, however, for otherwise qualified individuals who endorse another party's candidate for President; under Rule 9.A, they lose their superdelegate status.<ref name="Dem rules">{{cite web| last = Democratic National Committee | author-link = Democratic National Committee| title = Delegate Selection Rules for the 2008 Democratic National Convention| date = August 19, 2006 | url = http://s3.amazonaws.com/apache.3cdn.net/3e5b3bfa1c1718d07f_6rm6bhyc4.pdf | accessdate =February 8, 2008}}</ref> In 2008, Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] of [[Connecticut]] endorsed Republican [[John McCain]], which, according to the chairwoman of the Connecticut Democratic Party, resulted in his disqualification as a superdelegate.<ref>{{cite web| last = Pazniokas| first = Mark | title =Lieberman No Longer a Super Delegate| publisher = courant.com| date = February 6, 2008| url = http://blogs.courant.com/capitol_watch/2008/02/lieberman-no-lo.html| archive-url = https://archive.today/20080208045825/http://blogs.courant.com/capitol_watch/2008/02/lieberman-no-lo.html| url-status = dead| archive-date = February 8, 2008| access-date =February 7, 2008 }}</ref> Lieberman's status had, however, previously been questioned because, although he was a registered Democratic voter and caucused with the Democrats, he won re-election as the candidate of the [[Connecticut for Lieberman]] Party and was listed as an "Independent Democrat".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.courant.com/capitol_watch/2008/02/obama-leads-cli.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210084217/http://blogs.courant.com/capitol_watch/2008/02/obama-leads-cli.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 10, 2008|title=CAPITOL WATCH: Obama leads Clinton, 6-1, Among CT Superdelegates|newspaper=Hartford Courant|first=Mark|last=Pazniokas|date=February 8, 2008|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}</ref> The count for Connecticut's delegates in the state party's delegate selection plan, issued before his endorsement of McCain, reportedly excluded Lieberman,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctdems.org/documents/2008planv4FINAL.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-03-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509121826/http://www.ctdems.org/documents/2008planv4FINAL.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://demconwatch.blogspot.com/2008/02/everybody-wrong-on-lieberman.html |title=2008 Democratic Convention Watch: Everybody wrong on Lieberman superdelegate status |publisher=Demconwatch.blogspot.com |date=February 22, 2008 |accessdate=August 22, 2009}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=August 2009}} and he was not included on at least one list of PLEO delegates prepared before his endorsement.<ref>{{cite news| last = Office of Party Affairs and Delegate Selection| title = Unpledged PLEO Delegates -- by state| date = January 7, 2008| url = http://graphics.boston.com/multimedia/politics/2008/superdelegate_list/superdeleg.pdf | accessdate =May 17, 2008 | work=The Boston Globe}}</ref> In the end, he was not a superdelegate and did not attend the Democratic Convention; he was instead a speaker at the Republican Convention.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bolton|first1=Alexander|title=Both party conventions snub Lieberman|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/241157-both-parties-snub-onetime-convention-star-lieberman|accessdate=March 27, 2016|date=July 31, 2012}}</ref>

The exact number of superdelegates changed several times because of events. For example, the number decreased as a result of the death of Representative [[Tom Lantos]], the move from Maine to Florida of former Maine governor [[Kenneth M. Curtis]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demconwatch.blogspot.com/2008/02/superdelegate-from-maine-moves-to-fl.html |title=2008 Democratic Convention Watch: Superdelegate from Maine moves to Florida - Superdelegate total now 794 |publisher=Demconwatch.blogspot.com |date=February 28, 2008 |accessdate=August 22, 2009}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2009}} and the resignation of [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Eliot Spitzer]].

The biggest change came on May 31 as a result of the meeting of the national party's Rules and Bylaws Committee, which lessened the penalty initially imposed on Michigan and Florida. The party had excluded all delegates (including superdelegates) from either state. The Rules and Bylaws Committee voted to seat all these superdelegates (as well as the pledged delegates from those states) but with half a vote each.<ref>{{Cite news| last1 = Seelye| first1 = Katharine Q.| last2 =Zeleny | first2 = Jeff| title = Democrats Approve Deal on Michigan and Florida| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| date = June 1, 2008| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/us/politics/01rules.html?ex=1213416000&en=f855698aff1d9c98&ei=5070&emc=eta1}}</ref> That action added 55 superdelegates with 27.5 votes. The total number of superdelegates could continue to change until the beginning of the convention (Call to the Convention Section IV(C)(2)). On August 24, the Democratic Party, at the request of Obama, awarded delegates from Michigan and Florida full voting rights.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yellin |first1=Jessica |last2=Sinderbrand |first2=Rebecca |title=Clinton likely to release her delegates to Obama |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/24/democrats.convention/ |access-date=March 27, 2016 |agency=CNN.Com |date=August 25, 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830174434/http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/24/democrats.convention/ |archive-date=August 30, 2008 }}</ref>

Pledged delegates from state caucuses and primaries eventually numbered 3,573, casting 3,566 votes, resulting in a total number of delegate votes of 4,419. A candidate needed a majority of that total, or 2,209, to win the nomination. Superdelegates accounted for approximately one fifth (19.6%) of all votes at the convention and delegates chosen in the Democratic caucuses and primaries accounted for approximately four-fifths (80.4%) of the Democratic convention delegates.<ref name="NYT">{{Cite news | title = The Primary Season: 2008 Democratic Calendar | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = January 7, 2007 | url = http://politics.nytimes.com/election-guide/2008/primaries/democraticprimaries/index.html }}</ref><ref name="cnnscorecard">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/scorecard/ |title=Election Center 2008: Delegate Scorecard |work=CNN }}</ref> At the convention, Obama won 3,188.5 delegate votes and Hillary Clinton won 1,010.5 with 1 abstention and 218 delegates not voting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.demconvention.com/roll-call-results/ |title=2008 Democratic National Convention Roll Call Results |date=August 2, 2008 |access-date=August 2, 2008 |publisher=Democratic National Convention Committee|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080903201153/http://www.demconvention.com/roll-call-results/ |archive-date = September 3, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the Republican Party, as in the Democratic Party, members of the party's national committee automatically become delegates without being pledged to any candidate. In 2008, there were 123 members of the [[Republican National Committee]] among the total of 2,380 delegates to the [[2008 Republican National Convention]].<ref name="cnnscorecard" /> There are three RNC delegates (the national committeeman, national committeewoman, and state party chair) for each state.<ref>{{cite web| last = Republican National Committee| author-link = Republican National Committee| title = "Call for the 2008 Republican National Convention" (Rule 13(2))| date = November 9, 2007| url = http://www.gop.com/images/2008_Call_FINAL.pdf| access-date = May 17, 2008| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071204165509/http://www.gop.com/images/2008_Call_FINAL.pdf| archive-date = December 4, 2007| df = mdy-all}}</ref>

===2016 election===
{{main|List of Democratic Party superdelegates, 2016}}

On February 12, 2016, [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]], chair of the [[Democratic National Committee]], was asked by [[CNN]]'s [[Jake Tapper]], "What do you tell voters who are new to the process who say this makes them feel like it's all rigged?" Schultz's response was, "Unpledged delegates exist really to make sure that party leaders and elected officials don't have to be in a position where they are running against grass-roots activists . . . And so we separate out those unpledged delegates to make sure that there isn't competition between them."<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/12/we-need-more-questions-like-this-one-from-jake-tapper-to-debbie-wasserman-schultz-video/ "We need more questions like this one from Jake Tapper to Debbie Wasserman Schultz"], ''The Washington Post''</ref> This statement was hailed by Clinton supporters as a wise policy to maintain steady, experienced governance, and derided by [[Bernie Sanders]]' supporters as the establishment thwarting the will of the people.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Strauss|first1=Daniel|title=Sanders supporters revolt against superdelegates|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/bernie-sanders-superdelegates-democrats-219286|website=Politico|accessdate=March 9, 2016|ref=SandersSupportersSuperdelegates}}</ref>

Several mainstream media outlets included superdelegates in the candidate delegate totals during the primary elections although superdelegates do not actually vote until the Democratic convention and may change their minds on whom they are planning to vote for anytime before the convention. The Democratic National Committee eventually publicly instructed media outlets to not include them in primary delegate totals.<ref>{{cite news| last = Abramson | first = Seth | title = The National Media Has Been Instructed By the DNC Not to Count superdelegates, So Why Have They Refused? | newspaper = Huffington Post | date = March 2, 2016 | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/seth-abramson/the-national-media-has-be_b_9364170.html }}</ref> Nevertheless, many outlets, including the Associated Press, NBC, CBS, and Politico, continued to report the candidate delegate totals by lumping the superdelegates into the totals, inflating Hillary Clinton's lead by over 400 delegates.<ref>{{cite news| last = Abramson| first = Seth| title = Clinton Delegate Lead Down to 194, Even as Dramatic Miscounting of Delegates by Media Continues| newspaper = Huffington Post | date = Apr 18, 2016 | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/seth-abramson/clintons-delegate-lead-do_b_9711160.html }}</ref> Critics alleged that this created a perception of insurmountability<ref>{{cite news| last = Marcetic| first = Branko| title = The Secret History of Superdelegates| newspaper = Moyers| date = May 20, 2016 | url=http://billmoyers.com/story/secret-history-superdelegates/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last = Ryan | first = Shane | title = The AP Announcing Clinton's "Victory" Was an Embarrassment to Journalism and U.S. Politics | magazine = Paste Magazine  | date = June 7, 2016| url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/06/the-ap-announcing-clintons-victory-was-an-embarras.html }}</ref> and that it was done in order to discourage would-be Sanders supporters.<ref>{{cite news | last = Phillips | first = Amber | title = How Maine Democrats just voted to abolish superdelegates | newspaper = Washington Post | date = May 9, 2016 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/14/one-bernie-sanders-supporter-thinks-she-has-a-way-to-fix-the-superdelegate-process/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Ryan  | first = Shane | title = After Sanders' Big Win in New Hampshire, Establishment Figures Want to Scare You with Superdelegates.

===2020 election===
{{main|List of 2020 Democratic Party automatic delegates}}

This will be the first election with the [[#DNC Unity Reform Commission and superdelegate reform, 2016–2018|2016–2018 superdelegate reform measures]]. Under these new rules, superdelegates cannot vote on the first presidential nominating ballot, unless a candidate via the outcome of primaries and caucuses already has gained enough votes (more than 50% of all delegate votes) among only the elected pledged delegates. Superdelegates may vote in subsequent ballots when it becomes a [[Brokered convention|contested convention]] in which the pledged delegate vote alone is insufficient to determine the nominee. This does not preclude superdelegates from publicly endorsing a candidate of their choosing before the convention.<ref name="GPdelegates">{{cite web |title=The Green Papers |url=https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/D |accessdate=March 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306235014/https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/D |archive-date=March 6, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="ConventionVotes">{{cite web|url=https://frontloading.blogspot.com/2019/05/magic-number-determining-winning-number.html|title=Magic Number?

[[Susan Estrich]] argued that these delegates would have more power than other delegates because of their greater freedom to vote as they wish beginning with the first ballot.<ref name="Karmack">{{Cite news| last = Karmack| first = Elaine| title = A History of 'Super-Delegates' in the Democratic Party| newspaper =[[John F.

Delegates chosen in primaries and caucuses do not precisely reflect the votes cast, but Democratic Party rules require [[Proportional representation|proportional allocation]] of delegates rather than the plurality winner of a state primary or caucus taking all of the delegates ('winner-take-all').<ref name="Cook">{{Cite book | title = The Presidential Nominating Process: A Place for Us? | last=Cook| first=Rhodes | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1Lld7J5tZuwC&q=the+creation+of+superdelegate+slots  | publisher=Rowman & Littlefield | isbn = 978-0-7425-2594-8  | year = 2004}}</ref>

Criticism against the Democratic Party's use of superdelegates also came in November 2017 from [[Tim Kaine]], Hillary Clinton's former running mate in the 2016 U.S. national election and the junior U.S. senator from Virginia. On November 15, 2017, Kaine stated that he had sent a letter to [[Tom Perez]], the current DNC Chairman, criticizing the use of the superdelegate system; in general agreement with the junior U.S. senator from Vermont and 2016 Democratic primary challenger [[Bernie Sanders]], with Kaine stating that "I have long believed there should be no superdelegates.
