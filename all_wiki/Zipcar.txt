On March 14, 2013, Avis Budget Group acquired Zipcar for approximately {{USD|500}} million. [[Scott Griffith]], who had run the company for the previous 10 years, resigned the day after the acquisition closed and passed the reins to a new company president, Mark Norman.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/business/2013/03/uh-oh-zipcars-ceo-stepped-down-right-after-its-merger-avis/63171/

==History==
[[File:London 01 2013 Zip van 5534.JPG|thumb|Zipvan vehicle in London]]
Zipcar was co-founded by Antje Danielson and [[Robin Chase]] based on existing German and Swiss companies in January 2000. In June 2000, the first Zipcars hit the road around [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. In January 2001, Antje was fired after Robin Chase petitioned Zipcar's board for the ability to make hiring and firing decisions without consulting them.<ref name="Duhaime-Ross">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/1/5553910/driven-how-zipcars-founders-built-and-lost-a-car-sharing-empire|title=Driven: how Zipcar's founders built and lost a car-sharing empire|last=Duhaime-Ross|first=Arielle|date=April 1, 2014}}</ref> 

In September 2001, the [[Washington, D.C.]] office opened, with the branch in [[New York City]] following in February 2002. In February 2003, after difficulties in securing additional rounds of funding, the Zipcar board replaced [[Robin Chase]] as CEO with [[Scott Griffith]].<ref name="Duhaime-Ross"/>  In July 2005, Zipcar secured $10 million in funding led by [[Benchmark Capital]]. In August 2005, [[San Francisco]] office opened. In May 2006, the [[Toronto]] office opened. In May 2006, [[General Electric]]'s Commercial Finance Fleet Services ({{nyse2|GE}}) gave Zipcar $20 million in lease line financing. In September 2006, Toronto market was named fastest growing new market in company history. 

In November 2006, [[London]] office opened. In April 2007, [[Vancouver]] office opened. In October 2007, Zipcar and [[Flexcar]] executives announced a merger of the two companies, with the Zipcar brand and headquarters replacing that of Flexcar.<ref name="Seattle Times 31OCT07">{{cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003984391_flexcar31.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071031223700/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003984391_flexcar31.html |archive-date=31 October 2007 |last=Gates |first=Dominic | title=Seattle's Flexcar merges with rival Zipcar| newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]| date=31 October 2007| accessdate=9 September 2020}}</ref>

Zipcar saw a significant swing in demand during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], with a falloff in demand in March 2020 and a surge in May. Having taken cars off the road, the company had trouble keeping up with demand, causing a backlog at the customer service center.<ref name="confronts">[https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/08/11/business/zipcar-confronts-surge-interest-after-lockdowns-eased/ Zipcar confronts surge in interest after lockdowns eased]</ref> Some customers arrived at the time of their reservation to find no car in the parking spot.

Zipcar was sued in 2009 and again in 2011<ref>{{cite news|title= Zipcar's late fees come under fire with consumer's lawsuit in Boston federal court|author= Chesto, Jon|publisher= Mass.

The suit cited several hidden charges, including a charge to talk to a customer service representative even when customers call to report a problem that cannot be handled through the website or automated phone system, additional fees on top of the cost of a parking ticket even if the ticket was overturned in court, late fees starting at $50, a fee to retrieve items left in cars, and an inactivity fee.<ref name=BostonLawsuit>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/business/articles/2009/10/13/suit_alleges_zipcar_pulled_fast_ones_with_excessive_fees/|title= Suit alleges Zipcar pulled fast ones with excessive fees |work=Boston Globe|date=2009-10-13|accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref>  According to the complaint, many customers may not even be aware of the charges because Zipcar does not send monthly statements.

Gorton found that every penalty except an inactive-user charge is legal.<ref name=BostonLawsuitDismissed>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/business/articles/2010/06/11/suit_vs_zipcar_over_fees_is_dismissed/|title= Suit vs. Zipcar over fees is dismissed|work=Boston Globe|date=2010-06-11|accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref>  In August 2016, Zipcar agreed to settle a case involving allegations of charging New York consumers illegal damage fees for rental vehicles. According to New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, New York State law mandates if rental car companies mean to pursue charges for damages to their vehicles, they must give consumers the opportunity to dispute the complaint. Schneiderman's office alleges Zipcar failed to follow this requirement. The company sometimes purportedly charged consumers damage fees before notifying them of the charges.  As a settlement, Zipcar will refund any damage charges assessed against consumers who disputed their responsibility for the damage. Additionally, the company will pay the Attorney General's Office $35,000 for fees and costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legalnewsline.com/stories/510974455-zipcar-to-settle-allegations-of-charging-consumers-illegal-damage-fees|title=Zipcar to settle allegations of charging consumers illegal damage fees|last=Iandolo|first=Mark|access-date=2016-08-17}}</ref> In addition, Zipcar is barred from charging customers for damage unless those customers agree they are liable or the company obtains a legal determination—for example, from a court—that the driver is responsible.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avoid-being-unfairly-charged-rental-175313147.html |title=Avoid Being Unfairly Charged for Rental Car Damage |website=Finance.yahoo.com |date=2016-08-26 |accessdate=2016-09-04}}</ref> As of September 25, 2018, the business is not accredited by the [[Better Business Bureau]] and averages a one-star review from the BBB from numerous complaints alleging deceptive business practices.<ref>https://www.bbb.org/us/ma/boston/profile/auto-renting-and-leasing/zipcar-inc-0021-90415</ref>

==University, organization and business partnerships==
Zipcar launched its Zipcar for Business program in early 2004 to provide companies with discounts on Monday-Friday driving. Since the launch of the program, Zipcar has signed 10,000 small, medium, and large sized businesses, as companies are increasingly adopting Zipcar's on demand car rental model as a cost-saving alternative for employee travel.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/business/23share.html | title=A Shift From Company Cars | work=The New York Times | author=Elizabeth Olson | date=2010-11-22}}</ref> Zipcar has partnered with over 600 colleges and universities across North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zipcar.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=289 |title=Zipcar Now Offers Campus Car Sharing With More Than 300 North American Colleges and Universities - Oct 9, 2012 |publisher=Zipcar.mediaroom.com |date=2012-10-09 |accessdate=2013-10-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520193501/http://zipcar.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43 |archive-date=May 20, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==Zipcar fleet==
[[File:20120922 Volt-Chicago.JPG|thumb|The [[Chevrolet Volt]] [[Plug-in hybrid]] is available to Zipcar members in [[Chicago]].]]
Zipcar offers more than 50 makes and models of vehicles. Each vehicle has a home location: a reserved parking space located on a street, driveway, or neighborhood parking lot in the member's area, to which it must be returned at the end of the reservation. The locations of all Zipcars and models available at those locations are available at the Zipcar website. Zipcar currently (2019) has a fleet of 12,000+ vehicles. The makes and models of Zipcar vehicles available vary by location (for example, on college campuses, most Zipcar vehicles are economy, [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]], and full-size cars), though members are able to choose the exact make and model of vehicle they wish from the list of available vehicles online or in the Zipcar [[smartphone]] application. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zipcar.com/press/overview|title=Zipcar Overview {{!}} Zipcar Press Center|website=www.zipcar.com|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref>

Most Zipcar vehicles will feature decals with the Zipcar logo. Each vehicle has a "name" that help the renter to identify their specific vehicle. Zipcar offers vehicles in different categories, such as economy cars, [[electric vehicles]] (EV's), [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] vehicles, full-size cars, luxury vehicles (such as those from [[Audi]], [[BMW]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], and other luxury manufacturers), [[SUV]]'s, [[pickup trucks]], and cargo [[vans]]. A Zipcar vehicle will not unlock for the renter until their exact reservation time. Renters unlock their vehicle (both at the beginning of the reservation and throughout the rental) by either holding their Zipcar membership Radio Frequency Identification [[RFID]] card or [[smartphone]] against the upper corner of the vehicle's windshield. The vehicle's keys are always tied to the steering column of the vehicle, and stay inside the vehicle at all times. A Zipcar "Copilot" guide is located in the driver's side sun visor, and includes a complimentary refueling card (gasoline card), insurance information, the vehicle registration card, and information about both the vehicle, as well as rental policies and procedures.

===Embedded technologies===
Zipcars have RFID readers located on the windshield that communicates with the card to lock and unlock the doors of the vehicle. Each vehicle records hours of usage and mileage, which is uploaded to a central computer via a wireless data link. The location of the vehicles is not tracked during a reservation for privacy reasons but is trackable, and all cars are equipped with a "kill" function that allows the company to prevent the car from starting in the event of theft.  Zipcar also offers the embedded [[Information Technology|Information Technologies]] it has installed in its fleet as a fleet optimization service through its [[FastFleet]] service.

During a rental, a Zipcar member can interface with their rented vehicle using the Zipcar [[smartphone]] app, which includes the ability to locate the vehicle in a parking lot (including [[GPS]] location and the ability to sound the vehicle's horn and flash the lights) and unlock or lock the vehicle.

===Clean fuel vehicles===
Among its fleet of fuel-efficient vehicles, and through an agreement between Honda and Zipcar, the program offers [[alternative fuel vehicle|clean fuel]] and [[low-emission vehicle]]s that include the [[Honda Insight|Insight]] [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]], [[Honda Civic Hybrid|Civic Hybrid]], and [[Honda Fit EV]] all-[[electric car]]. Vehicles such as the [[Chevrolet Volt]] and [[Toyota Prius]] are also available. <ref name=Members/>

===Zipcar Flex===
In the United Kingdom, some vehicles are branded "Zipcar Flex" which means that they can be left anywhere within a designated zone, rather than in a specific parking space. The remaining vehicles are branded "Zipcar Roundtrip".<ref>Fleet News https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/fleet-industry-news/2017/07/10/zipcar-flex-one-way-drive-and-drop-car-club-service-launched-in-london</ref>

==Insurance==
[[File:Zipcar DC 4997 03 2009.jpg|thumb|Zipcar drop off/pick up area in downtown [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
Zipcar provides liability coverage of $100,000 bodily injury per person, $300,000 bodily injury maximum, and $25,000 property damage per accident for members over 21 years of age who joined after March 1, 2015. Members at fault are responsible for the first $1,000 of costs related to the repair, recovery, and loss of use of any Zipcar vehicle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zipcar.com/how/faqs/faq-28 |title=What's the deal with insurance?}}</ref> However, members can purchase no-liability insurance for an additional $79 a year. Members involved in accidents where fault is not determined (such as in a hit and run) must pay the first $1000 of these costs. For members under 21, Zipcar provides insurance coverage at state-mandated levels.

Zipcar has received some scrutiny for their low coverage limits.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Before Driving a Zipcar, Consider Liability Insurance|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/your-money/23money.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2011-04-22|access-date = 2016-02-16|issn = 0362-4331|first = Ron|last = Lieber}}</ref>

Insurance coverage may vary depending on the region of use. For example, Canadian members in Toronto, Ontario, are provided with $1,000,000 in liability coverage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zipcar.com/toronto/apply/rules-of-vehicle-use |title=Zipcar: Toronto, ON Terms and Conditions |accessdate=2008-05-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519144252/http://www.zipcar.com/toronto/apply/rules-of-vehicle-use |archive-date=May 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Vancouver, BC members are provided with $2,000,000 in liability coverage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zipcar.com/vancouver/apply/rules-of-vehicle-use |title=Zipcar: Vancouver, BC Terms and Conditions |accessdate=2008-05-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609030250/http://www.zipcar.com/vancouver/apply/rules-of-vehicle-use |archive-date=June 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Both regions in Canada also include comprehensive and collision coverage in addition to liability insurance. Previously, Zipcars traveling into Canada from the U.S. required members to obtain a special insurance card from Zipcar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zipcar.com/how/faqs/faq?subject=drive_away_us |title=Zipcar FAQ: If I reserve a Zipcar in the US, can I drive out of state or in Canada? |accessdate=2008-05-18}}</ref> As of February 2018, however, it appears that this is no longer the policy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.zipcar.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004485367-Driving-Between-US-and-Canada |title=Driving Between US and Canada – Zipcar |accessdate=2018-07-02}}</ref> Canadian Zipcars traveling into the U.S. do not need the extra insurance card.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zipcar.com/how/faqs/faq?subject=drive_away_ca |title=Zipcar FAQ: If I reserve a Zipcar in Canada, can I drive in the US? |accessdate=2008-05-18}}</ref>

Similar to members of Zipcar U.S., members of Zipcar London, UK, require a special 'vehicle on-hire' certificate when traveling abroad, which can be obtained from Zipcar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zipcar.co.uk/how/faqs/faq?subject=drive_away_uk |title=Zipcar FAQ: If I reserve a Zipcar in the UK, can I drive it abroad? |accessdate=2012-07-18}}</ref>
