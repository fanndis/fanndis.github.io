The '''Clinton health care plan''' was a 1993 [[Health care reform in the United States|healthcare reform]] package proposed by the administration of President [[Bill Clinton]] and closely associated with the chair of the task force devising the plan, [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Clinton]].

President Clinton had [[Bill Clinton 1992 presidential campaign|campaigned]] heavily on health care in the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]]. The task force was created in January 1993, but its own processes were somewhat controversial and drew litigation. Its goal was to come up with a comprehensive plan to provide [[universal health care]] for all Americans, which was to be a cornerstone of the administration's first-term agenda. The president delivered a major health care speech to the [[US Congress]] in September 1993. During his speech he proposed an enforced mandate for employers to provide health insurance coverage to all of their employees.

Opposition to the plan was heavy from [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarians]], and the [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance]] industry. The industry produced a highly effective television ad, "[[Harry and Louise]]", in an effort to rally public support against the plan.

Instead of uniting behind the original proposal, many Democrats offered a number of competing plans of their own. Hillary Clinton was drafted by the Clinton Administration to head a new Task Force and sell the plan to the American people, which ultimately backfired amid the barrage from the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries and considerably diminished her own popularity. On September 26, 1994, the final compromise Democratic bill was declared dead by [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[George J. Mitchell]].<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/27/us/health-care-debate-overview-national-health-program-president-s-greatest-goal.html?pagewanted=all| title = National Health Program, President's Greatest Goal, Declared Dead In Congress| author = Clymer, Adam| date = September 27, 1994| accessdate = May 17, 2016| work = The New York Times| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160526072124/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/27/us/health-care-debate-overview-national-health-program-president-s-greatest-goal.html?pagewanted=all| archive-date = May 26, 2016| url-status = live}}</ref>

According to an address to Congress by then-President Bill Clinton on September 22, 1993, the proposed bill would provide a "health care security card" to every citizen that would irrevocably entitle him or her to medical treatment and preventative services, including for pre-existing conditions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bill|first1=Clinton|title=Address on Health Care Reform (September 22, 1993)|url=http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/speech-3926|website=Mill Center|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=15 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018221153/http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/speech-3926|archive-date=October 18, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

To achieve this, the Clinton health plan required each [[US citizen]] and permanent [[resident alien]] to become enrolled in a qualified health plan on his or her own or through programs mandated to be offered by businesses with more than 5,000 full-time employees. Subsidies were to be provided to those too poor to afford coverage, including complete subsidies for those below a set income level. Users would choose plans offered by regional health alliances to be established by each state. These alliances would purchase insurance coverage for the state's residents and could set fees for doctors who charge per procedure.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pear|first1=Robert|title=Clinton's Health Plan: What the States Must Do; States Are Wary Partners In President's Big Venture|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/23/us/clinton-s-health-plan-what-states-must-states-are-wary-partners-president-s-big.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=15 October 2016|work=The New York Times|date=23 September 1993|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019032025/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/23/us/clinton-s-health-plan-what-states-must-states-are-wary-partners-president-s-big.html?pagewanted=all|archive-date=October 19, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Pear|first1=Robert|title=Clinton's Health Plan: The Overview; Congress is given the Clinton plan for health care|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/28/us/clinton-s-health-plan-overview-congress-given-clinton-proposal-for-health-care.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|accessdate=15 October 2016|date=23 October 1993|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019041152/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/28/us/clinton-s-health-plan-overview-congress-given-clinton-proposal-for-health-care.html?pagewanted=all|archive-date=October 19, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The act provided funding to be sent to the states for the administration of the plan, beginning at $14&nbsp;billion in 1993 and reaching $38&nbsp;billion by 2003.

{{quote|Millions of Americans are just a pink slip away from losing their health insurance, and one serious illness away from losing all their savings. Millions more are locked into the jobs they have now just because they or someone in their family has once been sick and they have what is called the [[preexisting condition]]. And on any given day, over 37 million Americans—most of them working people and their little children—have no health insurance at all. And in spite of all this, our medical bills are growing at over twice the rate of inflation, and the United States spends over a third more of its income on health care than any other nation on Earth.}}

[[Conservatism in the United States|Conservatives]], [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarians]], and the [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance]] industry proceeded to campaign against the plan, criticizing it as being overly bureaucratic and restrictive of patient choice.

==Litigation==
The First Lady's role in the secret proceedings of the Health Care Task Force also sparked litigation in the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]] in relation to the [[Federal Advisory Committee Act]] (FACA), which requires openness in government. The Clinton White House argued that the [[s:Constitution of the United States of America#Section 3 2|Recommendation Clause]] in Article II of the US Constitution would make it unconstitutional to apply the procedural requirements of FACA to her participation in the meetings of the Task Force. Some constitutional experts argued to the court that such a legal theory was not supported by the text, the history, or the structure of the Constitution.<ref name="amicus brief">{{cite journal |ssrn=971067 |title=Amicus Brief of J.

A few weeks later, Mitchell announced that his compromise plan was dead and that health care reform would have to wait at least until the next Congress.

In 1997, the Clinton administration supported an experimental program in New York that paid medical schools to train fewer doctors to reduce a "glut of physicians".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9708/24/doctor.glut/ |title=Report: U.S. to pay hospitals not to train doctors - August 24, 1997 |publisher=CNN |date=1997-08-24 |accessdate=2016-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013100147/http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9708/24/doctor.glut/ |archive-date=October 13, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2004, as a US senator from New York, Hillary Clinton argued in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the current health care system is unsustainable, and she offered several solutions.<ref>[[Hillary Clinton|Clinton, Hillary Rodham]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/magazine/now-can-we-talk-about-health-care-181056.html?sec=health&pagewanted=all "Now Can We Talk About Health Care?"] ''The New York Times'', April 18, 2004.

In 2005, referring to her previous efforts at health care reform, she said, "I learned some valuable lessons about the legislative process, the importance of bipartisan cooperation and the wisdom of taking small steps to get a big job done."<ref name="NYT_Evolution"/> Again in 2007, she reflected on her role in 1993–1994: "I think that both the process and the plan were flawed. We were trying to do something that was very hard to do, and we made a lot of mistakes."<ref>Toner, Robin and [[Anne Kornblut|Kornblut, Anne]].

She received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from doctors, hospitals, drug companies, and insurance companies for her 2006 re-election in the Senate, including several insurance companies that were members of the Health Insurance Association of America that helped defeat the Clinton Health Plan in 1994.<ref name="Hernandez_NYT_1995"/> [[Charles N. Kahn III]], a Republican who was executive vice president of the Health Insurance Association in 1993 and 1994, refers to his previous battles with Clinton as "ancient history", and says "she is extremely knowledgeable about health care and has become a Congressional leader on the issue."<ref name="Hernandez_NYT_1995"/>

Until the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act|Affordable Healthcare for America Act]], a combination of factors kept health care off the top of the agenda. For example, politicians were not eager to confront the forces that successfully frustrated the Clinton effort, [[health maintenance organization]]s were able to limit cost increases to some extent, and a conservative Republican majority in Congress or a conservative Republican president was in power or in office.<ref name="Krugman">Krugman, Paul, and Wells, Robin.

The Clinton health care plan remains the most prominent national proposal associated with Hillary Clinton and may have influenced her prospects in the 2008 presidential election. There are some similarities between Clinton's plan and Republican [[Mitt Romney]]'s health care plan, which has been implemented in Massachusetts,<ref name="Cohn_TNR"/><ref>Cannon, Michael.
