The first issue of ''Svenska Dagbladet'' appeared on 18 December 1884. Ivar Anderson is among its former [[editors-in-chief]] who assumed the post in 1940.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Karl Erik Gustafsson|author2=Per Rydén|title=A History of the Press in Sweden|date=2010|publisher=Nordicom|location=Gothenburg|isbn=978-91-86523-08-4|url=http://presshistoria.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/A-history-of-the-Press-in-Sweden.pdf|access-date=2 March 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213232250/http://presshistoria.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/A-history-of-the-Press-in-Sweden.pdf|archive-date=13 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The paper is published in [[Stockholm]] and provides coverage of national and international news as well as local coverage of the [[Greater Stockholm]] region. Its [[Subscription business model|subscriber]]s are concentrated in the capital, but it is distributed in most of Sweden. During the beginning of the 1900s the paper was one of the [[right-wing]] publications in Stockholm.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Leif Yttergren|author2=Hans Bolling|title=The 1912 Stockholm Olympics: Essays on the Competitions, the People, the City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EpsGxfMMpUgC&pg=PA203|accessdate=20 December 2014|date=5 November 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-0066-6|page=203}}</ref>

''Svenska Dagbladet'' is owned by [[Schibsted]]<ref name=swi/> which purchased it in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eva Harrie|title=The Nordic Media Market|url=http://www.nordicom.gu.se/sites/default/files/publikationer-hela-pdf/nmt09_001-194.pdf|publisher=Nordicom, University of Gothenburg|accessdate=10 December 2014|location=Göteborg|date=2009}}</ref> The stated position of the editorial page is "independently moderate" (''oberoende moderat''), which means it is independent but adheres to the [[liberal conservatism]] of the [[Moderate Party]]. Despite this position, the paper is also regarded as [[conservative]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Sigurd Allern|author2=Mark Blach-Ørsten|title=The News Media as a Political Institution|journal=Journalism Studies|date=2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=92–105|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2010.511958|s2cid=143196672}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Jonas Ohlsson|title=The Practice of Newspaper Ownership|date=2012|publisher=University of Gothenburg|location=Bohus|isbn=978-91-88212-98-6|url=http://www.som.gu.se/digitalAssets/1503/1503041_the-practice-of-newspaper-ownership---jonas-ohlsson.pdf|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>

In November 2000 ''Svenska Dagbladet'' changed its format from [[Broadsheet (newspaper)|broadsheet]] to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A Small World – Role Models In Scandinavia|url=http://www.jmg.gu.se/digitalAssets/1294/1294092_englishpaper--tabloidization-js2.pdf|publisher=Göteborgs University|accessdate=6 February 2015|date=2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Ulrika Andersson|title=From Broadsheet to Tabloid: Content changes in Swedish newspapers in the light of a shrunken size|journal=Observatorio (OBS*) Journal|date=2013|volume=7|issue=4|url=http://obs.obercom.pt/index.php/obs/article/download/708/626|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref> In 2005 the paper started  a Web portal for business news as a joint venture with ''[[Aftonbladet]]''.<ref name=mgraf>{{cite web|author=Maria Grafström|title=The Development of Swedish Business Journalism|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:645930/FULLTEXT01.pdf|publisher=Uppsala University|accessdate=29 November 2014|format=PhD Thesis|date=2006}}</ref>

Since 1925 ''Svenska Dagbladet'' has awarded an individual sportsperson or a team the [[Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal]] at the end of each year.

As the only other Swedish morning newspaper to aspire to full national and international coverage, Svenska Dagbladet is the chief rival of Dagens Nyheter.

Anna Careborg was appointed acting CEO and Editor-in-chief in January 2019, taking over from Fredric Karén, who is now working with Torstar Group, owners of the Toronto Star, in Canada. 

Careborg took over fully as new CEO and Editor-in-chief of Svenska Dagbladet in October 2019.
