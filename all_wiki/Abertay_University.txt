'''Abertay University''', formerly the University of Abertay Dundee, is one of two [[Public university|public universities]] in the city of [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]]. In 1872, [[Sir David Baxter, 1st Baronet]] of Kilmaron, left a bequest for the establishment of a mechanics' institute in Dundee and the '''Dundee Institute of Technology''' was formed in 1888. As early as 1902 it was recognised by the [[Scottish Education Department]] as an educational hub, and was one of the first to be designated a [[central institution]], akin to an 'industrial university'. Abertay gained University status in 1994.

Abertay launched the world's first computer games degree in 1997 and in 2017 held a programme of events celebrating 20 Years of Games. Abertay was also the first to offer a degree in Ethical Hacking, starting in 2006.

==History==

The following history to 1988 provides a summary account that relies primarily on the book published by Dundee Institute of Technology in 1989, 'The First Hundred Years: 1888-1988'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dundee Institute of Technology |date=1989 |title=The First Hundred Years: 1888-1988}}</ref> Where additional sources have been used, post 1988, these have been cited accordingly.

===The Baxter bequest (1872)===

In 1872 Sir David Baxter, 1st Baronet of Kilmaron, died and bequeathed £20,000 (£1,581,200 adjusting for inflation) for the establishment of a mechanics' institute in Dundee. The Baxter bequest was intended to create an educational establishment permitting young (male) working mechanics and other craftsmen to better themselves.  After some years of delay the trustees finalised a scheme and met the conditions of the bequest and the Dundee Technical Institute opened on 15 October 1888 in grounds, purchased from [[University College, Dundee]], adjacent to Small's Wynd, Dundee.  Initially 238 students enrolled and classes were conducted based on the syllabus of the Government Science and Art Department of South Kensington and the City & Guilds of London Institute.  Subjects were primarily scientific and technical although applied art was also taught, and jute spinning and textile design were soon added to the portfolio.

In 1901 the Dundee Technical Institute enrolled 723 part-time students and was one of the first education hubs to be recognised as a 'central institution' by the Scotch Education Department.  In 1906 a new site in Bell Street, Dundee was purchased to build a larger complex to accommodate a growing student population.  In 1911 the completed complex was formally opened as the Dundee Technical College & School of Art.  The portfolio had by now expanded again to include marine engineering and navigation.

The First World War retarded enrolments and growth but the vocational nature of the institute meant that its classes were highly relevant to the war effort. Records show that the first women students enrolled in 1914. After the war, the institute continued to expand adding a new school of pharmacy, and more specialist classes in engineering and building.  Commercial classes in finance, economics and accounting were added to support trade at home and abroad.

===The Duncan of Jordanstone bequest (1909)===

In 1909 James Duncan of Jordanstone left £60,000 (£4,993,263 adjusting for inflation) to establish an art college in Dundee.  It was only after a lengthy legal battle surrounding this bequest and the right of the existing college to spend the money, that a new scheme was entered into in 1933 permitting the establishment of the Dundee Institute of Art and Technology.  The scheme allowed for separate technical and art colleges under a single governance framework.  Plans for a new art college were drawn up in 1937. However, owing to the outbreak of the Second World War, plans were delayed and construction did not begin until 1953.  The college of art became a formally separate institution, known as the [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design]], in 1975, remaining independent until 1994 when it became part of the University of Dundee.

===First degrees (1951)===

After the Second World War enrolments and the scope of delivery continued to expand, as did the reputation of the institute. By 1951 the institute was teaching courses that led to examinations for the external degrees of the University of London in pharmacy, mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering.  In 1955 the National Council for Technological Awards was established and validated diplomas in technology which were equivalent in standard if not in name to honours degrees. In 1963 the Robbins Committee on Higher Education set out the principle that higher education should be available to all who wanted it and were suitably well qualified.  The Committee recommended that the government should expand higher education in the UK, particularly in science and technology.

===University status (1994)===

Abertay University was created in 1994, under government legislation granting the title "University of Abertay Dundee" to the Dundee Institute of Technology.  Since 2014 the University has promoted itself as Abertay University.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/comment/the-poppletonian/you-make-me-feel-brand-new/2011864.article | title = You make me feel brand new | accessdate = 13 December 2014 | author =  Laurie Taylor | work=Times Higher Education | date=3 June 2014}}</ref> The university's name was formally changed to Abertay University by an [[Order of Council]] on 1 September 2019.<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2019/163/contents/made|The Abertay University (Scotland) Order of Council 2019]</ref>

==Campus==
[[Image:Abertay Kidd building.jpg|thumb|Kydd Building]]
[[Image:abertaylib.jpg|thumb|The Bernard King library]]

Abertay University is situated in the centre of Dundee.  The campus buildings include the historic Old College buildings of Dundee Business School, the Bernard King Library, scenes of crime teaching facilities, specialist Ethical Hacking labs designed for research into computer hacking and misuse, and modern computer games labs in the UK Centre for Excellence in Computer Games Education.

The Bernard King Library in Bell Street opened to learners in February 1998 and was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 30 June 1998. The library was voted best new building in Scotland in the 1998 Scottish Design Awards competition.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue18/down-your-way|title= Down your way: University of Abertay Dundee library |last=Hunter |first=Philip |work=ARIADNE magazine |date=19 December 1998 |accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref> The building has a stone rectangular 'spine' and a curved glass front mimicking an open book. The Library houses an English Language learning centre, a specialist Law library, and an EU funded IT suite.  The library was designed with the digital age very much in mind, and although the traditional books still feature, the emphasis was and is very much on providing access to digital information through online subscriptions.

The Student Centre building in Bell Street opened in 2005 providing a home to the Students' Association as well as a trading centre with an art gallery (Hannah Maclure Centre), cinema, student bars, food, and retail trading outlets.

Abertay is a small university that receives the majority of its funding for teaching rather than research. Nevertheless, according to the results of the [[Research Excellence Framework]] 2014 (REF2014) published on 18 December 2014,<ref name="ref2014results">{{cite web | title=Results & submissions : REF 2014 | url=http://results.ref.ac.uk/ | accessdate=22 December 2014 }}</ref> Abertay was the highest ranked modern university in Scotland for 'research intensity'.<ref name="Paul Jump">{{cite news | url =http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/ref-2014-rerun-who-are-the-game-players/2017670.article | title = REF 2014 rerun: who are the 'game players'? | accessdate = 14 February 2015 | first =  Paul |last=Jump | work=Times Higher Education | date=1 January 2015}}</ref> The University submitted an increased proportion of staff in REF2014 compared to RAE2008 and achieved an average score of 2.15 - which in REF terms means 'quality that is recognised internationally in terms of originality, significance, and rigour'. This was an improvement from the average score of 1.83, 'national recognition', achieved in RAE2008.

Submissions were made in:

*Unit 4 Psychology, Psychiatry and Neurosciences
*Unit 5 Biological Sciences
*Unit 7 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences
*Unit 15 General Engineering
*Unit 20 Law
*Unit 23 Sociology
*Unit 26 Sport and Exercise Sciences, Leisure and Tourism

Abertay submitted 30% more staff in REF 2014 than in RAE 2008, in seven Units of Assessment (UoAs) compared to six in 2008. Abertay submitted to three Units of Assessment for the first time: Sports Science, Sociology, and Biological Sciences. Abertay scored a proportion of research as 4* in six of the seven UoAs in 2014, compared to only two out of the six units submitted in 2008.  Abertay submitted 36% of its academic staff to the REF.

===Electives for the 21st century===
An electives scheme provides opportunities, from 2015/16, for all early years students to broaden their intellectual horizon beyond the standard single or joint Honours degree combinations on offer.

==Symbols==

===Coat of arms===
Prior to 1953 no coat of arms was registered in the name of the college. The original Ensigns Armorial were recorded in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland on 25 July 1953, in the name of Dundee Technical College. They were subsequently transferred to Dundee College of Technology in 1977, then to Dundee Institute of Technology in 1988 and, finally, to the University of Abertay Dundee on 25 April 1994.

The arms are described as:
"Party per fess, in chief tierced in pale: 1st, Ermine, a chevron engrailed between three mullets Gules; 2nd, Azure, three chevronels Or; 3rd, Argent, a spray of oak Proper fructed Or between three pheons Azure; in base Azure, a pot of three flowering lilies Argent between two flanches Or each charged with a book Gules."

The top left sector is taken from the arms of Sir David Baxter of Kilmaron, who bequeathed a significant sum of money in order to establish the original Dundee Technical Institute in 1888. The top right sector is taken from the arms of Sir William Dalgleish, who was the senior trustee of what by then was known as Dundee Technical College and School of Art, and who opened the first building – Old College – on Abertay's present campus on Bell Street in 1911. The top middle sector of three chevrons is the heraldic symbol for "technical".{{verification needed|date=October 2019}} The pot of lilies in base is taken from the arms of the City of Dundee, with the books on either side representing education.

===Motto===
''Beatus homo qui invenit sapientiam'' (Blessed is the one who finds wisdom).

===Tartan===

Aaron McCauley, a graduate of Abertay, designed and registered the Abertay tartan in 2003. The tartan is based on Abertay's promotional colours of dark blue, red, gold and green from its coat of arms.<ref>
