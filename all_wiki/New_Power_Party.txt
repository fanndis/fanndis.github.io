The '''New Power Party''' ('''NPP''') is a political party in [[Taiwan]] formed in early 2015. The party emerged from the [[Sunflower Student Movement]] in 2014, and [[advocates]] for [[universal human rights]], [[civil liberties|civil]] and [[political freedom|political]] liberties, as well as [[Taiwan independence]]/[[Taiwanese nationalism|nationalism]].<ref name="nationalism">[http://www.newpowerparty.tw/policy New Power Party Platform](Chinese)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/09/14/2003627680|title=New Power Party announces leadership structure - Taipei Times|website=www.taipeitimes.com|access-date=2016-04-06}}</ref><ref>[https://qz.com/596669/taiwans-newest-politicians-include-a-rock-star-and-an-aboriginal-activist/ Taiwan's newest politicians include a rock star and an aboriginal activist]</ref>  The party is a part of the political phenomenon known as the "Third Force" ({{lang|zh-hant|第三勢力}}), in which new political parties, unaligned with traditional [[Pan-Green Coalition|Pan-Green]] or [[Pan-Blue Coalition]]s, sought to provide an alternative in Taiwanese politics.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Civic groups voice support for 'third force' - Taipei Times|url = http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2016/01/08/2003636709|website = www.taipeitimes.com|access-date = 2016-01-09}}</ref> Nevertheless, the NPP's policies are very much aligned and closely matches the Pan-Green camp; thus the NPP cooperated with the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) against the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) in the 2016 elections, going as far as not to run in traditional KMT strongholds to avoid competition with the DPP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newbloommag.net/2016/01/17/winners-losers-legislature-2016/%20=%202016-01-17 |script-title=zh:沒有符合條件的頁面|access-date=2016-04-06}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The party works in tandem with a perceived generational shift towards Taiwan-centrism as the new socio-cultural norm.<ref>{{cite book |last=Read |first=Graeme  |title=The China Story Yearbook: Power |publisher=[[ANU Press]] |date=April 11, 2019 |pages=179–182 |chapter=Sharp Power, Youth Power, and the New Politics in Taiwan |doi=10.22459/CSY.2019|isbn=978-1-760-46280-2}}</ref>

The party was started by [[Freddy Lim]], lead vocalist of Taiwanese heavy metal band [[Chthonic (band)|Chthonic]],<ref name=":0" /> veteran activist Michael Lin,  human rights lawyers {{ill|Lin Feng-cheng|zh|林峯正}}, [[Chiu Hsien-chih]], and other prominent figures of the [[Sunflower Student Movement]]. Lim headed the party-building process, which saw the inclusion of [[Hung Tzu-yung]], sister of the late [[Death of Hung Chung-chiu|Hung Chung-chiu]], environmental lawyer {{ill|Ko Shao-chen|zh|柯劭臻}}, and author-activist [[Neil Peng]] into the party. On 12 September 2015, the NPP was officially formed with the election of [[Huang Kuo-chang]] as executive leader, heading a leadership team of six deputy leaders.

The NPP won five legislative seats in the [[2016 Taiwanese legislative election]], three from constituency and two from party-list votes, beating out long-time third party [[People First Party (Taiwan)|People First Party]]. However, two of its legislators left the party in 2019. In the [[2020 Taiwanese legislative election]], NPP won three party-list seats.

==Platform==
The NPP aims to rewrite the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]]. The constitution operates under the assumption that the Republic governs all of China (including [[mainland China]], which the ROC has not governed since 1949), to just refer to [[Taiwan]].<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/19/taiwan-politics-china-new-power-party-beijing-ma-xi-kmt-dpp/|title=Taiwan's Newest Political Party Was Co-Founded by a Tattooed Rockstar|first=Lorand|last=Laskai|publisher=Foreign Policy|date=2015-11-19|access-date=2016-01-06}}</ref>

The NPP supports the legalization of [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|same-sex marriage]] and is generally in favor of abolition of [[Capital punishment in Taiwan|capital punishment]]. {{Citation needed|reason=General political platform is unsourced! |date=November 2019}} The NPP also takes a more leftist stance than the [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] in labor and welfare issues.<ref name="Progressivism" />

==History==
