===Prehistoric and ancient literacy===

====Origins of literacy====
Literacy emerged with the development of [[numeracy]] and computational devices as early as 8000 BCE. Script developed independently at least five times in human history [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], the [[Indus civilization]], lowland [[Mesoamerica]], and [[China]].<ref name=camb>Chrisomalis, Stephen (2009), "The Origins and Coevolution of Literacy and Numeracy", in Olsen, D. & Torrance, N. (Eds.), ''The Cambridge Handbook of Literacy'' (pp. 59-74). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Writing Systems |url=http://hkotek.com/teaching/intro2015/week5-writing-systems.pdf |accessdate=5 August 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Bill of sale Louvre AO3765.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Bill of sale of a male slave and a building in [[Shuruppak]], [[Sumer]]ian tablet, circa 2600 BC]]
The earliest forms of [[written communication]] originated in [[Sumer]], located in southern Mesopotamia about 3500-3000 BCE. During this era, literacy was "a largely functional matter, propelled by the need to manage the new quantities of information and the new type of governance created by trade and large scale production".<ref>Easton, P. (in press). "History and spread of literacy", Excerpted from ''Sustaining Literacy in Africa: Developing a Literate Environment'', Paris: UNESCO Press pp. 46-56.</ref> Writing systems in Mesopotamia first emerged from a recording system in which people used impressed token markings to manage trade and agricultural production.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schmandt-Besserat | first1 = D | year = 1978 | title = The earliest precursor of writing | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume = 238 | issue = 6| pages = 38–47 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0678-50 | bibcode = 1978SciAm.238f..50S }}</ref> The token system served as a precursor to early [[cuneiform]] writing once people began recording information on clay tablets. [[Proto-cuneiform]] texts exhibit not only numerical signs, but also [[ideograms]] depicting objects being counted.<ref name=camb/>

[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] emerged from 3300-3100 BCE and depicted royal iconography that emphasized power amongst other elites. The Egyptian hieroglyphic writing system was the first notation system to have [[phonetic]] values.

Writing in lowland Mesoamerica was first put into practice by the [[Olmec]] and [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] civilizations in 900-400 BCE. These civilizations used [[glyph]]ic writing and bar-and-dot numerical notation systems for purposes related to royal iconography and calendar systems.

The earliest written notations in China date back to the [[Shang Dynasty]] in 1200 BCE. These systematic notations were found inscribed on bones and recorded sacrifices made, tributes received, and animals hunted, which were activities of the elite. These oracle-bone inscriptions were the early ancestors of modern Chinese script and contained [[logosyllabic]] script and numerals.

[[Indus script]] is largely pictorial and has not been deciphered yet. It may or may not include abstract signs. It is thought that they wrote from right to left and that the script is thought to be [[logographic]]. Because it has not been deciphered, linguists disagree on whether it is a complete and independent writing system; however, it is genuinely thought to be an independent writing system that emerged in the [[Harappa]] culture.

These examples indicate that early acts of literacy were closely tied to power and chiefly used for management practices, and probably less than 1% of the population was literate, as it was confined to a very small ruling elite.

====Origins of the alphabet====
According to [[social anthropologist]] [[Jack Goody]], there are two interpretations that regard the origin of the alphabet. Many classical scholars, such as historian [[Ignace Gelb]], credit the Ancient Greeks for creating the first alphabetic system (c. 750 BCE) that used distinctive signs for consonants and vowels. But Goody contests, "The importance of Greek culture of the subsequent history of Western Europe has led to an over-emphasis, by [[Classics|classicists]] and others, on the addition of specific [[vowel]] signs to the set of [[consonant]]al ones that had been developed earlier in Western Asia".<ref>Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 40-41. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}.</ref>

Thus, many scholars argue that the [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] of northern [[Canaan]] (modern-day [[Syria]]) invented the [[Abjad|consonantal alphabet]] as early as 1500 BCE. Much of this theory's development is credited to English archeologist [[Flinders Petrie]], who, in 1905, came across a series of Canaanite inscriptions located in the turquoise mines of [[Serabit el-Khadem]]. Ten years later, English Egyptologist [[Alan Gardiner]] reasoned that these letters contain an alphabet, as well as references to the Canaanite goddess [[Asherah]]. In 1948, [[William F. Albright]] deciphered the text using additional evidence that had been discovered subsequent to Goody's findings. This included a series of inscriptions from [[Ugarit]], discovered in 1929 by French archaeologist [[Claude F. A. Schaeffer]]. Some of these inscriptions were mythological texts (written in an early Canaanite dialect) that consisted of a 32-letter [[cuneiform]] consonantal alphabet.

Another significant discovery was made in 1953 when three arrowheads were uncovered, each containing identical Canaanite inscriptions from twelfth century BCE. According to [[Frank Moore Cross]], these inscriptions consisted of alphabetic signs that originated during the transitional development from pictographic script to a linear alphabet. Moreover, he asserts, "These inscriptions also provided clues to extend the decipherment of earlier and later alphabetic texts".<ref name="Cross, Frank Moore 1980 p. 1-20">Cross, Frank Moore, "Newly Found Inscriptions in Old Canaanite and Early Phoenician Scripts", ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'', No. 238 (Spring, 1980) p. 1-20.</ref>

The consonantal system of the Canaanite script inspired alphabetical developments in subsequent systems. During the Late [[Bronze Age]], successor alphabets appeared throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] region and were employed for [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]].

According to Goody, these cuneiform scripts may have influenced the development of the Greek alphabet several centuries later. Historically, the Greeks contended that their writing system was modeled after the Phoenicians. However, many Semitic scholars now believe that [[Ancient Greek]] is more consistent with an early form Canaanite that was used c. 1100 BCE. While the earliest Greek inscriptions are dated c. eighth century BCE, [[Epigraphy|epigraphical]] comparisons to [[Proto-Canaanite]] suggest that the Greeks may have adopted the consonantal alphabet as early as 1100 BCE, and later "added in five characters to represent vowels".<ref name="Goody, Jack 1987 p. 40-49">Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 40-49. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}</ref>

Phoenician, which is considered to contain the first [[list of writing systems|"linear alphabet"]], rapidly spread to the Mediterranean port cities in northern [[Canaan]].<ref name="Cross, Frank Moore 1980 p. 1-20"/> Some archeologists believe that Phoenician scripture had some influence on the developments of the Hebrew and Aramaic alphabets based on the fact that these languages evolved during the same time period, share similar features, and are commonly categorized into the same language group.<ref>McCarter, P. Kyle. "The Early Diffusion of the Alphabet", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' 37, No. 3 (Sep. 1974): 59-61.</ref>

When the Israelites migrated to Canaan between 1200 and 1001 BCE, they also adopted a variation of the Canaanite alphabet. [[Baruch ben Neriah]], Jeremiah's scribe, used this alphabet to create the later scripts of the [[Old Testament]]. The early Hebrew alphabet was prominent in the Mediterranean region until [[Neo-Babylonian|Chaldean Babylonian]] rulers exiled the Jews to [[Babylon]] in the sixth century BCE. It was then that the new script ("Square Hebrew") emerged and the older one rapidly died out.<ref name="Goody, Jack 1987 p. 40-49"/>

The [[Aramaic alphabet]] also emerged sometime between 1200 and 1000 BCE. As the [[Bronze Age collapse]]d, the [[Aramaeans]] moved into Canaan and Phoenician territories and adopted their scripts. Although early evidence of this writing is scarce, archeologists have uncovered a wide range of later Aramaic texts, written as early as the seventh century BCE. Due to its longevity and prevalence in the region, Achaemenid rulers would come to adopt it as a "diplomatic language".<ref>Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 50. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}</ref> The modern Aramaic alphabet rapidly spread east to the Kingdom of Nabataea, then to [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], eventually making its way to [[Africa]]. Aramaean merchants carried older variations of Aramaic as far as [[India]], where it later influenced the development of the [[Brahmi script]]. It also led to the developments of [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] (an Iranian adaptation), "as well as for a range of alphabets used by early [[Turkish peoples|Turkish]] and [[Mongol]] tribes in [[Siberia]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Turkestan]]".<ref>Goody, Jack (1987). ''The Interface Between The Written and the Oral''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p. 49-51. {{ISBN|0-521-33268-0}}</ref> Literacy at this period spread with the merchant classes and may have grown to number 15-20% of the total population.

The Aramaic language declined with the spread of [[Islam]], which was accompanied by the spread of [[Arabic]].

===Classical and post-classical literacy===
{{Further|Latin alphabet}}
Until recently it was thought that the majority of people were illiterate in ancient times.<ref>See for example: {{Cite book |title=Ancient literacy |last=Harris |first=William V. |date=1991 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674033818 |edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk. |location=Cambridge, MA |oclc=436359723}}</ref>  However, recent work challenges this perception.<ref>{{cite journal|first =Brian J. |last=Wright|title = Ancient Literacy in New Testament Research: Incorporating a Few More Lines of Enquiry|journal = Trinity Journal|volume = 36|date=2015|pages = 161–189|url= https://www.academia.edu/13211795}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Literacy in Ancient Everyday Life|last=Kolb (ed.)|first=Anne|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2018|isbn=9783110591880|location=Boston}}</ref> Anthony DiRenzo asserts that [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman society]] was "a civilization based on the book and the register", and "no one, either free or slave, could afford to be illiterate".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Di Renzo | first1 = Anthony | year = 2000 | title = His master's voice: Tiro and the rise of the roman secretarial class | url = http://faculty.ithaca.edu/direnzo/docs/scholarship/mastersvoice.pdf | journal = Journal of Technical Writing and Communication | volume = 30 | issue = 2| pages = 155–168 | doi=10.2190/b4yd-5fp7-1w8d-v3uc| s2cid = 153369618 }}</ref> Similarly Dupont points out, "The written word was all around them, in both public and private life: laws, calendars, regulations at shrines, and funeral epitaphs were engraved in stone or bronze. The Republic amassed huge archives of reports on every aspect of public life".<ref>Dupont, aFlorence. (1989) ''Daily Life in Ancient Rome'' Tr. Christopher Woodall. Oxford: Blackwell; p. 223</ref> The imperial civilian administration produced masses of documentation used in judicial, fiscal and administrative matters as did the municipalities. The army kept extensive records relating to supply and duty rosters and submitted reports. Merchants, shippers, and landowners (and their personal staffs) especially of the larger enterprises must have been literate.

In the late fourth century the [[Desert Father]] [[Pachomius]] would expect literacy of a candidate for admission to his monasteries:
<blockquote>they shall give him twenty Psalms or two of the Apostles' epistles or some other part of Scripture. And if he is illiterate he shall go at the first, third and sixth hours to someone who can teach and has been appointed for him. He shall stand before him and learn very studiously and with all gratitude. The fundamentals of a syllable, the verbs and nouns shall all be written for him and even if he does not want to he shall be compelled to read.<ref>[[Pachomius]], Rule 139.</ref></blockquote>

In the course of the 4th and 5th century the Churches made efforts to ensure a better clergy in particular among the bishops who were expected to have a classical education, which was the hallmark of a socially acceptable person in higher society (and possession of which allayed the fears of the pagan elite that their cultural inheritance would be destroyed).{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} Even after the remnants of the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell in the 470s, literacy continued to be a distinguishing mark of the elite as communications skills were still important in political and Church life (bishops were largely drawn from the senatorial class) in a new cultural synthesis that made "Christianity the Roman religion".<ref>Jas Elsner, Imperial Rome and Christian Triumph, 1998, p. 141, {{ISBN|0-19-284201-3}}</ref> However, these skills were less needed than previously in the absence of the large imperial administrative apparatus whose middle and top echelons the elite had dominated as if by right. Even so, in pre-modern times it is unlikely that literacy was found in more than about 30-40% of the population.<ref>This connection is pursued in [[Alan K. Bowman]] and [[Greg Woolf]], eds., ''Literacy and Power in the Ancient World'', (Cambridge) 1994.</ref> The highest percentage of literacy during the Dark Ages was among the clergy and monks who supplied much of the staff needed to administer the states of western Europe.

Post-Antiquity illiteracy was made much worse by the lack of a suitable writing medium. When the Western Roman Empire collapsed, the import of [[papyrus]] to Europe ceased. Since papyrus perishes easily and does not last well in the wetter European climate, [[parchment]] was used, which was expensive and accessible only by the Church and the wealthy. [[Paper]] was introduced into Europe in Spain in the 11th century. Its use spread north slowly over the next four centuries. Literacy saw a resurgence as a result, and by the 15th century paper had largely replaced parchment except for luxury manuscripts.

The [[Reformation]] stressed the importance of literacy and being able to read the Bible. The Protestant countries were the first to attain full literacy;<ref>{{cite web |title=How religion may affect educational attainment: scholarly theories and historical background |url=https://www.pewforum.org/2016/12/13/how-religion-may-affect-educational-attainment-scholarly-theories-and-historical-background/ |website=Pew Research Centre |publisher=Pew Research Centre |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref> [[Scandinavia]]n countries were fully literate in the early 17th century. The Church{{which|date=October 2018}} demanded literacy as the pre-requisite for [[marriage]] in [[Sweden]]{{when|date=October 2018}}, further propagating full literacy.
===Literacy and industrialization===
{{Further|Industrial Revolution}}
Modern industrialization began in England and Scotland in the 18th century, where there were relatively high levels of literacy among farmers, especially in Scotland. This  permitted the recruitment of literate craftsman, skilled workers, foremen and managers who supervised the emerging  textile factories and coal mines.  Much of a labor was unskilled, and especially in textile mills children as young as eight proved useful in handling chores and adding to the family income. Indeed, children were taken out of school to work alongside their parents in the factories. However by the mid-nineteenth century, unskilled labor forces were common in Western Europe, and British industry moved upscale, needing many more engineers and skilled workers who could handle technical instructions and handle complex situations. Literacy was essential  to be hired.<ref>Theodore S. Hamerow, ''The birth of a new Europe: State and society in the nineteenth century'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1989) pp 148–174.</ref> A senior government official told Parliament in 1870:
:Upon the speedy provision of elementary education depends are industrial prosperity. It is of no use trying to give technical teaching to our citizens without elementary education; uneducated labourers—and many of our labourers are utterly uneducated—are, for the most part, unskilled labourers, and if we leave our work–folk any longer unskilled, notwithstanding their strong sinews and determined energy, they will become overmatched in the competition of the world.<ref>Hamerow, p 159.</ref>

==Modern literacy==

=== Spread of literacy since the mid-twentieth century ===
[[File:Figure 1 Adult literacy rates have increased Reading the past writing the futureUPDATED.svg|thumb|Adult literacy rates have increased at a constant pace since 1950.]]
Literacy data published by [[UNESCO]] displays that since 1950, the adult literacy rate at the world level has increased by 5 percentage points every decade on average, from 55.7 per cent in 1950 to 86.2 per cent in 2015. However, for four decades, the population growth was so rapid that the number of illiterate adults kept increasing, rising from 700 million in 1950 to 878 million in 1990. Since then, the number has fallen markedly to 745 million in 2015, although it remains higher than in 1950 despite decades of universal education policies, literacy interventions and the spread of print material and information and communications technology (ICT). However, these trends have been far from uniform across regions.<ref name=":4" />

=== Regional disparities ===
Available global data indicates significant variations in literacy rates between world regions. [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[West Asia]], and [[Central Asia]] have achieved almost full adult literacy (individuals at or over the age of 15) for both men and women. Most countries in [[East Asia and the Pacific]], as well as [[Latin America and the Caribbean]], are above a 90% literacy rate for adults.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|date=September 2015|title=Adult and Youth Literacy|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/literacy/Documents/fs32-2015-literacy.pdf|journal=UIS Fact Sheet|volume=No. 32|access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref> Illiteracy persists to a greater extent in other regions: 2013 [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]] (UIS) data indicates adult literacy rates of only 67.55% in [[South Asia]] and [[North Africa]], 59.76% in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?queryid=166# |title=Education : Literacy rate|last=UIS|website=data.uis.unesco.org|access-date=22 May 2016}}</ref> 
[[File:Figure 5 Literacy has rapidly spread Reading the past writing the future.svg|left|thumb|Literacy has rapidly spread in several regions over the last twenty-five years.]]
In much of the world, high youth literacy rates suggest that illiteracy will become less and less common as younger generations with higher educational attainment levels replace older ones.<ref>Wagner, Daniel A., Fatima Tuz Zahra, and Jinsol Lee.

The former refers to an illiterate person who lives in a household with literates and the latter to an illiterate who lives in a household of all illiterates. What is of concern is that many people in poor nations are not proximate illiterates but rather isolated illiterates.

That being said, literacy has rapidly spread in several regions in the last twenty-five years (see image).<ref name=":4" /> The global initiative of the United Nations to actualize the [[Sustainable Development Goal 4]] is also gaining momentum.<ref>{{Cite web|title=THE 17 GOALS {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|url=https://sdgs.un.org/goals|access-date=2020-09-22|website=sdgs.un.org}}</ref>

=== Gender disparities ===

According to 2015 UIS data collected by the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]], about two-thirds (63%) of the world's illiterate adults are women. This disparity was even starker in previous decades: from 1970 to 2000, the global gender gap in literacy would decrease by roughly 50%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Dorius|first1=Shawn F.|last2=Firebaugh|first2=Glenn|date=1 July 2010|title=Trends in Global Gender Inequality|url=http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/88/5/1941|journal=Social Forces|language=en|volume=88|issue=5|pages=1941–1968|doi=10.1353/sof.2010.0040|issn=0037-7732|pmc=3107548|pmid=21643494}}</ref> In recent years, however, this progress has stagnated, with the remaining gender gap holding almost constant over the last two decades.<ref name=":0" /> In general, the gender gap in literacy is not as pronounced as the regional gap; that is, differences between countries in overall literacy are often larger than gender differences within countries.<ref>The World Bank. (2012). "[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWDR2012/Resources/7778105-1299699968583/7786210-1315936222006/chapter-3.pdf Education and Health: Where do Gender Differences Really Matter]?" in Gender Equality and Development: World Development Report 2012. Washington, D.C: The World Bank: 114.
</ref> However, the gap between men and women would narrow from 1990 onwards, after the increase of male adult literacy rates at 80 per cent (see image).<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247563e.pdf|title=Reading the past, writing the future: Fifty years of promoting literacy|last=UNESCO|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100214-4|pages=21–23, 26}}</ref>

[[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the region with the lowest overall literacy rates, also features the widest gender gap: just 52% of adult females are literate, and 68% among adult men. Similar gender disparity persists in two other regions, [[North Africa]] (86% adult male literacy, 70% adult female literacy) and South Asia (77% adult male literacy, 58% adult female literacy).<ref name=":0" />

The 1990 World Conference on [[Education For All|Education for All]], held in Jomtien, Thailand, would bring attention to the literacy gender gap and prompt many developing countries to prioritize women's literacy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWz6mAEACAAJ|title=Gender, Literacy, and Empowerment in Morocco|last=Agnaou|first=Fatima|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415947657|language=en}}</ref>

In many contexts, female illiteracy co-exists with other aspects of gender inequality. [[Martha Nussbaum]] suggests illiterate women are more vulnerable to becoming trapped in an abusive marriage, given that illiteracy limits their employment opportunities and worsens their [[intra-household bargaining]] position. Moreover, Nussbaum links literacy to the potential for women to effectively communicate and collaborate with one another in order "to participate in a larger movement for political change."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha C.|date=1 January 2004|title=Women's Education: A Global Challenge|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=29|issue=2|pages=332–333|doi=10.1086/378571|issn=0097-9740}}</ref>

==== Challenges of increasing female literacy ====

Social barriers prevent expanding literacy skills among women and girls. Making literacy classes available can be ineffective when it conflicts with the use of the valuable limited time of women and girls.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=M. Anne|last2=King|first2=Elizabeth|date=1 July 1995|title=Women's education and economic well-being|journal=Feminist Economics|volume=1|issue=2|pages=21–46|doi=10.1080/714042230|issn=1354-5701}}</ref> School age girls, in many contexts, face stronger expectations than their male counterparts to perform household work and care after younger siblings.<ref name=":2" /> Generational dynamics can also perpetuate these disparities: illiterate parents may not readily appreciate the value of literacy for their daughters, particularly in traditional, rural societies with expectations that girls will remain at home.<ref>Al-Mekhlafy, Tawfiq A. (2008).

A 2015 [[World Bank]] and the [[International Center for Research on Women]] review of academic literature would conclude that [[child marriage]], which predominantly impacts girls, tends to reduce literacy levels.<ref>Wodon, Quentin, et al. "Child Marriage and the 2030 Agenda: Selected Findings from Early Research." (September 2015).

==== Gender gap for boys in developed countries ====

While women and girls comprise the majority of the global illiterate population, in many developed countries a literacy gender gap exists in the opposite direction. Data from the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) has consistently indicated the literacy underachievement of boys within member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Anne|last2=Kehler|first2=Michael|last3=Martino|first3=Wayne|date=1 February 2010|title=The Problem of Boys' Literacy Underachievement: Raising Some Questions|journal=Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy|language=en|volume=53|issue=5|pages=356–361|doi=10.1598/JAAL.53.5.1|issn=1936-2706}}</ref> In view of such findings, many education specialists have recommended changes in classroom practices to better accommodate boys' learning styles, and to remove any gender stereotypes that may create a perception of reading and writing as feminine activities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Senn|first=Nicole|date=1 November 2012|title=Effective Approaches to Motivate and Engage Reluctant Boys in Literacy|journal=The Reading Teacher|language=en|volume=66|issue=3|pages=211–220|doi=10.1002/TRTR.01107|issn=1936-2714}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZHAAAAACAAJ|title=Me Read?

===Socioeconomic impact===
Many policy analysts consider literacy rates as a crucial measure of the value of a region's [[human capital]]. For example, literate people can be more easily trained than illiterate people, and generally have a higher socioeconomic status;<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.thephonicspage.org/On%20Phonics/profitable.html|title = Phonics.

=== Health impacts ===
Print illiteracy generally corresponds with less knowledge about modern hygiene and nutritional practices, an unawareness which can exacerbate a wide range of health issues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Puchner|first=Laurel D.|date=1 July 1995|title=Literacy links: Issues in the relationship between early childhood development, health, women, families, and literacy|journal=International Journal of Educational Development|volume=15|issue=3|pages=307–319|doi=10.1016/0738-0593(94)00041-M}}</ref> Within developing countries in particular, literacy rates also have implications for [[child mortality]]; in these contexts, children of literate mothers are 50% more likely to live past age 5 than children of illiterate mothers.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://worldliteracyfoundation.org//wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WLF-FINAL-ECONOMIC-REPORT.pdf|title=The Economic and Social Cost of Illiteracy: A Snapshot of Illiteracy in a Global Context|date=24 August 2015|publisher=World Literacy Foundation|access-date=2 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421083037/http://worldliteracyfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/WLF-FINAL-ECONOMIC-REPORT.pdf|archive-date=21 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Public health research has thus increasingly concerned itself with the potential for literacy skills to allow women to more successfully access health care systems, and thereby facilitate gains in child health.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=LeVine|first1=Robert A.|last2=Rowe|first2=Meredith L.|title=Maternal Literacy and Child Health in Less-Developed Countries: Evidence, Processes, and Limitations|journal=Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics|volume=30|issue=4|pages=340–349|doi=10.1097/dbp.0b013e3181b0eeff|pmid=19672161|year=2009|s2cid=21609263|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:13041198}}</ref>

For example, a 2014 descriptive research survey project correlates literacy levels with the socioeconomic status of women in Oyo State, Nigeria. The study claims that developing literacy in this area will bring "economic empowerment and will encourage rural women to practice hygiene, which will in turn lead to the reduction of birth and death rates."<ref>OKOJI, O. F., & LADEJI, O. O. (2014). Influence of Adult Literacy Education on Socio-Economic Empowerment of Rural Women in Oyo State, Nigeria. Gender & Behaviour, 12(3), 6016-6026.</ref>

=== Economic impacts ===
Literacy can increase job opportunities and access to [[higher education]]. In 2009, the National Adult Literacy agency (NALA) in [[Ireland]] commissioned a cost benefit analysis of adult literacy training. This concluded that there were economic gains for the individuals, the companies they worked for, and the Exchequer, as well as the economy and the country as a whole—for example, increased [[GDP]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nala.ie/sites/default/files/press_release_image-2010-March/files/Policy%20Brief%20on%20Adult%20Literacy%20Strategy%202009.pdf |title=nala.ie |accessdate=23 November 2011 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723224750/http://www.nala.ie/sites/default/files/press_release_image-2010-March/files/Policy%20Brief%20on%20Adult%20Literacy%20Strategy%202009.pdf |archive-date=23 July 2011  }}</ref> [[Andrey Korotayev|Korotayev]] and coauthors have revealed a rather significant correlation between the level of literacy in the early 19th century and successful modernization and economic breakthroughs in the late 20th century, as "literate people could be characterized by a greater innovative-activity level, which provides opportunities for modernization, development, and economic growth".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Korotayev | first1 = Andrey | last2 = Zinkina | first2 = Julia | last3 = Bogevolnov | first3 = Justislav | last4 = Malkov | first4 = Artemy | title = Global Unconditional Convergence among Larger Economies after 1998? | url = http://www.sociostudies.org/journal/articles/140671/| journal = Journal of Globalization Studies | volume = 2 | issue = 2| year = 2011 }}</ref>

=== Literacy promotion efforts ===
While informal learning within the home can play an important role in literacy development, gains in childhood literacy often occur in primary school settings. Continuing the global expansion of public education is thus a frequent focus of literacy advocates.<ref>Wagner, Daniel A., Fatima Tuz Zahra, and Jinsol Lee. (2016).

</ref> These kinds of broad improvements in education often require centralized efforts undertaken by national governments; alternatively, local literacy projects implemented by NGOs can play an important role, particularly in rural contexts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Beckman|first1=Paula J.|last2=Gallo|first2=Jessica|date=October 2015|title=Rural Education in a Global Context|url=http://ger.mercy.edu/index.php/ger/article/view/238|journal=Global Education Review|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|page=7|issn=2325-663X|access-date=23 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625015250/http://ger.mercy.edu/index.php/ger/article/view/238|archive-date=25 June 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Funding for both youth and adult literacy programs often comes from large international development organizations.

=== Literacy as a development indicator ===
[[File:Youth and adult literacy rate, 2000–2016 and projections to 2030.svg|thumb|Youth and adult literacy rate, 2000–2016 and projections to 2030]]
The [[Human Development Index]], produced by the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), uses education as one of its three indicators; originally, adult literacy represented two-thirds of this education index weight. In 2010, however, the UNDP replaced the adult literacy measure with mean years of schooling. A 2011 UNDP research paper framed this change as a way to "ensure current relevance," arguing that gains in global literacy already achieved between 1970 and 2010 meant that literacy would be "unlikely to be as informative of the future."<ref>Klugman, Jeni, Francisco Rodriguez, and Hyung-Jin Choi.

=== Literacy as a human right ===
Unlike medieval times, when reading and writing skills were restricted to a few elites and the clergy, these literacy skills are now expected from every member of a society.<ref name="dspace.unza.zm"/> Literacy is a human right essential for lifelong learning and social change. As supported by the 1996 Report of the International Commission on Education for the Twenty-First Century, and the 1997 Hamburg Declaration: ‘Literacy, broadly conceived as the basic knowledge and skills needed by all in a rapidly changing world, is a fundamental human right. (...) There are millions, the majority of whom are women, who lack opportunities to learn or who have insufficient skills to be able to assert this right. The challenge is to enable them to do so. This will often imply the creation of preconditions for learning through awareness raising and empowerment. Literacy is also a catalyst for participation in social, cultural, political and economic activities, and for learning throughout life’.<ref>UNESCO 1997.

===30 April: Dia! Diversity in Action===

Dia!

===READ/Orange County===

This community literacy program was initiated in 1992 by the [[Orange County Public Libraries|Orange County Public Library]] in [[California]].  The mission of READ/Orange County is to "create a more literate community by providing diversified services of the highest quality to all who seek them." Potential tutors train during an extensive 23-hour tutor training workshop in which they learn the philosophy, techniques and tools they will need to work with adult learns.<ref name="Selnick, S." /> After the training, the tutors invest at least 50 hours a year to tutoring their student.The organization builds on people's experience as well as education rather than trying to make up for what has not been learned. The program seeks to equip students with skills to continue learning in the future.<ref name="Selnick, S." /> The guiding philosophy is that an adult who learns to read creates a [[ripple effect]] in the community.  The person becomes an example to children and grandchildren and can better serve the community.

===BoulderReads!===

Located in [[Boulder, Colorado]], the program recognized the difficulty that students had in obtaining child care while attending tutoring sessions, and joined with the University of Colorado to provide reading buddies to the children of students. Reading Buddies matches children of adult literacy students with college students who meet with them once a week throughout the semester for an hour and a half. The college students receive course credit to try to enhance the quality and reliability of their time.<ref name="Sherry, D.">{{cite journal | last1 = Sherry | first1 = D | year = 2004 | title = ["Providing reading buddies for the children of adult literacy students: One way to provide onsite child care while also addressing intergenerational illiteracy"] | journal = Colorado Libraries | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 40–42 }}</ref> Each Reading Buddies session focuses primarily on the [[college student]] reading aloud with the child. The goal is to help the child gain interest in books and feel comfortable reading aloud. Time is also spent on word games, writing letters, or searching for books in the library. Throughout the semester the pair work on writing and illustrating a book together. The college student's grade is partly dependent on the completion of the book. Although Reading Buddies began primarily as an answer to the lack of child care for literacy students, it has evolved into another aspect of the program.<ref name="Sherry, D." /> Participating children show marked improvement in their reading and writing skills throughout the semester.

===Hillsborough Literacy Council (HLC)===

Approximately 120,000 adults in Hillsborough County are illiterate or read below the fourth-grade level; According to 2003 Census statistics, 15 percent of Hillsborough County residents age 16 and older lacked basic prose literacy skills.<ref>DANIELS, E.

Using library space, the HLC provides tutoring for [[English as a second or foreign language|English for speakers of other languages]] (ESOL) in small groups or one-on-one tutoring. Through one-on-one tutoring, the organization works to help adult students reach at least the fifth-grade level in reading.  The organization also provides volunteer-run conversation groups for English practice.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://hillsboroughliteracy.org/learn/english-practice/ |title = English Practice Groups – Hillsborough Literacy Council}}</ref>

==Teaching literacy==
{{main|Learning to read}}
[[File:Brain pathways for mirror discrimination learning during literacy acquisition.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Brain areas involved in literacy acquisition]]
{{globalize|section|date=April 2011}}
Critiques of autonomous models of literacy notwithstanding, the belief that [[reading (process)|reading]] development is key to literacy remains dominant, at least in the United States, where it is understood as progression of skills that begins with the ability to understand spoken words and decode written words, and that culminates in the deep understanding of text. Reading development involves a range of complex language-underpinnings including awareness of speech sounds ([[phonology]]), spelling patterns ([[orthography]]), word meaning ([[semantics]]), grammar, ([[syntax]]) and patterns of word formation ([[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]), all of which provide a necessary platform for reading [[fluency]] and comprehension.

Once these skills are acquired, it is maintained, a reader can attain full language literacy, which includes the abilities to apply to printed material critical analysis, inference and synthesis; to write with accuracy and coherence; and to use information and insights from text as the basis for informed decisions and creative thought.<ref>Margie Gillis, Ed.D., President, Literacy How, Inc., and Research Affiliate, Haskins Laboratories at Yale University; Sally Grimes, Ed.M., Executive Director, Literate Nation and Founder, Grimes Reading Institute; Cinthia Haan, Author and Chair, The Haan Foundation for Children and President, Power4Kids Reading Initiative; Peggy McCardle, Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief, Child Development and Behavior Branch, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Louisa Moats, Ed.D., President, Moats Associates Consulting, Inc.; Anthony Pedriana, Author and retired urban schoolteacher and principal; Susan Smartt, Ph.D., Senior Research Associate, National Comprehensive Center for Teacher Quality, Vanderbilt University; Catherine Snow,  Ph.D., Author, Researcher and Professor of Education,  Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard University; Cheryl Ward, M.S.M., C.A.L.P., Co-founder of Wisconsin Reading Coalition and academic language practitioner; Maryanne Wolf, Ed.D., Author and Director, Center for Reading and Language Research, Tufts University.</ref>{{full citation needed|date=April 2019}}

For this reason, teaching English literacy in the [[United States]] is dominated by a focus on a set of discrete decoding skills. From this perspective, literacy—or, rather, reading—comprises a number of subskills that can be taught to students. These skill sets include [[phonological awareness]], [[phonics|phonics (decoding)]], [[fluency]], [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]], and [[vocabulary]]. Mastering each of these subskills is necessary for students to become proficient readers.<ref>{{Cite journal|author = National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|title = Report of the National Reading Panel: Teaching Children to Read: An Evidence-Based Assessment of the Scientific Research Literature on Reading and its Implications for Reading Instruction: Reports of the Subgroups|publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office|year = 2000}}</ref>

From this same perspective, readers of [[alphabetic language]]s must understand the [[alphabetic principle]] to master basic reading skills. For this purpose a writing system is "alphabetic" if it uses symbols to represent [[phoneme|individual language sounds]],<ref name="sedl">{{cite web|url=http://www.sedl.org/reading/framework/glossary.html |title=Glossary of Reading Terms - The Cognitive Foundations of Learning to Read: A Framework |publisher=Sedl.org |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> though the degree of correspondence between letters and sounds varies between alphabetic languages. [[Syllabary|Syllabic writing systems]] (such as [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kana]]) use a symbol to represent a single syllable, and [[logogram|logographic writing systems]] (such as [[Written Chinese|Chinese]]) use a symbol to represent a [[morpheme]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Paul Halsall |url=http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/chinlng4.html |title=Chinese Cultural Studies: Chinese Logographic Writing |publisher=Acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu |accessdate=23 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927232215/http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/chinlng4.html |archive-date=27 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

There are any number of approaches to teaching literacy;<ref>Carter, V. Elaine. (November 2000). [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001257/125767eb.pdf “New approaches to literacy learning: A guide for teacher educators.”] UNESCO. www.un.org/ga/president/62/ThematicDebates/adn/crimeimpedimentsd.pdf.</ref> each is shaped by its informing assumptions about what literacy is and how it is best learned by students. [[Phonics]] instruction, for example, focuses on reading at the level of the word. It teaches readers to observe and interpret the letters or groups of letters that make up words. A common method of teaching phonics is [[synthetic phonics]], in which a novice reader pronounces each individual sound and "blends" them to pronounce the whole word. Another approach is embedded phonics instruction, used more often in [[whole language]] reading instruction, in which novice readers learn about the individual letters in words on a just-in-time, just-in-place basis that is tailored to meet each student's reading and writing learning needs.<ref name="sedl" /> That is, teachers provide phonics instruction opportunistically, within the context of stories or student writing that feature many instances of a particular letter or group of letters. Embedded instruction combines letter-sound knowledge with the use of meaningful context to read new and difficult words.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ldonline.org/glossary#E |title=Glossary |publisher=LD OnLine |accessdate=23 November 2011}}</ref> Techniques such as [[directed listening and thinking activity|directed listening and thinking activities]] can be used to aid children in learning how to read and [[reading comprehension]].

In a 2012 proposal, it has been claimed that reading can be acquired naturally if print is constantly available at an early age in the same manner as spoken language.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Massaro | first1 = D. W. | year = 2012 | title = Acquiring Literacy Naturally: Behavioral science and technology could empower preschool children to learn to read naturally without instruction | url = http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/2012/4/acquiring-literacy-naturally| journal = American Scientist | volume = 100 | issue = 4| pages = 324–333 | doi = 10.1511/2012.97.324 }}</ref> If an appropriate form of written text is made available before formal schooling begins, reading should be learned inductively, emerge naturally, and with no significant negative consequences. This proposal challenges the commonly held belief that written language requires formal instruction and schooling. Its success would change current views of literacy and schooling. Using developments in behavioral science and technology, an interactive system (Technology Assisted Reading Acquisition, TARA) would enable young pre-literate children to accurately perceive and learn properties of written language by simple exposure to the written form.

In Australia a number of State governments have introduced Reading Challenges to improve literacy. The Premier's Reading Challenge in South Australia, launched by Premier Mike Rann has one of the highest participation rates in the world for reading challenges. It has been embraced by more than 95% of public, private and religious schools.<ref>Center for National Policy, Washington DC, What States Can Do, 2 May 2012</ref>

===Post-conflict settings===

Programs have been implemented in regions that have an ongoing conflict or in a post-conflict stage. The Norwegian Refugee Council Pack program has been used in 13 post-conflict countries since 2003. The program organizers believe that daily routines and other wise predictable activities help the transition from war to peace.  Learners can select one area in vocational training for a year-long period.  They complete required courses in [[agriculture]], life skills, literacy and numeracy.  Results have shown that active participation and management of the members of the program are important to the success of the program. These programs share the use of integrated basic education, e.g. literacy, numeracy, scientific knowledge, local history and culture, native and mainstream language skills, and apprenticeships.<ref name=Bernhardt/>

===Teaching non-native users===
Although there is considerable awareness that language deficiencies (lacking proficiency) are disadvantageous to immigrants settling in a new country, there appears to be a lack of pedagogical approaches that address the instruction of literacy to migrant English language learners (ELLs). Harvard scholar Catherine Snow (2001) called for a gap to be addresses: "The TESOL field needs a concerted research effort to inform literacy instruction for such children ... to determine when to start literacy instruction and how to adapt it to the LS reader's needs".<ref>{{cite journal|last =Snow|first = Catherine|date = Winter 2001 |title = Learning to Read in an L2|journal = TESOL Quarterly|volume = 35|issue = 4|pages =599–601|doi = 10.2307/3588432 |jstor = 3588432}}</ref> The scenario becomes more complex when there is no choice in such decisions as in the case of the current migration trends with citizens from the Middle East and Africa being relocated to English majority nations due to various political or social reasons. Recent developments to address the gap in teaching literacy to second or foreign language learners has been ongoing and promising results have been shown by Pearson and Pellerine (2010)<ref>Pearson and Pellerine (2010) Teaching for Understanding in Higher Education: A Framework for Developing Literacy within a TESOL Context. http://marifa.hct.ac.ae/2010/100 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022085359/http://marifa.hct.ac.ae/2010/100 |date=22 October 2017 }}</ref> which integrates Teaching for Understanding, a curricular framework from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. A series of pilot projects had been carried out in the Middle East and Africa (see Patil, 2016).<ref name="cbc.ca">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/canadian-teacher-literacy-visual-arts-1.3635661|title=How an educator from Nova Scotia uses cameras to teach English in Ethiopia}}</ref> In this work significant interest from the learners perspective have been noticed through the integration of visual arts as springboards for literacy oriented instruction. In one case migrant women had been provided with cameras and a walking tour of their local village was provided to the instructor as the women photographed their tour focusing on places and activities that would later be used for writings about their daily life. In essence a narrative of life. Other primers for writing activities include: painting, sketching, and other craft projects (e.g. gluing activities).

[[File:Sample sketch of milestone.jpg|thumb|right|Sample milestone sketch]]

A series of pilot studies were carried out to investigate alternatives to instructing literacy to migrant ELLs,<ref name="stephenpellerin4.wixsite.com">{{cite web|url=http://stephenpellerin4.wixsite.com/altlit|title=Alternative Literacy|first = Stephen|last = Pellerine}}</ref> starting from simple trials aiming to test the teaching of photography to participants with no prior photography background, to isolating painting and sketching activities that could later be integrated into a larger pedagogical initiative. In efforts to develop alternative approaches for literacy instruction utilising visual arts, work was carried out with Afghan labourers, Bangladeshi tailors, Emirati media students, internal Ethiopian migrants (both labourers and university students), and a street child.<ref name="cbc.ca"/><ref name="stephenpellerin4.wixsite.com"/><ref name="elgazette.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.elgazette.com/item/296-why-every-picture-tells-a-story.html|title=Why every picture tells a story - EL Gazette|first=Andrea|last=Perez|access-date=7 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913135001/http://www.elgazette.com/item/296-why-every-picture-tells-a-story.html|archive-date=13 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

It should be pointed out that in such challenging contexts sometimes the teaching of literacy may have unforeseen barriers. The ''EL Gazette'' reported that in the trials carried out in Ethiopia, for example, it was found that all ten of the participants had problems with vision.<ref name="elgazette.com"/> In order to overcome this, or to avoid such challenges, preliminary health checks can help inform pre-teaching in order to better assist in the teaching/learning of literacy.

In a visual arts approach to literacy instruction a benefit can be the inclusion of both a traditional literacy approach (reading and writing) while at the same time addressing 21st Century digital literacy instruction through the inclusion of digital cameras and posting images onto the web. Many scholars<ref>https://calico.org/bookfiles/pdfs/DigitalLiteracies.pdf{{Dead link|date=April 2019}}</ref> feel that the inclusion of digital literacy is necessary to include under the traditional umbrella of literacy instruction specifically when engaging second language learners. (Also see: [[Digital literacy]].)<ref>Hutchison and Woodward (2013). A Planning Cycle for Integrating Digital Technology Into Literacy Instruction. TOC. Volume 67, Issue 6 March 2014 Pages 455–464</ref> 

Other ways in which visual arts have been integrated into literacy instruction for migrant populations include integrating aspects of visual art with the blending of core curricular goals.

===Teaching migrant/immigrant language users===

A more pressing challenge in education is the instruction of literacy to Migrant English Language Learners (MELLs), a term coined by Pellerine. It is not just limited to English. “Due to the growing share of immigrants in many Western societies, there has been increasing concern for the degree to which immigrants acquire language that is spoken in the destination country” (Tubergen 2006).<ref>Tubergen, F. (2006). Immigrant Integration: A Cross National Study. Scholarly Publishing</ref> Remembering that teaching literacy to a native in their L1 can be challenging, and the challenge becomes more cognitively demanding when in a second language (L2), the task can become considerably more difficult when confronted with a migrant who has made a sudden change (migrated) and requires the second language upon arrival in the country of destination. In many instances a migrant will not have the opportunity, for many obvious reasons, to start school again at grade one and acquire the language naturally. In these situations alternative interventions need to take place.

In working with illiterate people (and individuals with low-proficiency in an L2) following the composition of some artifact like in taking a photo, sketching an event, or painting an image, a stage of orality has been seen as an effective way to understand the intention of the learner.

[[File:Including Orality.jpg|thumb|centre|Including orality]]

In the accompanying image from left to right a) an image taken during a phototour of the participant's village. This image is of the individual at her shop, and this is one of her products that she sells, dung for cooking fuel. The image helps the interlocutor understand the realities of the participants daily life and most importantly it allows the participant the opportunity to select what they feel is important to them. b) This is an image of a student explaining and elaborating the series of milestones in her life to a group. In this image the student had a very basic ability and with some help was able to write brief captions under the images. While she speaks a recording of her story takes place to understand her story and to help develop it in the L2. The third image is of a painting that had been used with a composite in Photoshop. With further training participants can learn how to blend images they would like to therefore introducing elements of digital literacies, beneficial in many spheres of life in the 21st century.<ref>Warschauer, Mark; Matuchniak, Tina (2010). "New Technology and Digital Worlds: Analyzing Evidence of Equity in Access, Use, and Outcomes". Review of Research in Education. 34: 179–225. {{doi|10.3102/0091732X09349791}}</ref>

In the following image (see right) you can see two samples 1) One in Ethiopia from stencil to more developed composition based on a village tour, photography, and paintings. 2) In the Middle East at a tailor's shop focusing English for Specific Purposes (ESP) and in this example the writing has evolved from photography, sketching, and in situ exposure for the instructor (much like the village tour in sample one).

From the work based in Ethiopia, participants were asked to rate preference of activity, on a scale of 1-10. The survey prompt was: On a scale of 1 - 10 how would you rate photography as an activity that helped you get inspiration for your writing activities (think of enjoyment and usefulness). The following activities were rated, in order of preference - activities used as primers for writing:

* Photography 97%
* Oral presentations sharing your art 92%
* Process painting 84%
* Painting 82%
* Sketching 78% 
* Gluing activities 72%
* Stencil/tracing activities 60%

More research would need to be conducted to confirm such trends.

In bringing work together from students in culminating projects, authorship programs have been successful in bringing student work together in book format. Such artifacts can be used to both document learning, but more importantly reinforce language and content goals.

[[File:Covers for Authorship Initiatives to Promote Literacy via Visual Art with ELLs.jpg|thumb|right|Sample covers of completed authorship created books]]

The culmination of such writings, into books can evoke both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Form feedback by students involved in such initiatives the responses have indicated that the healthy pressures of collective and collaborative work was beneficial.

===Importance===

Teaching people to read and write, in a traditional sense of the meaning (literacy) is a very complex task in a native language. To do this in a second language becomes increasingly more complex, and in the case of migrants relocating to another country there can be legal and policy driven boundaries that prohibit the naturalization and acquisition of citizen ship based on language proficiency. In Canada<ref>Pagtakhan (2016). Language requirement for citizenship unnecessary, Reis Pagtakhan writes: Immigrants must pass a language test to become Canadian citizens years after they arrive. CBC News, retrieved at: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/immigration-language-requirement-reis-pagtakhan-1.3568590 on 27 May 2017.</ref> for example despite a debate, language tests are required years after settling into Canada.

The ''EL Gazette'' reviewed Pellerine's work with migrant English language learners<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.elgazette.com/june-2017/the-art-of-teaching.html|title=The art of teaching - ELgazette|website=digital.elgazette.com|access-date=17 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620153815/http://digital.elgazette.com/june-2017/the-art-of-teaching.html|archive-date=20 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> and commented: "Handing English language learners a sponge and some paint and asking them to ‘paint what comes’ might not appear like a promising teaching method for a foreign language. But Canadian EL instructor and photographer Steve Pellerine has found that the technique, along with others based around the visual arts, has helped some of his most challenging groups to learn". Visual arts have been viewed as an effective way to approach literacy instruction - the art being primers for subsequent literacy tasks within a scaffolded curricular design, such at Teaching for Understanding (TfU) or Understanding by Design (UbD).

===Europe===
====United Kingdom====
Nearly one in ten young adult women have poor reading and writing skills in the UK in the 21st century. This seriously damages their employment prospects and many are trapped in poverty. Lack of reading skill is a social stigma and women tend to hide their difficulty rather than seeking help.  Girls on average do better than boys at English in school.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-45435973|title = Kate Winslet warns of 'shame' of illiteracy|work =[[BBC]]|first = Sean |last = Coughlan|date = 7 September 2018}}</ref>  

=====England=====
Literacy is first documented in the area of modern England on 24 September 54 BCE, on which day [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Quintus Cicero]] wrote to [[Cicero]] "from the nearest shores of Britain".<ref>R.S.O. Tomlin. Writing and Communication. In Artefacts in Roman Britain, their purpose and use. Lindsay Allason-Jones ed. Cambridge University Press 2011. page 133. {{ISBN|978-0-521-86012-3}}</ref> Literacy was widespread under Roman rule, but became very rare, limited almost entirely to churchmen, after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. In 12th and 13th century England, the ability to recite a particular passage from the Bible in [[Latin]] entitled a [[common law]] defendant to the so-called [[benefit of clergy]]: i.e. trial before an [[ecclesiastical court]], where sentences were more lenient, instead of a secular one, where hanging was a likely sentence. Thus literate lay defendants often claimed benefit of clergy, while an illiterate person who had memorized the psalm used as the literacy test, [[Psalm 51]] ("O God, have mercy upon me..."), could also claim benefit of clergy.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Baker, John R. |title=An Introduction to English Legal History |publisher=Butterworths LexisNexis |location=London |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-406-93053-8 }}</ref> Despite lacking a system of free and compulsory primary schooling, England reached near universal literacy in the 19th century as a result of shared, informal learning provided by family members, fellow workers, and/or benevolent employers. Even with near universal literacy rates, the gap between male and female literacy rates persisted until the early 20th century. Many women in the West during the 19th century were able to read, but unable to write.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|page=98|edition=2nd}}</ref>

=====Wales=====
Formal higher education in the arts and sciences in [[Wales]], from the Middle Ages to the 18th century, was the preserve of the wealthy and the [[clergy]]. As in England, Welsh history and archaeological finds dating back to the [[Bronze Age]] reveal not only reading and writing, but also [[alchemy]], [[botany]], advanced maths and science. Following the Roman occupation and the conquest by the English, education in Wales was at a very low ebb in the early modern period; in particular, formal education was only available in English while the majority of the population spoke only [[Welsh language|Welsh]]. The first modern grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as [[Ruthin]], [[Brecon]], and [[Cowbridge]]. One of the first modern national education methods to use the native Welsh language was started by [[Griffith Jones (Llanddowror)|Griffith Jones]] in 1731.<ref>For more information see [[History of Wales#Early modern period]]</ref> Jones was the rector of [[Llanddowror]] from 1716 and remained there for the rest of his life. He organized and introduced a Welsh medium circulating school system, which was attractive and effective for Welsh speakers, while also teaching them English, which gave them access to broader educational sources. The circulating schools may have taught half the country's population to read. Literacy rates in Wales by the mid-18th century were one of the highest.
[[File:Adriaen van Ostade 007.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|Dutch schoolmaster and children, 1662]]

====Continental Europe====
The ability to read did not necessarily imply the ability to write. The [[Swedish Church Law 1686|1686 church law]] (''kyrkolagen'') of the Kingdom of [[Sweden]] (which at the time included all of modern Sweden, [[Finland]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]]) enforced literacy on the people, and by 1800 the ability to read was close to 100%. This was directly dependent on the need to read religious texts in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran faith]] in [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. As a result, literacy in these countries was inclined towards reading, specifically.<ref name="Books: A Living History">{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|page=97|edition=2nd}}</ref> But as late as the 19th century, many Swedes, especially women, could not write. The exception to this rule were the men and women of [[Iceland]] who achieved widespread literacy without formal schooling, libraries, or printed books via informal tuition by religious leaders and peasant teachers.<ref name="Books: A Living History" /> That said, the situation in England was far worse than in [[Scandinavia]], [[France]], and [[Prussia]]: as late as 1841, 33% of all Englishmen and 44% of Englishwomen signed marriage certificates with their [[Signature#Function and types of signatures|mark]] as they were unable to write (government-financed public education was not available in England until 1870 and, even then, on a limited basis){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}.

Historian [[Ernest Gellner]] argues that [[Continental Europe]]an countries were far more successful in implementing educational reform precisely because their governments were more willing to invest in the population as a whole.<ref>{{Cite book|author= Ernest Gellner |title=Nations and Nationalism |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-8014-9263-1}}</ref> Government oversight allowed countries to standardize curriculum and secure funding through legislation thus enabling educational programs to have a broader reach.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Literacy in early modern Europe : culture and education, 1500-1800|last=Houston|first=Rab|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780582368101|edition=2nd |location=Oxfordshire, England|oclc=884586117}}</ref>

Although the present-day concepts of literacy have much to do with the 15th-century invention of the [[movable type]] [[printing press]], it was not until the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the mid-19th century that paper and books became affordable to all classes of industrialized society. Until then, only a small percentage of the population were literate as only wealthy individuals and institutions could afford the materials. Even {{As of|2008|alt=today}}, the cost of paper and books is a barrier to universal literacy in some less-industrialized nations.

On the other hand, historian [[Harvey Graff]] argues that the introduction of [[Compulsory education|mass schooling]] was in part an effort to control the type of literacy that the [[working class]] had access to. According to Graff, literacy learning was increasing outside of formal settings (such as schools) and this uncontrolled, potentially critical reading could lead to increased radicalization of the populace. In his view, mass schooling was meant to temper and control literacy, not spread it.<ref name="Graff1991">{{Cite book|last=Graff|first=Harvey J. |title=The literacy myth: cultural integration and social structure in the nineteenth century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AAj9sM99qekC|year=1991|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-88738-884-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AAj9sM99qekC&pg=PR26 xxvi]}}</ref> Graff also points out, using the example of Sweden, that mass literacy can be achieved without formal schooling or instruction in writing.

=====Colonialism (1600s–1762)=====

Research on the literacy rates of Canadians in the colonial days rested largely on examinations of the proportion of signatures to marks on parish acts (birth, baptismal, and marriage registrations).  Although some researchers have concluded that signature counts drawn from marriage registers in nineteenth century [[France]] corresponded closely with literacy tests given to military conscripts,<ref>{{cite book|last=Furet|first=François|title=Lire et écrire: l'alphabétisation des Français de Calvin à Jules Ferry|year=1977|publisher=Editions de Minuit|location=Paris|page=353}}</ref> others regard this methodology as a "relatively unimaginative treatment of the complex practices and events that might be described as literacy" (Curtis, 2007, p.&nbsp;1-2).<ref name="curtis1">{{cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Bruce|title=Beyond Signature Literacy: New Research Directions|journal=Historical Studies in Education |year=2007|issue=Fall Special Issue|pages=1–12|url=http://historicalstudiesineducation.ca/index.php/edu_hse-rhe/article/view/533/734|accessdate=23 October 2012|volume=19}}</ref>  But censuses (dating back to 1666) and official records of [[New France]] offer few clues of their own on the population's levels of literacy, therefore leaving few options in terms of materials from which to draw literary rate estimates.

In his research of literacy rates of males and females in New France, Trudel found that in 1663, of 1,224 persons in New France who were of marriageable age, 59% of grooms and 46% of brides wrote their name; however, of the 3,000-plus colony inhabitants, less than 40% were native born.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Magnuson|first=Roger|title=Two myths in New France education|journal=McGill Journal of Education|year=1985|volume=20|issue=3|url=http://mje.mcgill.ca/index.php/MJE/article/viewArticle/7636|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref> Signature rates were therefore likely more reflective of rates of literacy among French immigrants. Magnuson's (1985) research revealed a trend: signature rates for the period of 1680–1699 were 42% for males, 30% for females; in 1657-1715, they were 45% for males and 43% for females; in 1745-1754, they were higher for females than for males. He believed that this upward trend in rates of females’ ability to sign documents was largely attributed to the larger number of female religious orders, and to the proportionately more active role of women in health and education, while the roles of male religious orders were largely to serve as parish priests, [[Missionary|missionaries]], military chaplains and explorers. 1752 marked the date that Canada's first newspaper—the ''[[Halifax Gazette]]''—began publication.<ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia1">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Newspapers|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/newspapers|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica-Dominion Institute}}</ref>

=====From the British Conquest (1763) to Confederation (1867)=====

The end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763 allowed two [[Philadelphia]] printers to come to [[Quebec City|Québec City]] and to begin printing a bilingual ''[[Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph|Quebec Gazette]]'' in 1764, while in 1785 [[Fleury Mesplet]] started publication of the ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'', which is now the oldest continuing newspaper in the country.<ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia1"/>

In the 19th century, everything about print changed, and literature in its many forms became much more available.<ref name=Aliaga-Buchenau>{{cite book|last=Aliaga-Buchenau|first=Ana-Isabel|title=Dangerous Potential of Reading: Readers and the Negotiation of Power in Selected Nineteenth-Century Narratives|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-96833-1|page=202|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/oculbrock/docDetail.action?docID=10098857}}</ref> But educating the Canadian population in reading and writing was nevertheless a huge challenge. Concerned about the strong [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] presence in the colony, the British authorities repeatedly tried to help establish schools that were outside the control of religious authorities, but these efforts were largely undermined by the [[Catholic Church]] and later the Anglican clergy.<ref name="History of Education TCE">{{cite encyclopedia|title=History of Education|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/history-of-education|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica-Dominion Institute|accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref>

From the early 1820s in [[Lower Canada]], classical college curriculum, which was monopolized by the Church, was also subject to growing liberal and lay criticism, arguing it was fit first and foremost to produce priests, when Lower Canadians needed to be able to compete effectively with foreign industry and commerce and with the immigrants who were monopolizing trade (Curtis, 1985).<ref name="curtis1"/>  Liberal and lay attempts to promote parish schools generated a reaction from the Catholic and later the Anglican clergy in which the dangers of popular literacy figured centrally.<ref name="History of Education TCE" />  Both churches shared an opposition to any educational plan that encouraged lay reading of the Bible, and spokesmen for both warned of the evil and demoralizing tendencies of unregulated reading in general. Granted the power to organize parish schooling through the Vestry School Act of 1824, the Catholic clergy did nothing effective.<ref name="curtis1"/>

Despite this, the invention of the printing press had laid the foundation for the modern era and universal social literacy, and so it is that with time, "technologically, literacy had passed from the hands of an elite to the populace at large. Historical factors and sociopolitical conditions, however, have determined the extent to which universal social literacy has come to pass".<ref name=Thomas>Audrey M. Thomas, "[http://www.nald.ca/library/research/athomas/aduill/cover.htm Adult Illiteracy in Canada—A Challenge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719041330/http://www.nald.ca/library/research/athomas/aduill/cover.htm |date=19 July 2012 }}" (Ottawa: Canadian Commission for UNESCO, Occasional Paper 42, 1983).</ref>

=====1868–1986=====
In 1871 only about half of French Canadian men in [[Canada]] self-reported that they were literate, whereas 90 percent of other Canadian men said they could read and write, but information from the Canadian Families Project sample of the 1901 [[Census in Canada|Census of Canada]] indicated that literacy rates for French Canadians and other Canadians increased, as measured by the ability of men between the ages of 16 and 65 to answer literacy questions.<ref name="Green, A.">{{cite journal|last=Green|first=A|author2=MacKinnon, M. |author3=Minns, C. |title=Conspicuous by their absence: French Canadians and the settlement of the Canadian West|journal=The Journal of Economic History|year=2005|volume=65|issue=3|pages=822–849|jstor=3875019|doi=10.1017/S0022050705000306|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Economics/staff/minnsc/research/jeh_galley_proofs.pdf}}</ref> Compulsory attendance in schools was legislated in the late 19th century in all provinces but [[Quebec]], but by then, a change in parental attitudes towards educating the new generation meant that many children were already attending regularly.<ref name="History of Education TCE"/>  Unlike the emphasis of school promoters on character formation, the shaping of values, the inculcation of political and social attitudes, and proper behaviour, many parents supported schooling because they wanted their children to learn to read, write, and do [[arithmetic]].<ref name="History of Education TCE"/> Efforts were made to exert power and religious, moral, economic/professional, and social/cultural influence over children who were learning to read by dictating the contents of their school readers accordingly. But educators broke from these spheres of influence and also taught literature from a more child-centred perspective: for the pleasure of it.<ref name=Murphy>{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Sharon|title=Regaining Pleasure in the Teaching of Reading|journal=Language Arts|year=2012|volume=89|issue=5|pages=318–328|url=http://www.ncte.org/journals/la/issues/v89-5|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>

Educational change in Québec began as a result of a major commission of inquiry at the start of what came to be called the "[[Quiet Revolution]]" in the early 1960s.  In response to the resulting recommendations, the Québec government revamped the school system in an attempt to enhance the francophone population's general educational level and to produce a better-qualified labour force. Catholic Church leadership was rejected in favour of government administration and vastly increased budgets were given to school boards across the province.<ref name="History of Education TCE"/>

With time, and with continuing inquiry into the literacy achievement levels of Canadians, the definition of literacy moved from a [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] one (either a person could, or couldn't write his or her name, or was literate or illiterate), to ones that considered its multidimensionality, along with the qualitative and quantitative aspects of literacy. In the 1970s, organizations like the Canadian Association for Adult Education (CAAE) believed that one had to complete the 8th grade to achieve functional literacy.  Examination of 1976 census data, for example, found that 4,376,655, or 28.4% of Canadians 15 years of age and over reported a level of schooling of less than grade 9 and were thus deemed not functionally literate.<ref name="Thomas"/> But in 1991, UNESCO formally acknowledged Canada's findings that assessment of educational attainment as proxy measure of literacy was not as reliable as was direct assessment.<ref>{{cite web|last=UNESCO|title=Functional Literacy in Eastern and Western Europe|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0009/000906/090661eo.pdf |publisher=UNESCO Institute for Education|accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref> This dissatisfaction manifested itself in the development of actual proficiency tests that measure reading literacy more directly.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite journal|last=OECD, Statistics Canada|title=Literacy for Life: Further Results from the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey|publisher=OECD Publishing}}</ref>

=====Direct systematic measures of literacy in Canada, 1987 to present=====

Canada conducted its first literacy survey in 1987 which discovered that there were more than five million [[Functional illiteracy|functionally illiterate]] adults in Canada, or 24 per cent of the adult population.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> [[Statistics Canada]] then conducted three national and international literacy surveys of the adult population — the first one in 1989 commissioned by the [[Employment and Social Development Canada|Human Resources and Skills Development Canada]] (HRSDC) department.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

This first survey was called the "Literacy Skills Used in Daily Activities" (LSUDA) survey, and was modeled on the 1985 U.S. survey of young adults (YALS).<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite journal|last=OECD, Statistics Canada (2011)|title=Literacy for Life: Further Results from the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey|publisher=OECD Publishing}}</ref>  It represented a first attempt in Canada to produce skill measures deemed comparable across languages. Literacy, for the first time, was measured on a continuum of skills.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>  The survey found that 16% of Canadians had literacy skills too limited to deal with most of the printed material encountered in daily life whereas 22% were considered "narrow" readers.

In 1994-95, Canada participated in the first multi-country, multi-language assessment of adult literacy, the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS). A stratified multi-stage probability sample design was used to select the sample from the Census Frame. The sample was designed to yield separate samples for the two Canadian official languages, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], and participants were measured on the dimensions of prose literacy, document literacy and quantitative literacy.  The survey found that 42.2%, 43% and 42.2% of Canadians between the ages of 16 and 65 scored at the lowest two levels of Prose Literacy, Document Literacy and Quantitative Literacy, respectively.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>  The survey presented many important correlations, among which was a strong plausible link between literacy and a country's economic potential.

In 2003, Canada participated in the Adult Literacy and Life Skills Survey (ALL). This survey contained identical measures for assessing the prose and document literacy proficiencies, allowing for comparisons between survey results on these two measures and found that 41.9% and 42.6% of Canadians between the ages of 16 and 65 scored at the lowest two levels of Prose Literacy and document literacy respectively.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> Further, Canadians’ mean scores also improved on both the prose and the document literacy scales. Energy production:36%, transportation: 24%, homes and businesses: 12%, industry: 11%, agriculture: 10%, and waste: 7%.

The [[OECD]]'s [[Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies]] (PIAAC) is expected to produce new comparative skill profiles in late 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=4406&lang=en&db=imdb&adm=8&dis=2 |title=Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) |publisher=3.statcan.gc.ca |date=12 July 2012 |accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref>

====Mexico====
In the last 40 years, the rate of illiteracy in [[Mexico]] has been steadily decreasing.  In the 1960s, because the majority of the residents of the federal capital were illiterate, the planners of the [[Mexico City Metro]] designed a system of unique icons to identify each station in the system in addition to its formal name. However, the INEGI's census data of 1970 showed a national average illiteracy rate of 25.8%; the last census data puts the national average at 6.9%. Mexico still has a gender educational bias. The illiteracy rate for women in the last census was 8.1% compared with 5.6% for men. Rates differ across regions and states. [[Chiapas]], [[Guerrero]] and [[Oaxaca]], the states with the highest [[Poverty|poverty rate]], had greater than 15% illiteracy in 2010 (17.8%, 16.7% and 16.3 respectively). In contrast, the illiteracy rates in the Federal District (D.F. / Mexico City) and in some northern states like [[Nuevo León]], [[Baja California]], and [[Coahuila]] were below 3% in the 2010 census (2.1%, 2.2%, 2.6% and 2.6% respectively).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/poblacion/analfabeta.aspx?tema=P|title=Analfabetismo.

===== Cultural and westernized literacy for Native Americans in the United States =====

[[File:Carlisle pupils.jpg|upright=1.7|right|thumb|Native youth in front of [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in Pennsylvania c.&nbsp;1900]]

Before colonization, oral storytelling and communication composed most if not all [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] literacy. Native people communicated and retained their histories verbally—it was not until the beginning of [[American Indian boarding schools]] that reading and writing forms of literacy were forced onto Native Americans. While literacy rates of English increased, [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|forced assimilation]] exposed Native children to [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]], unsanitary living conditions, and even death.{{clarify|date=December 2014}} Many students ran away in an attempt to hold on to their [[cultural identity]] and literary traditions that were relevant to their community. While these formalized forms of literacy prepared Native youth to exist in the changing society, they destroyed all traces of their cultural literacy. Native children would return to their families unable to communicate with them due to the loss of their [[indigenous language]]. In the 20th and 21st century, there is still a struggle to learn and maintain cultural language. But education initiatives and programs have increased overall—according to the 2010 census, 86 percent of the overall population of Native Americans and Alaska Natives have high school diplomas, and 28 percent have a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher.<ref>{{cite web| title= American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month: November 2011 |publisher = [[United States Census Bureau]] | url= https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/cb11-ff22.html}}</ref>

This project was developed to increase agriculture production, develop key skills, resolve conflict, improve literacy, and numeracy skills. The LCRP worked within refugee camps near the border of Sierra Leone, however this project only lasted from 1999 to 2001. There are several other international projects working within the country that have similar goals.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|last1=McCaffery|first1=Juliet|title=Using transformative models of adult literacy in conflict resolution and peacebuilding processes at community level: examples from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Sudan.|journal=Compare: A Journal of Comparative Education|date=Dec 2005|volume=35|issue=4|doi=10.1080/03057920500368548|pages=443–462|s2cid=144494846}}</ref>

====Kenya====
The literacy rate in [[Kenya]] among people below 20 years of age is over 70%, as the first 8 years of primary school are provided tuition-free by the government. In January 2008, the government began offering a restricted program of free secondary education. Literacy is much higher among the young than the old population, with the total being about 53% for the country. Most of this literacy, however, is elementary—not secondary or advanced.

====Mali====
{{main|Education in Mali}}
[[Mali]] has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world, at 33.4%, with males having a 43.1% literacy rate and females having a 24.6% literacy rate. In 2015, the adult literacy rate was 33%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://datatopics.worldbank.org/education/country/mali|title=Education Statistics|website=datatopics.worldbank.org|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> The government defines literacy as anyone who is at least 15 and over who can read or write.<ref name="Cwfbl" /> The government of Mali and international organizations in recent years has taken steps to improve the literacy rate. The government recognized the slow progress in literacy rates and began created ministries for basic education and literacy for their national languages in 2007. To also improve literacy the government planned to increase its education budget by 3%, when this was purposed it was at 35% in 2007. The lack of literate adults causes the programs to be slowed. The programs need qualified female trainers, which is a major problem because most men refuse to send female family members to be trained under male teachers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mali: Still a long way to go to meet adult literacy targets|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/77803/mali-still-a-long-way-to-go-to-meet--liteadultracy-targets|accessdate=3 October 2014|work=IRIN|date=17 April 2008|ref=IRIN}}</ref>

====Mauritius====
Free education in [[Mauritius]] didn't proceed beyond the primary level until 1976, so many women now in their 50s or older left school at age 12. The younger generation (below 50) are however extremely well educated with very high educational expectations placed upon pupils. Education is today free from pre-primary to tertiary (only admission fees remain at University level). Most professional people have at least a bachelor's degree. Mauritian students consistently rank top in the world each year for the Cambridge International [[GCE Ordinary Level|O Level]], International A and AS level examinations. Most Mauritian children, even at primary level, attend tuition after school and at weekends to cope with the highly competitive public school system where admission to prestigious public colleges (secondary) and most sought after university courses depend on merit based academic performance.

The adult [[literacy rate]] was estimated at 89.8% in 2011.<ref name="census 2011"/> Male literacy was 92.3% and Female literacy 87.3%.<ref name="census 2011">{{cite journal|url=http://www.govmu.org/portal/goc/cso/ei977/pop2011.pdf|publisher=[[Statistics Mauritius]], [[Government Portal of Mauritius]]|title=2011 POPULATION CENSUS&nbsp;— MAIN RESULTS|year=2011|accessdate=22 January 2015|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223170840/http://www.govmu.org/portal/goc/cso/ei977/pop2011.pdf|archive-date=23 December 2014}}</ref>

====Niger====
[[Niger]] has an extremely low literacy rate at 28.7%. However, the gender gap between males and females is a major problem for the country, men have a literacy rate of 42.9% and women a literacy rate of 15.1%. The [[Government of Niger|Nigerien government]] defines literacy as anyone who can read or write over the age of 15.<ref name="Cwfbl" /> The Niass Tijaniyya, a predominant group of the [[Sufism|Sufi brotherhoods]], has started anti-poverty, empowerment, and literacy campaigns. The women in [[Kiota]] had not attempted to improve their education, or economic standing. Saida Oumul Khadiri Niass, known as Maman, through talking to men and women throughout the community changed the community's beliefs on appropriate behavior for women because the community recognized she was married to a leader of the Niass Tijaniyya. Maman's efforts has allowed women in Kiota to own small businesses, sell in the market place, attend literacy classes, and organize small associations that can give micro loans. Maman personally teaches children in and around Kiota, with special attention to girls. Maman has her students require instructor permission to allow the girls' parents to marry their daughters early. This increases the amount of education these girls receive, as well as delaying [[marriage]], [[pregnancy]], and having [[children]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barnes|first1=Shailly|title=RELIGION SOCIAL CAPITAL AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SAHEL: THE NIASS TIJANIYYA IN NIGER|journal=Journal of International Affairs|date=2009|volume=62|issue=2|pages=209–221|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=1beab10b-5f42-4908-b98f-d353e358de2b%40sessionmgr4005&hid=4105&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&AN=39764466|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>

====Senegal====
[[Senegal]] has a literacy rate of 49.7%; the government defines literacy as anyone who is at least 15 years of age and over who can read and write.<ref name="Cwfbl" /> However, many students do not attend school long enough to be considered literate. The government did not begin actively attempting to improve the literacy rate until 1971 when it gave the responsibility to Department for Vocational Training at the Secretariat for Youth and Sports. This department and subsequent following departments had no clear policy on literacy until the Department of Literacy and Basic Education was formed in 1986. The government of Senegal relies heavily on funding from the [[World Bank]] to fund its school system.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nordtveit|first1=Bjorn|title=Producing Literacy and Civil Society: The Case of Senegal.|journal=Comparative Education Review|date=May 2008|volume=52|issue=2|doi=10.1086/528761|pages=175–198|url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&context=cie_faculty_pubs|hdl=10722/57348}}</ref>

====Somalia====
There is no reliable data on the nationwide literacy rate in [[Somalia]]. A 2013 FSNAU survey indicates considerable differences per region, with the autonomous northeastern [[Puntland]] region having the highest registered literacy rate at 72%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Family Ties: Remittances and Livelihoods Support in Puntland and Somaliland|url=http://www.fsnau.org/downloads/Remittances-and-Livelihoods-Support-in-Puntland-and-Somaliland.pdf|publisher=FSNAU|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref>

====Sierra Leone====
The [[Sierra Leone]] government defines literacy as anyone over the age of 15 who can read and write in [[English language|English]], [[Mende language|Mende]], [[Temne language|Temne]], or [[Arabic]].

====China====
{{main|Education in the People's Republic of China}}
The [[China|PRC]] conducts standardized testing to assess proficiency in [[Standard Chinese]], known as "putonghua," but it is primarily for foreigners or those needing to demonstrate professional proficiency in the [[Beijing]] dialect. Literacy in languages like Chinese can be assessed by reading comprehension tests, just as in other languages, but historically has often been graded on the number of Chinese characters introduced during the speaker's schooling, with a few thousand considered the minimum for practical literacy. Social science surveys in China have repeatedly found that just more than half the population of China is conversant in spoken putonghua.<ref>{{cite news |title=More than half of Chinese can speak mandarin |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |newspaper=China View |date=7 March 2007 |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838.htm}} {{cite news |title=Beijing says 400 million Chinese cannot speak Mandarin |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |newspaper=BBC News |date=6 September 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-23975037}}</ref>

{{main|Literacy in India}}

Literacy is defined by the [[Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India]], as "[the ability of] a person aged 7 years and above [to]... both write and read with understanding in any language."<ref name="India 2011">2011 Census of India: Chapter 6: "State of Literacy of Rural Urban Population". Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, Office of the Registrar and Census Commissioner, India, 2011.</ref> According to the [[Census of India, 2011|2011 census]], 74.04 percent.<ref name="India 2011" />

====Laos====
[[File:Lao schoolgirls reading books.jpg|thumb|right|Three [[Lao people|Laotian]] girls sit outside their school, each absorbed in reading a book they received at a rural school book party.]]

[[Laos]] has the lowest level of adult literacy in all of [[Southeast Asia]] other than [[East Timor]].<ref>[http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/6.html hdrstats.undp.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513165357/http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/6.html |date=13 May 2011 }}, accessed 27 June 2011</ref>

Obstacles to literacy vary by country and culture as writing systems, quality of education, availability of written material, competition from other sources (television, video games, cell phones, and family work obligations), and culture all influence literacy levels. In Laos, which has a [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic]] alphabet, reading is relatively easy to learn—especially compared to [[English language|English]], where spelling and pronunciation rules are filled with exceptions, and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], with thousands of symbols to be memorized. But a lack of books and other written materials has hindered functional literacy in Laos, where many children and adults read so haltingly that the skill is hardly beneficial.

A literacy project in Laos addresses this by using what it calls "books that make literacy fun!" The project, [[Big Brother Mouse]], publishes colorful, easy-to-read books, then delivers them by holding book parties at rural schools. Some of the books are modeled on successful western books by authors such as [[Dr. Seuss]]; the most popular, however, are traditional Lao fairy tales. Two popular collections of folktales were written by Siphone Vouthisakdee, who comes from a village where only five children finished primary school.<ref name="tibor">{{cite news|last=Krausz|first=Tibor|title=Publishing Children's Books – And Delivering Them by Elephant| url= http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Making-a-difference/2011/0221/Publishing-children-s-books-and-delivering-them-by-elephant| accessdate=25 December 2013|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=21 February 2011}}</ref>

Big Brother Mouse has also created village reading rooms, and published books for adult readers about subjects such as Buddhism, health, and baby care.<ref>Wells, Bonnie. "Picturing Laos". Amherst Bulletin, 27 August 2010</ref>

====Pakistan====
In [[Pakistan]], the [[National Commission for Human Development]] (NCHD) aims to bring literacy to adults, especially women.
ISLAMABAD - UNESCO Islamabad Director Kozue Kay Nagata has said, "Illiteracy in Pakistan has fallen over two decades, thanks to the government and people of Pakistan for their efforts working toward meeting the [[Millennium Development Goals]]". "Today, 70 percent of Pakistani youths can read and write. In 20 years, illiterate population has been reduced significantly", she said while speaking at a function held in connection with [[International Literacy Day]].

However, she also emphasised on the need to do more to improve literacy in the country and said, "The proportion of population in Pakistan lacking basic reading and writing is too high. This is a serious obstacle for individual fulfillment, to the development of societies, and to mutual understanding between peoples." Referring to the recent national survey carried out by the Ministry of Education, Trainings and Standards in Higher Education with support of UNESCO, [[UNICEF]], and provincial and areas departments of education, Nagata pointed out that, in Pakistan, although primary school survival rate is 70 percent, gender gap still exists with only 68 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to 71 percent for boys. Specifically in the case of Punjab, she said, primary school survival rate today is better with 76 percent, but not without a gender gap of 8 percent points with 72 percent girls’ survival rate compared to 80 percent for boys. She also pointed out that average per student spending in primary level (age 5-9) was better in Punjab: Rs 6,998, compared to the national average. In [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], although almost the same amount (Rs 6,985) as in Punjab is spent per child, the primary school survival rate is only 53 percent. Girls’ survival rate is slightly better with 54 percent than that of boys which is 52 percent. Literate Pakistan Foundation, a non-profit organization, which was established in 2003, is a case study, which brings to light the solutions for removing this menace from its roots. It works to improve rate of literacy in Pakistan.

The data of the survey shows that in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], primary school survival rate is 67 percent which is lower than the national average of 70 percent. Furthermore, gender gap also exists with only 65 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to that of boys which is 68 percent. Per-student education expenditure in primary level (age 5-9) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is Rs 8,638. In [[Sindh]], primary school survival rate is 63percent, with a gender gap of only 67 percent of girls’ survival rate compared to 60 percent for boys. Per student education expenditure in primary level (age 5-9) in Sindh is Rs 5,019. Nagata made reference to the survey report and mentioned that the most common reason in Pakistan for children (both boys and girls) of age 10 to 18 years leaving school before completing primary grade is "the child not willing to go to school", which may be related to quality and learning outcome. She said, however, and sadly, for the girls living in rural communities the second highest reason for dropout is "parents did not allow" which might be related to prejudice and cultural norm against girls.

Early Filipinos devised and used their own system of writings from 300 BC, which derived from the [[Brahmic family of scripts]] of [[History of India|Ancient India]]. [[Baybayin]] became the most widespread of these derived scripts by the 11th century.

Early chroniclers, who came during the first Spanish expeditions to the islands, noted the proficiency of some of the natives, especially the chieftain and local kings, in [[Sanskrit]], [[Old Javanese]], [[Old Malay]], and several other languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/lci/lci.htm |title=The Laguna Copperplate Inscription |publisher=A Philippine Leaf |last=Santos |first=Hector |date=26 October 1996 |accessdate=23 June 2014 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121194304/http://bibingka.com/dahon/lci/lci.htm |archive-date=21 November 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bergreen|first=Laurence|title=Over The Edge of The World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe|url=https://archive.org/details/overedgeofworl00berg|url-access=registration|location=New York|date=2003}}</ref> During the Spanish colonization of the islands, reading materials were destroyed to a far much less extent compared to the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Education and literacy was introduced only to the [[Peninsulars|Peninsulares]] and remained a privilege until the Americans came. The Americans introduced the public schools system to the country which drove literacy rates up. English became the [[lingua franca]] in the Philippines. It was only during a brief period in the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] that the Japanese were able to teach their [[Japanese language|language]] in the Philippines and teach the children their written language.

After [[World War&nbsp;II]], the Philippines had the highest literacy rates in Asia. It nearly achieved universal literacy once again in the 1980s and 1990s. Ever since then, the literacy rate has plummeted only to start regaining a few percentage years back.{{when|date=March 2017}} The [[Department of Education (Philippines)|DepEd]], [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|CHED]], and other academic institutions encourage children to improve literacy skills and knowledge. The government has a program of literacy teaching starting in kindergarten. New reforms are being brought in shifting to a K-12 system which will teach children their regional languages before English, as opposed to the ten-year basic education program which teaches English and Filipino, the country's two official languages, from Grade 1.
