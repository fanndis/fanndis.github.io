The lyrics of "Both of Us" talks about [[racism]] and [[bullying]]. It was Swift who came up with the idea for the collaboration after she visited B.o.B's label, [[Grand Hustle Records]]. The rapper explained, "She came to [[Atlanta]] and she hit up [[Grand Hustle]]. I wasn't there. [[T.I.|Tip]] was there and I eventually linked with her in Dallas and the rest is history." This is not the first time Swift contributed to a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] song; her other collaborations include a song with [[T-Pain]] at the 2009 [[CMT Music Awards]], and inviting [[T.I.]], [[Nicki Minaj]], and [[Flo Rida]] to her [[Speak Now World Tour]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=25865 |title=Both of Us by B.o.B Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |date=April 11, 2012 |accessdate=August 1, 2012}}</ref>

==Music video==
The [[music video]], directed by [[Jake Nava]], was released on June 27, 2012. B.o.B announced the video on [[Twitter]], sharing a photo and a release date time frame: "On the set of the #BothOfUs music video in [[Nashville]] with @taylorswift13. Video premieres end of June!".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/MTV/status/217967637664235520 |title=Twitter / MTV: MUSIC VIDEO PREMIERE @bob...  |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=June 7, 2012}}</ref>

===Synopsis===
The video begins with B.o.B standing before a small American flag then cuts to Swift singing the song's hook in a dark lit pool hall. B.o.B then takes to the train tracks and streets to deliver his verses while Swift croons the hook in a picturesque field while donning a white cotton dress, and shows a dog that leaves Swift awestruck with his high flying antics. Footage of the artists is interspliced with scenes of life in Nashville's less glamorous neighborhoods like tatted locals, cowboy-boot-wearing young women, shirtless youths playing in sprinklers, teens kissing, a mobile home (this leaves viewers knowing that the video isn't glamorous, but instead leaves viewers appreciating the little things in life â€“ It's not about the money, it's understanding that a romp through a sprinkler or a good game of billiards is enough to take you away from the [[mundane]] moments of everyday life). As the first chorus precedes Swift is shown singing at a field covered with dandelions and flowers and several shots of B.o.B and Swift are interspliced. As the video closes out, viewers are left with a sort of fantasy, with B.o.B and Swift re-imagined as the every man and every woman living simple life in rural [[Tennessee]], much like the folks in the video. At the end, we see B.o.B standing in a driveway with a car backing up and B.o.B staring at it. As of January 2020 the video has over 55 million views on YouTube.

The song sold 143,000 copies in its first week, along with the album release, debuting at number 18 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and became the week's top debut. The single sold over 1,000,000 digital copies as of November 2017.<ref name=us_sales>{{cite web|url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8046939/taylor-swift-career-album-song-sales-ask-billboard| title=Ask Billboard: Taylor Swift's Career Album & Song Sales |date=November 26, 2017 |accessdate = November 26, 2017 |first=Gary |last=Trust}}</ref>
