'''Roderick E. Liddle''' (born 1 April 1960) is an English journalist, and an associate editor of ''[[The Spectator]]''. He was an editor of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme. His published works include, ''Too Beautiful for You'' (2003), ''Love Will Destroy Everything'' (2007), ''The Best of Liddle Britain'' (co-author, 2007) and the semi-autobiographical ''Selfish Whining Monkeys'' (2014). He has presented television programmes, including ''The New Fundamentalists'', ''[[The Trouble with Atheism]]'', and ''Immigration Is A Time Bomb''.

Liddle began his career at the ''[[South Wales Echo]]'', then worked for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and later joined the [[BBC]]. He became editor of ''Today'' in 1998, resigning in 2002 after his employers objected to one of his articles in ''[[The Guardian]]''. He currently writes for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', ''[[The Spectator]]'' and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', among other publications.

His comments have repeatedly caused controversy. In 2004, there was significant media coverage when he left his wife for another woman.<ref name="Smith2004">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/jul/11/pressandpublishing.uknews|title=The bitter fallout from a media divorce|work=The Observer|date=11 July 2004|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref><ref name="Cole">{{cite news|last=Cole|first=Peter|title=Welcome to the Rod, Rachel and Alicia show.

A November 2011 article by Liddle in ''The Spectator'' about the trial of two men involved in the [[murder of Stephen Lawrence]] led to the magazine being prosecuted for breaching reporting restrictions. A court hearing was held in June 2012, in which ''The Spectator'' pleaded guilty to contempt of court and accepted a fine of £5,000 plus costs.<ref name="Bowcott">{{cite news|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/09/spectator-magazine-charge-lawrence-trial|title=Spectator magazine to face charge over article on Stephen Lawrence trial|work=The Guardian|date=9 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title=Spectator to pay out £5,625 over Rod Liddle's Stephen Lawrence article|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/07/spectator-rod-liddle-stephen-lawrence|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=7 June 2012|location=London|date=7 June 2012}}</ref>

==Early life and radio==
Liddle was born in [[Sidcup]], Kent, the son of a train driver. From the age of eight, he was brought up in [[Nunthorpe]], a suburb of [[Middlesbrough]], in north east England. He was educated at the comprehensive [[Laurence Jackson School]] in nearby [[Guisborough]] and the adjacent [[Prior Pursglove College]], where he formed a punk band called ''Dangerbird''. At 16, he was a member of the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]],<ref>Rod Liddle [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jun/05/jubilee.monarchy "Britain's great divide: London versus the rest"], ''The Guardian'', 5 June 2002</ref> remaining a member for about a year,<ref>Rod Liddle [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/17th-december-2005/17/lets-not-forget-the-weirdos-and-halfwits "Let's not forget the weirdos and halfwits"], ''The Spectator'', 16 December 2005.</ref> and was a supporter of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) around the same time.<ref name=Barber>Barber, Lynn. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/05/fiction.features4 "Liddle at large"], ''The Observer'', 5 October 2003</ref>

He attended the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) as a mature student, where he read Social Psychology.<ref name=Timesprofile>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/article455993.ece?token=null&offset=0&page=1 "Profile: Rod Liddle: How to sex up – and mess up – your life"], ''The Times'', 11 July 2004.</ref><ref name=Leapman>Leapman, Michael [http://www.newstatesman.com/node/140860 "The New Statesman Interview – Rod Liddle"], ''New Statesman'', 30 July 2001</ref> His early career in journalism was with the ''[[South Wales Echo]]'' in Cardiff where he was a general news reporter and, for a time, the rock and pop writer. He worked between 1983 and 1987 as a speechwriter and researcher for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/review/4294084.stm "Rod Liddle"], BBC News, 29 September 2005</ref>

Liddle returned to journalism after graduating from the LSE, and was taken on as a trainee producer by the BBC.<ref name=Timesprofile/> Liddle was appointed editor of the ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/question_time/7327168.stm|title=This week's panel|work=BBC News|date=2 April 2008}}</ref> The programme had a strong reputation for its political interviews, but Liddle tried, with some success, to improve the programme's investigative journalism.<ref name=Leapman/> To this end he hired journalists from outside the BBC. Among the most controversial was [[Andrew Gilligan]], who joined from ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' in 1999. Gilligan's 29 May 2003 report on ''Today''—that the British government had "sexed up" the [[WMD dossier|intelligence dossier]] on Iraq, a report broadcast after Liddle had left the programme—began a chain of events that included the death in July that year of [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]], the weapons inspector who was Gilligan's source, and the subsequent [[Hutton Inquiry]], a public inquiry into the circumstances of Kelly's death. Liddle defended Gilligan throughout the controversy.<ref name=Barber/>

Under Liddle's editorship, ''Today'' won a number of awards: a [[Sony Radio Academy Awards|Sony Silver]] in 2002 for reports by Barnie Choudhury and Mike Thomson into the causes of race riots in the north of England; a Sony Bronze in 2003 for an investigation by Angus Stickler into paedophile priests; and an [[Amnesty International]] Media Award in 2003 for Gilligan's investigation into the sale of illegal landmines, an investigation that attracted a lengthy legal action. While working for ''Today'', Liddle also wrote a column for ''[[The Guardian]]''. On 25 September 2002, referring to a march organised by the [[Countryside Alliance]] in defence of [[fox hunting]], Liddle wrote that readers may have forgotten why they voted Labour in 1997, but would remember once they saw the people campaigning to save hunting.<ref>Liddle, Rod. [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/sep/25/broadcasting.ruralaffairs "Marching back to Labour"], ''The Guardian'', 25 September 2002</ref> His column led ''The Daily Telegraph'' to accuse Liddle of bias and of endangering democracy.<ref>Day, Julia. [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/sep/26/pressandpublishing.politicsandthemedia "Telegraph accuses Liddle of political bias"], ''The Guardian'', 26 September 2002.

The BBC concluded that Liddle's comments breached his commitment to impartiality as a BBC programme editor, and gave him an ultimatum to stop writing his column or resign from his position on ''Today''. He resigned on 30 September 2002.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2288751.stm "BBC editor steps down"], BBC News, 30 September 2002.

[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/feb/03/television.uknews "Liddle 'ordered to sack Forsyth'"], ''The Guardian'', 3 February 2003</ref> The BBC replied that the decision was made for editorial reasons.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2720809.stm "BBC rejects Liddle comments"], BBC News, 3 February 2003</ref>

==Television==

===''The New Fundamentalists''===
In ''The New Fundamentalists'', a programme in the ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' strand broadcast in March 2006, Liddle, a member of the [[Church of England]], condemned the rise of [[evangelicalism]] and [[Christian fundamentalism]] in Britain, especially the anti-Darwinian influence of such beliefs in faith schools; and criticised the social teaching and cultural influence of this strand of [[Christianity]]. The documentary was criticised by David Hilborn of the [[Evangelical Alliance]],<ref>[http://www.eauk.org/media/dispatches-response.cfm 'Dispatches: The New Fundamentalists'], Evangelical Alliance, 9 March 2006.</ref> and by Rupert Kaye of the Association of Christian Teachers.<ref>Kaye, Rupert. [http://www.christian-teachers.org.uk/newscomment/10 "The New Fundamentalists"], Association of Christian Teachers, 7 March 2006.</ref>

===''The Trouble with Atheism''===
In ''[[The Trouble with Atheism]]'', Liddle argued that atheists can be as dogmatic and intolerant as the adherents of religion. Liddle said, "History has shown us that it's not religion that's the problem, but any system of thought that insists that one group of people are inviolably in the right, whereas the others are in the wrong and must somehow be punished."<ref>Busfield, Steve. [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/08/pronouncements-rod-liddle "The pronouncements of Rod Liddle"], ''The Guardian'', 8 January 2010.</ref> Liddle argues, for example, that [[eugenics|eugenic]] policies are the logical consequence of dogmatic adherence to [[Darwinism]].

===''Immigration Is a Time Bomb''===
Liddle's ''Immigration Is a Time Bomb'' was broadcast by Channel 4 in 2005. The complaints that followed it included that he should not have allowed [[British National Party]] leader [[Nick Griffin]] to speak unchallenged. [[Ofcom]] adjudicated that the programme was fair, and the complaints were dismissed. Liddle subsequently argued, after Griffin was acquitted in February 2006 of two charges of [[incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|inciting racial hatred]], that the charges were "too ephemeral, too dependent upon the mindset and political disposition of the juror, and upon what is happening outside of the courtroom, on the streets."<ref>Liddle, Rod. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2088-2025181,00.html "Alas, I must defend the BNP"], ''The Times'', 5 February 2006.</ref>

===Other work===
In April 2007, Liddle presented a two-hour-long theological documentary called ''The Bible Revolution'' where he looked back in history to [[William Tyndale]]'s translation of the Bible in English and the effect this had upon the English language.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/can_you_believe_it/debates/revo.html "The Bible Revolution"], Channel 4. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071013161605/http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/can_you_believe_it/debates/revo.html Archived] by the Internet Archive on 13 February 2007.</ref> On 21 May 2007, he presented an hour-long documentary, ''Battle for the Holy Land: Love Thy Neighbour'', about the [[Israeli-Palestinian Conflict]]. He visited [[Bethlehem]], [[Hebron]] and the Israeli settlement of [[Tekoa, Gush Etzion|Tekoa]]. Liddle sought to examine whether [[Israel]] was a true liberal democracy in light of its treatment of the Palestinians. He also appeared in Channel 4's alternative election night episode of ''[[Come Dine With Me]]'' along with [[Edwina Currie]], [[Derek Hatton]] and [[Brian Paddick]].

With [[Kate Silverton]], he presented the short-lived BBC2 political show ''Weekend''—described by ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'' as "The worst programme anywhere, ever, in the history of time",<ref>Stephen Brook [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/08/rod-liddle-outspoken-figure "Rod Liddle: outspoken figure whose views may clash with Indy values"], theguardian.co, 8 January 2010</ref> and [[BBC Four]]'s ''The Talk Show''. He continued to write for ''The Guardian'', and became a team captain on ''[[Call My Bluff (UK game show)|Call My Bluff]]''. He became an associate editor with ''The Spectator''. He also writes for the men's magazines, ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'' and ''[[Arena (magazine)|Arena]]'', and a weekly column for ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]''.<ref name=Timesprofile/>

==Later print journalism==

===Allegations of misogyny and racism===
In August 2009, in his ''Spectator'' blog he wrote about [[Harriet Harman]], deputy leader of the Labour Party, in unflattering terms. Liddle began the article by asking: "So — Harriet Harman, then. Would you? I mean after a few beers obviously, not while you were sober."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Liddle|first1=Rod|title=Harriet Harman is either thick or criminally disingenuous|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/essays/5244693/harriet-harman-is-either-thick-or-criminally-disingenuous.thtml|url-status=dead|accessdate=4 April 2016|work=The Spectator|date=8 August 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204030420/http://www.spectator.co.uk/essays/5244693/harriet-harman-is-either-thick-or-criminally-disingenuous.thtml|archivedate=4 December 2009|via=the Wayback Machine}}</ref> [[Tanya Gold]] asserted in ''The Guardian'' that Liddle had delivered a "tissue-thin polemic." Pointing out that it was ''The Spectator''{{'}}s cover story that week, Gold wondered if, after 100 years of striving to improve women's rights, whether "we're back in the schoolyard – or is it the brothel?"<ref>Tanya Gold [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/08/harriet-harman-rod-liddle-spectator "Swoop, apply lipstick, swoop again"], ''The Guardian'', 8 August 2009</ref> [[Rachel Cooke]] in ''[[The Observer]]'' nearly two months later recalled finding Liddle's piece "so disgusting I flushed violently all the way from my breastbone to my forehead when I first read it. I looked like I had German measles."<ref>Rachel Cooke [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/sep/27/harrietharman "Harriet Harman: 'Nobody believes me, but I am not ambitious'"], ''The Observer'', 27 September 2009</ref>

Liddle asserted two months later that the Harman column "was supposed to be a parody of guttural, base sexism", a joke he assumed readers would understand. After the negative response from Gold (and then Cooke, among other female journalists) he continued: "And then I suppose I came to the conclusion – gradually – that I must have got it wrong."<ref name="Groskop">Viv Groskop [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/article-23751584-rod-liddle-maybe-i-was-wrong-to-say-i-wouldnt-sleep-with-harriet-harman.do "Rod Liddle: Maybe I was wrong to say I wouldn't sleep with Harriet Harman"], ''Evening Standard'' (This is London website), 2 October 2009</ref> In June 2014, he said that of those he had offended, Harman was the one person to whom he would apologise.<ref name="Hattenstone">Simon Hattenstone [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/13/rod-liddle-im-not-a-bigot "Rod Liddle interview: 'I'm not a bigot'"], ''The Guardian'', 13 June 2014</ref>

In November 2009, again for ''The Spectator'' website, he offered "a quick update on what the Muslim savages are up to," a brief article about the stoning to death of a 20-year-old woman in Somalia after she was accused of adultery, and the similar death of a 13-year-old the year before. He made remarks, considered sarcastic, that read: "Incidentally, many Somalis have come to Britain as immigrants recently, where they are widely admired for their strong work ethic, respect for the law and keen, piercing, intelligence."<ref>Hughes, Mark. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/article1835496.ece "Liddle under fire over 'racist' blog"], ''The Independent'', 7 December 2009</ref><ref>Liddle, Rod. [http://www.spectator.co.uk/rodliddle/5552353/muslim-savages-update.thtml "Muslim savages update"], ''The Spectator'', 19 November 2009</ref>

In December 2009, on his ''Spectator'' blog, Liddle referred to two black music producers, Brandon Jolie and Kingsley Ogundele, who had plotted to kill Jolie's 15-year-old pregnant girlfriend, as "human filth" and said the incident was not an anomaly. He continued:
<blockquote>
The overwhelming majority of street crime, knife crime, gun crime, robbery and crimes of sexual violence in London is carried out by young men from the [[British African-Caribbean community|African-Caribbean community]]. Of course, in return, we have rap music, goat curry and a far more vibrant and diverse understanding of cultures which were once alien to us. For which, many thanks.<ref>{{cite news|last=Liddle|first=Rod|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2009/12/benefits-of-a-multicultural-britain/|title=Benefits of a multi-cultural Britain|work=The Spectator|date=5 December 2009|accessdate=15 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202130334/https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2009/12/benefits-of-a-multicultural-britain/|archive-date=2016-12-02}}

When he was accused of racism, Liddle said he was instead engaging in a debate about [[multiculturalism]].<ref>Irvine, Chris. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/6749156/Rod-Liddle-accused-of-racism-for-blog.html "Rod Liddle accused of racism for blog"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 7 December 2009</ref><ref>West, Ed.

In October 2010, Liddle called for the abolition of the [[Welsh language]] TV channel [[S4C]] as a result of the 2010 Comprehensive Spending Review. In his article for The Spectator, he described Welsh nationalists as "miserable, seaweed munching, sheep-bothering pinch-faced hill-tribes".<ref>Liddle, Rod. [http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/rod-liddle/2010/10/sosban-fach-yn-berwi-ana-tan/ "Sosban fach yn berwi ana tan"], ''The Spectator'', 20 October 2010</ref>

In August 2018, Liddle wrote an article in ''The Spectator'' in support of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's controversial comments regarding burkas. The article included the subheading 'My own view is that there is not nearly enough Islamophobia within the Tory party'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/08/why-boris-is-wrong-about-burkas/|title=Why Boris is wrong about burkas|date=11 August 2018|website=The Spectator}}</ref>

===''Independent'' editor rumour and Millwall supporters website===
''The Guardian'' reported on 8 January 2010 that the expected purchase of ''The Independent'' by [[Alexander Lebedev]], a Russian billionaire, would be followed by the appointment of Liddle as editor.<ref>Sweney, Mark and Brook, Stephen. [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jan/08/rod-liddle-edit-independent "Rod Liddle lined up to edit Independent"], ''The Guardian'', 8 January 2010.</ref> [[Roy Greenslade]] wrote on 11 January that the reports were provoking a "major internal and external revolt" by ''The Independent'''s staff and readers.<ref>Greenslade, Roy.

[https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2010/feb/19/rod-liddle-independent "Rod Liddle no longer in running for Independent editor"], ''The Guardian'', 19 February 2010</ref> [[Tim Luckhurst]], Professor of Journalism at the [[University of Kent]], argued that Liddle's prospects of editing ''The Independent'' were nullified "by the people behind a viciously intolerant campaign of liberal bigotry".<ref>Tim Luckhurst [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/19/rod-liddle-independent-editor "How the 'liberal' mob did Rod Liddle in"], ''The Guardian'', 19 February 2012</ref>

In January 2010, the press drew attention to allegedly racist and misogynist comments posted under the username "monkeymfc"—a name Liddle has used—on Millwall Online, a fan club web forum with no official connection to [[Millwall Football Club]]. Liddle at first attributed some of the comments to opposition fans logging in under his name to embarrass him. He later admitted he had written some of the posts that were being criticised, including one in support of the BNP excluding Black and Asian people from the party.<ref>Preston, Peter.

===Stephen Lawrence, Lee Rigby, disabled and transgender people===
In November 2011, an article by Liddle for ''The Spectator'' suggested the trial of two men accused (and later convicted) of murdering [[Murder of Stephen Lawrence|Stephen Lawrence]] would not be fair.<ref>Dominic Ponsford [http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/the-rod-liddle-article-which-threatened-stephen-lawrence-trial-as-it-had-barely-begun-51305/ "The Rod Liddle article which threatened Stephen Lawrence trial as it had barely begun"], ''Press Gazette'' (blog), 4 January 2012</ref> It was referred to the Attorney General ([[Dominic Grieve]]) by the judge for possible contempt of court,<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15778337 "Spectator referred for 'contempt'"], BBC News, 17 November 2011</ref> and he ordered the jurors not to read it. Having decided that it might have breached a court order, Grieve passed the case on to the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] and the Director of Public Prosecutions.<ref>Jason Deans [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/nov/29/spectator-stephen-lawrence-trial "Spectator article on Stephen Lawrence trial referred to DPP"], ''The Guardian'', 29 November 2011</ref> The decision that ''The Spectator'' was to be prosecuted by the CPS for breaching reporting restrictions was announced on 9 May 2012, with a court hearing scheduled for 7 June, although Liddle as the author was not himself liable for prosecution.<ref name="Bowcott"/> [[Fraser Nelson]], the magazine's editor, announced that the prosecution would not be contested,<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18005905 "Spectator charged over Stephen Lawrence article"], BBC News, 9 May 2012</ref> and the magazine pleaded guilty at the hearing.

In January 2012, Liddle wrote that many people in the UK were "pretending to be disabled" in his column for ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'',<ref>'Monkey' [https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2012/jan/26/rod-liddle-sun-column-disabled?newsfeed=true "A Liddle more controversy as Rod's Sun column angers the disabled"], ''The Guardian'' (Media Monkey blog), 26 January 2012</ref> an opinion defended by [[James Delingpole]] who thought "Rod's point is well made".<ref>James Delingpole [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100132880/the-fake-disabled-are-crippling-our-economy/ "The fake disabled are crippling our economy"], ''Telegraph'' (blog), 26 January 2012</ref> Frances Ryan in ''The Guardian'' accused him of "belittling something that on a daily basis affects real people" who can be "a huge benefit to society. Maybe for a month Liddle would like to try that."<ref>Frances Ryan [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/30/rod-liddle-attack-disability "Rod Liddle's attack on disability cannot be ignored"], theguardian.com (blog), 30 January 2012</ref>

On 23 May 2013, Liddle wrote about the murder of soldier [[Murder of Lee Rigby|Lee Rigby]] near the [[Royal Artillery Barracks]] in Woolwich, London. In the original version of a blog article for ''The Spectator'', he referred to the perpetrators as "two black savages".<ref name="LiddleSavage">The revised version refers to "two savages".

In May 2015, the [[Independent Press Standards Organisation]] (IPSO) upheld a complaint from [[Trans Media Watch]] that Liddle had been discriminatory towards [[Emily Brothers]], a blind and [[transgender]] Labour candidate at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], in two ''Sun'' columns published in December 2014 and January 2015.

===BBC coverage of the death of Nelson Mandela===
In December 2013 in a blog article for ''[[The Spectator]]'' website published shortly after [[Nelson Mandela]] died, Liddle wrote of BBC coverage: <blockquote>But for Christ's sake BBC, give it a bloody break for five minutes, will you? It's as if the poor bugger now has to bear your entire self-flagellating white post-colonial bien pensant guilt; look! Famous nice black man dies! Let's re-run the entire history of South Africa. That's better than watching the country we're in being flattened by a storm.<ref name="Liddle051213">Rod Liddle [http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/rod-liddle/2013/12/nelson-mandela-dies-aged-95-the-bbc-goes-into-overdrive/ "Nelson Mandela dies, aged 95"], ''The Spectator'' (blog), 5 December 2013</ref></blockquote> He also wrote:<blockquote>Look; I'm sorry Nelson Mandela is dead. It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness for many of us. I never met the man but, on balance, I came to the conclusion that he was a force for good rather than ill. I think I came to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion twenty years ago, or maybe fifteen. So, I'm sorry he's dead, I wish it were otherwise.<ref name="Liddle051213"/><ref name="Plunkett">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/06/rod-liddle-bbc-nelson-mandela-spectator|title=Rod Liddle criticises BBC for too much coverage of Nelson Mandela death|last=Plunkett|first=John|publisher=The Guardian|date=6 December 2013|accessdate=6 December 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

===Column on poppers and gay sex===
During a [[parliamentary debate]] on the Psychoactive Substances Bill – which "makes it an offence to produce, supply, offer to supply, possess with intent to supply, possess on custodial premises, import or export [[psychoactive substances]]"<ref>{{cite news|title=Psychoactive Substances Act 2016|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/psychoactive-substances-bill-2015|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=[[Gov.uk]]|agency=Home Office|date=29 May 2015}}</ref> the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Crispin Blunt]] admitted he used [[poppers]]:

<blockquote>And would be directly affected by this legislation. And I was astonished to find that it's proposed they be banned and, frankly, so were very many gay men.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Perraudin|first1=Frances|title=Tory MP Crispin Blunt: 'I out myself as poppers user'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jan/20/tory-mp-crispin-blunt-poppers-drug-policy|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=The Guardian|date=20 January 2016}}</ref></blockquote>

Liddle responded in his ''Spectator'' blog: <blockquote>So, Crispin Blunt MP feels hurt because laws proscribing {{sic|amyl nitrate}}<!-- Should be "nitrite", not "nitrate". --> (or 'poppers') would criminalise the entire gay community. ... I would have thought that the requirement for amyl nitrate to relax the sphincter muscle and lube to accommodate entry was God's way of telling you that what you're about to do is unnatural and perverse. Or your body's way of telling you – your call. So eeeeuw. ... Crispin and others can always use a [[jemmy]] [crowbar] instead.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Liddle|first1=Rod|title=Did we really have to hear all about Crispin Blunt's sex life?|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/01/did-we-really-have-to-hear-all-about-crispin-blunts-sex-life/|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=The Spectator|date=25 January 2016}}</ref></blockquote>

The [[satire|satirical]] and [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] [[Humor magazine|magazine]] ''[[Private Eye]]'' described this as hypocritical, pointing out Liddle's account in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' of using [[Viagra]] in July 2004 in which he wrote that it was: "The weirdest drug I ever took, far more psychologically disturbing than LSD. For the next six hours, I had this implacable, disembodied, unconscionably rigid appendage dragging me hither and thither".<ref>{{cite news|title=Private Eye|url=http://pbs.twimg.com/media/CaS4nkpWwAAL-4Y.jpg|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=[[Private Eye]]|issue=1411|date=5 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Liddle|first=Rod|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/article2398297.ece|title=Love rat?

A spokesperson from the [[LGBT rights]] charity ''[[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]]'' said of Liddle's remarks: "Comments like this are shocking and damaging, but we wouldn't expect anything less from repeat offending bigots like Rod Liddle. The Government's move for an immediate review of whether poppers are harmful is right, but banning them ... will cause confusion and drive gay and bi men who use poppers to seek out illegal drug suppliers from April onwards, putting their health at serious risk."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ridley|first1=Louise|title=Rod Liddle Slammed As 'Repeat Offending Bigot' For Column On Poppers And Gay Sex|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/01/25/rod-liddle-spectator-poppers_n_9071604.html|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=25 January 2016}}</ref>

===Unfair treatment by ''Newsnight''===
Liddle appeared on the BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' to discuss [[Brexit]] on 15 July 2019, debating anti-Brexit activist [[Tom Baldwin (journalist)|Tom Baldwin]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM4HN7TeDvA Brexit: Rod Liddle and People's Vote's Tom Baldwin on 'betrayal' - BBC Newsnight - YouTube]</ref> A complainant alleged that BBC host [[Emily  Maitlis]] had been "sneering and bullying" towards Liddle, accusing him of writing columns of containing "consistent casual racism week after week" and asking Liddle if he would describe himself as a racist. An investigation by the BBC Executive Complaints Unit upheld the complaints against Maitlis, agreeing that she had been "persistent and personal" in her criticism of Liddle thus "leaving her open to the charge that she had failed to be even-handed" in the discussion. The successful complainant suggested that the broadcast exemplified the way the BBC views Leave voters; [[Douglas Murray (author)|Douglas Murray]] described the segment as "more of a drive-by shooting than an interview".<ref>[https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/bbc-upholds-complaint-against-emily-maitlis-over-sneering-newsnight-discussion-with-rod-liddle/ BBC upholds complaint against Emily Maitlis over 'sneering' Newsnight discussion with Rod Liddle<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/09/27/whatever-happened-impartial-journalists/ The BBC can no longer claim to be impartial<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/sites/default/files/2020-01/Bulletin%20April%20-%20September%2019.pdf</ref>

===Column on Muslim voters===
In October 2019, Liddle penned a column in ''The Spectator'' commenting on the forthcoming [[2019 United Kingdom general election|December 2019 UK general election]], which suggested that the election should be held on a Muslim holy day to reduce the Labour vote.
The column was criticised by senior political figures including Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Sajid Javid]] and former Conservative [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[David Lidington]].  Liddle defended the content as being humorous.  The article  also criticised the Labour MP [[Rosie Duffield]]'s recent speech about her experience of trying to exit an abusive relationship; Duffield described the article as "racist and misogynistic".<ref>{{cite news|author=Aubrey Allegretti|title=Rod Liddle's Spectator article calling for general election on Muslim holy day 'unacceptable'|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=2 November 2019|work=Sky News|url=https://news.sky.com/story/rod-liddles-spectator-article-on-muslims-voting-attacked-by-sajid-javid-11851238}}</ref>

==Books==

In 2003, Liddle wrote a collection of short stories, ''Too Beautiful For You''.<ref>Jeffreys, Susan. [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/too-beautiful-for-you-by-rod-liddle-582039.html "Too Beautiful For You By Rod Liddle"], ''The Independent'', 3 October 2003.</ref> He said he has always wanted to be a writer, and saw journalism as a cop-out.<ref name=Barber/> He is also the author of ''Love Will Destroy Everything'' (2007) and the co-author of ''The Best of Liddle Britain'' (2007).

''Selfish Whining Monkeys: How we Ended Up Greedy, Narcissistic and Unhappy'', appeared in 2014. Admitting to having paid little attention to Liddle's journalism, [[Will Self]], in his review for ''The Guardian'' wrote: "it's so much more authoritative to hear a man condemned out of his own mouth over 200-plus pages than it is to assay him on the basis of newspaper columns, which, by and large, favour polarised views tendentiously expressed." Despite his serious reservations about Liddle's writing, Self concludes: "The peculiar thing is that I can't find it in my heart of hearts to dislike the man, I think there's good in him and that he can change his bilious complexion."<ref>Will Self [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/22/selfish-whining-monkeys-rod-liddle-review "Selfish, Whining Monkeys by Rod Liddle review – why is he so angry?"], ''The Guardian'', 22 May 2014</ref> Liddle responded to Self's review in an interview with [[Archie Bland]] of ''The Independent'' a few weeks later: "He reviewed what he thought I was, not what the book was about. Bizarre. I think it's slightly deranged."<ref>Archie Bland [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/rod-liddle-gives-his-critics-plenty-of-reasons-to-dislike-him--but-why-does-he-seem-to-loathe-himself-so-much-9533384.html "Rod Liddle gives his critics plenty of reasons to dislike him - but why does he seem to loathe himself so much?"], ''The Independent'', 12 June 2014</ref>

In July 2019 Liddle published ''The Great Betrayal'', a book about [[Brexit]]. The book was reviewed positively by Professor [[Matthew Goodwin]] in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', who called it "a no-holds-barred attack on the Establishment's blocking of Brexit".<ref>{{cite web|author=Review by Matthew Goodwin |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-great-betrayal-by-rod-liddle-review-a-mass-revolt-hx3c95m6x |title=The Great Betrayal by Rod Liddle review — a no-holds-barred attack on the Establishment’s blocking of Brexit &#124; Culture &#124; The Sunday Times |publisher=Thetimes.co.uk |date=2019-07-21 |accessdate=2020-01-12}}</ref> [[Harry Mount]] at ''[[The Spectator]]'' called the book "very engaging", despite noting concerns that the book's claim of a betrayal of Brexit possibly proving to be unfounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/09/rod-liddle-on-brexit-the-great-betrayal-reviewed/ |title=Rod Liddle on Brexit: The Great Betrayal reviewed |publisher=The Spectator |date=2019-09-21 |accessdate=2020-01-12}}</ref> However, [[Fintan O'Toole]] writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' said the book was "as untroubled by facts as by logic".

==Personal life==
Liddle met Rachel Royce, a television presenter, at the BBC in 1993, and the couple soon became romantically involved.<ref name=Burleigh>Burleigh, James.

They had been living in [[Heytesbury]], Wiltshire, and had two sons together, Tyler and Wilder.<ref name="Burleigh"/> Six months later, Liddle moved in with Alicia Monckton, a 22-year-old receptionist at ''The Spectator''. It transpired that he had cut his honeymoon with Royce short so that he could be with Monckton.<ref name="Burleigh"/> Following their divorce, Liddle and Royce exchanged attacks in the media. Liddle called her a "total slut and slattern",<ref>Cassandra Jardine [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3620637/Men-always-want-other-women.html "'Men always want other women'"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 13 July 2004</ref> and Royce wrote an article in the ''Daily Mail'' titled "My cheating husband Rod, 10 bags of manure and me the bunny boiler. As for The Slapper... she's welcome to him".<ref name="Smith2004"/><ref name="Cole"/>

On 5 May 2005, he was arrested for common assault against Monckton, who was 20 weeks pregnant at the time. He admitted the offence and accepted a [[police caution]], but asserted later that he did so only because it was the quickest way for him to be released, and that he had not assaulted her.<ref>Bloomfield, Steve.
