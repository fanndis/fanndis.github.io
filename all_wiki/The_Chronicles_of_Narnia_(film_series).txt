'''''The Chronicles of Narnia''''' series of films is based on ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', a series of novels by [[C. S. Lewis]]. From the seven books, three were adapted—''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' (2005), ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian|Prince Caspian]]'' (2008), and ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader|The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'' (2010)—which collectively grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide. 

The series revolves around the adventures of children in the world  of [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]], guided by [[Aslan]], a wise and powerful lion that can speak and is the true king of Narnia. The children heavily featured in the films are the Pevensie siblings, and a prominent antagonist is the [[White Witch]] (also known as Queen Jadis).

The first two films were directed by [[Andrew Adamson]] and the third film was directed by [[Michael Apted]]. A fourth film was to be directed by [[Joe Johnston]], but it was announced in 2018 that new adaptations of the series would be made for [[Netflix]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-develop-series-and-films-based-on-c-s-lewis-beloved-the-chronicles-of-narnia|title=Netflix to develop series and films based on C.S. Lewis' beloved THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA|website=Netflix Media Center|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>

==Development==
C. S. Lewis never sold the film rights to the ''Narnia'' series during his lifetime, as he was skeptical that any cinematic adaptation could render the more fantastical elements and characters of the story realistically.{{Efn |A general dislike of cinema is seen in ''Collected Letters'', Vol. 2, a letter to his brother Warren on March 3, 1940, p. 361; see also ''All My Road Before Me'', June 1, 1926, p. 405}}  Only after seeing a demo reel of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animals did [[Douglas Gresham]] (Lewis's stepson and [[literary executor]], and film co-producer) give approval for a film adaptation.

Although the plan was originally to produce the films in the same order as the book series' original publication, it was reported that ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', which recounts the creation of Narnia, would be the fourth feature film in the series, instead of ''[[The Silver Chair]]''. It was rumoured that ''The Magician's Nephew'' was chosen as an attempt to reboot the series, after the release of ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' grossed less when compared to the two previous films.<ref name= "Christianity Today">{{cite web  |url= http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/movies/interviews/2011/lionwitchboxoffice.html |title= The Lion, the Witch, and the Box Office | work = Christianity Today |last=Moring |first=Mark |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=May 1, 2011}}</ref> In March 2011, Walden Media confirmed that they intended ''The Magician's Nephew'' to be next in the series, but stressed that it was not yet in development.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/03/23/magicians-nephew-new-narnia-film/ | date = 23 Oct 2011 | work = Inside movies |title= 'Narnia': Walden, Fox in discussions on 'The Magician's Nephew' |publisher= EW}}</ref>

In October 2011, Douglas Gresham stated that Walden Media's contract with the C. S. Lewis estate had expired, hinting that Walden Media's lapse in renegotiating their contract with the C. S. Lewis estate was due to internal conflicts between both companies about the direction of future films.<ref name=future>{{cite web|url= http://www.narniaweb.com/2012/05/gresham-shares-plans-for-next-narnia-film/ | date = May 2012 |title= Gresham Shares Plans for Next Narnia Film |publisher= Narnia Web}}</ref>

On 1 October 2013, The C. S. Lewis Company announced a partnership with [[The Mark Gordon Company]], and that ''The Chronicles of Narnia: The Silver Chair'' was officially in pre-production.<ref name= 'The Silver Chair'>{{cite web|url= https://www.deadline.com/2013/10/chronicles-of-narnia-silver-chair-movie-mark-gordon/ |title= Fourth "Chronicles of Narnia" Movie in Works from Mark Gordon Co | date = Oct 2013 |work= Deadline}}</ref>

==Films==

{{Main|The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe}}
[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'']], based on the 1950 [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|novel of the same title]], is the first film in the series. Directed by Andrew Adamson, it was shot mainly in New Zealand, though locations were used in Poland, the [[Czech Republic]] and the United Kingdom.

The story follows the four British [[Pevensie]] siblings, who are evacuated during [[the Blitz]] to the countryside, where they find a wardrobe that leads to the [[fantasy world]] of [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]]. There, they must ally with the lion [[Aslan]] against the forces of the [[White Witch]], who has placed Narnia in an eternal winter.

The film was released theatrically on 9 December 2005 and on DVD on 4 April 2006 and grossed over $745 million worldwide.

The story follows the same Pevensie children who were transported to Narnia in the [[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|previous film]] as they return to Narnia, where 1,300 years have passed and the land has been invaded by the [[Telmarines]].

In February 2009 it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] would replace Disney for future installments. Directed by Michael Apted, the movie was filmed almost entirely in [[Australia]].

The story follows the two younger Pevensie children as they return to Narnia with their cousin, [[Eustace Scrubb]].

==Future==

=== ''The Silver Chair'' ===
After Walden Media's contract of the series' film rights expired in 2011, The C. S. Lewis Company announced on 1 October 2013 that it had entered into an agreement with The Mark Gordon Company to produce an adaptation of the 1953 novel ''[[The Silver Chair]]''. [[Mark Gordon]] and [[Douglas Gresham]], along with Vincent Sieber, the [[Los Angeles]] based director of The C. S.
