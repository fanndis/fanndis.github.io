Born in [[Midland, Texas]], Bush graduated from [[Southern Methodist University]] in 1968 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[education]], and took a job as a [[second grade]] teacher. After attaining her [[master's degree]] in [[library science]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], she was employed as a librarian.

Bush met her future husband, George W. Bush, in 1977, and they were married later that year. The couple had twin daughters in 1981. Bush's political involvement began during her marriage. She campaigned with her husband during his unsuccessful 1978 run for the [[United States Congress]], and later for his successful [[Governor of Texas|Texas gubernatorial]] campaign.

As First Lady of Texas, Bush implemented many initiatives focused on health, education, and [[literacy]].<ref name=flt/> In 1999–2000, she aided her husband in campaigning for the presidency in a number of ways, such as delivering a keynote address at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]], which gained her national attention. She became First Lady after her husband was [[First inauguration of George W. Bush|inaugurated as president]] on January 20, 2001.

Polled by [[The Gallup Organization]] as one of the most popular First Ladies, Bush was involved in national and global concerns during her tenure.<ref name=gallup/> She continued to advance her trademark interests of education and literacy by establishing the annual [[National Book Festival]] in 2001, and encouraged education on a worldwide scale. She also advanced women's causes through [[The Heart Truth]] and [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]] organizations. She represented the United States during her foreign trips, which tended to focus on HIV/AIDS and [[malaria]] awareness.

The Bushes had tried to conceive for three years, but pregnancy did not happen easily.

===Education and children===
Early into the administration, Bush made it known that she would focus much of her attention on education. This included recruiting highly qualified teachers to ensure that young children would be taught well.<ref name=teach>{{cite news |url=http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2001/02/wh-0226.html |title=First Lady Laura Bush Launches Education Initiatives |accessdate=May 26, 2008 |publisher=U.S. Department of Education |date=February 26, 2001 |archivedate=October 6, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006080554/http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2001/02/wh-0226.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> She also focused on early child development.<ref name=teach/> In 2001, to promote reading and education, she partnered with the [[Library of Congress]] to launch the annual [[National Book Festival]]. In January 2002, Bush testified before the Senate Committee on Education, asking for higher teachers' salaries and better training for [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] programs. She is also credited with creating a national initiative called "Ready to Read, Ready to Learn", which promotes reading at a young age. To promote American patriotic heritage in schools, she helped launch the [[National Anthem Project]]. In 2006, Bush and media executives worked together to provide a $500,000 grant for school libraries along the Gulf Coast which had been devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.<ref name="Bush Biography"/>

Immediately following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Bush spoke regarding America's children:

<blockquote>[W]e need to reassure our children that they are safe in their homes and schools. We need to reassure them that many people love them and care for them, and that while there are some bad people in the world, there are many more good people.<ref>{{cite news |date=November 8, 2001 |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/11/20011108-7.html |title=Mrs. Laura Bush Speaks at the National Press Club |accessdate=May 25, 2008 |publisher=The White House |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514161913/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/11/20011108-7.html |url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>

Later in her tenure, she was honored by the United Nations, as the body named her honorary ambassador for the United Nations' Decade of Literacy.

On October 3, 2008, she visited Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Home and Museum where she praised her works such as ''[[Farmer Boy]]'', ''[[These Happy Golden Years]]'' and ''[[Little House on the Prairie]]'', the last of which she had felt an association with as a child.

===September 11 attacks===
On September 11, 2001, Bush had been hosting her in-laws [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Barbara Bush]] at the White House and was scheduled to give a testimony to Congress on education.<ref>{{cite book|title=George H. W.

Two weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks, Bush inaugurated a music concert at the [[Kennedy Center]], organized to raise funds for families of the victims. Though she received applause, she returned the compliment to members of the audience and added that although the event was tragic, Americans had deepened their appreciation "of life itself, how fragile it can be, what a gift it is and how much we need each other". Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], who introduced Bush at the event, praised her and said he knew his late brother, President [[John F. Kennedy]], would also be proud of her.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/25/us/a-nation-challenged-the-first-lady-mrs-bush-introduces-concert-for-families.html|title=A Nation Challenged: The First Lady; Mrs. Bush Introduces Concert For Families|first=Elisabeth |last=Bumiller |date=September 25, 2001 |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> Bush believes the September 11 attacks ignited the interest in the way Afghan women were treated.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/on-the-record/transcript/former-first-lady-laura-bush-continues-fight-afghan-women039s-rights|title=Former First Lady Laura Bush Continues to Fight for Afghan Women's Rights |publisher=Fox News|date=March 31, 2011}}</ref>

===Women's health and rights===
Another of her signature issues were those relating to the health and well being of women. She established the Women's Health and Wellness Initiative and became involved with two major campaigns.

Yet heart disease kills more women in our country than all forms of cancer combined. When it comes to heart disease, education, prevention, and even a little red dress can save lives."<ref name=ht/> She has undertaken a signature personal element of traveling around the country and talking to women at hospital and community events featuring the experiences of women who live, or had lived, with the condition.<ref name=ht/> This outreach was credited with saving the life of one woman who went to the hospital after experiencing symptoms of a heart attack.<ref name=ht/>

Bush campaigned for Republicans around the country in 2002 for that year's midterm elections, attending and hosting fundraisers as well as giving speeches that were deemed as the Bush administration "working against women's rights issues and using women to do their dirty work" and partly a test for Bush on how well she could campaign for her husband in the impending two years when he sought re-election.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newsweek.com/west-wing-story-laura-bush-and-gender-card-146157|title=West Wing Story: Laura Bush and the Gender Card|first=Martha|last=Brant|magazine= Newsweek|date=October 30, 2002}}</ref>

[[Sady Doyle]] reasoned that Bush was hard to dislike due to her adopting "the least partisan causes" such as literacy and breast cancer, which would attract the support of most Americans and her coming off as a "mild, polite, ordinary woman who might go to church with your mother, or organize suburban potlucks". Doyle furthered that her statements were never enough to offend others and the harshest criticism that could be bestowed upon her was that she was boring.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/05/the-secret-inner-life-of-laura-bush/56644/|title=The Secret Inner Life of Laura Bush|date=May 13, 2010|first=Sady|last=Doyle|magazine=The Atlantic}}</ref>

She disagreed with [[Fox News]]' [[Chris Wallace (journalist)|Chris Wallace]] in 2006 when Wallace asked why the American people were beginning to lose confidence in President Bush, saying, "Well, I don't think they are.

There are a lot of difficult challenges right now in the United States&nbsp;... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are.

===Views on policy===
Bush is a [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] and has identified herself with the GOP since her marriage.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Watson|first1=Robert P.|title=Laura Bush: The Report to the First Lady 2005|date=2005|publisher=Nova Science Publisher |isbn=1594542902|page=166}}</ref>

When asked about abortion in 2000, Bush said she did not believe ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' should be overturned. She did not comment on whether women had the right to an abortion.<ref name=abortion>{{cite news|accessdate=May 28, 2008 |date=January 19, 2001 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/19/laurabush.abortion.02/ |title=Laura Bush's abortion comments 'personal views', Fleischer says |publisher=CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523020028/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/19/laurabush.abortion.02/ |archivedate=May 23, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> She did say, however, that the country should do "what we can to limit the number of abortions, to try to reduce the number of abortions in a lot of ways, and that is, by talking about responsibility with girls and boys, by teaching [[abstinence]], having abstinence classes everywhere in schools and in churches and in [[Sunday school]]".<ref name=abortion/>

Bush responded to a question during a 2006 interview concerning the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] by calling for elected leaders not to politicize [[same-sex marriage]], "I don't think it should be used as a campaign tool, obviously. It requires a lot of sensitivity to just talk about the issue&nbsp;... a lot of sensitivity."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/05/14/politics/p131514D67.DTL&feed=rss.news |title=Mrs. Bush: Don't Campaign on Marriage Ban |last=Pickler |first=Nedra |accessdate=December 13, 2006 |date=May 14, 2006 |agency=Associated Press |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810084948/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2006%2F05%2F14%2Fpolitics%2Fp131514D67.DTL&feed=rss.news |archivedate=August 10, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

On July 12, 2005, while in South Africa, Bush suggested her husband replace retiring [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] with another woman. On October 2, during a private dinner at the White House with his wife, President Bush nominated [[Harriet Miers]] to replace O'Connor.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/03/AR2005100300252.html|title=White House Counsel Miers Chosen for Court|author=Fletcher, Michael|accessdate=December 13, 2006|date=October 4, 2005|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> Later that month, after Miers had faced intense criticism, Laura Bush questioned whether the charges were [[Sexism|sexist]] in nature.<ref>{{cite news|last=VandeHei |first=Jim|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/11/AR2005101100456.html|title=Laura Bush Echoes Sexism Charge in Miers Debate|accessdate=December 13, 2006|date= October 12, 2005|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

=== Legacy ===
In late October 2008, days before that year's presidential election, Bush hosted a three-hour session with staffers and historians discussing how she would like to be remembered, leading to this meeting being termed the "legacy lunch".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/laura-bush-fills-in-the-blanks/|title=Laura Bush Fills In The Blanks|date=May 23, 2009|publisher=CBS News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://parkcitiesblog.dallasnews.com/2009/05/laura-bush-shaping-her-own-leg.html/|title=Laura Bush: Shaping Her Own Legacy|newspaper=Dallas Morning News|date=May 24, 2009}}</ref> According to historian Myra Gutin, this was the first time in history that a First Lady had ever directly reached out to historians to talk about her accomplishments. Attendants of the meeting said that Bush wanted to change the perception that she was a traditional First Lady in that she always stayed by her husband's side.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2009/05/laura-bush-fills-in-the-blanks-022897|title=Laura Bush fills in the blanks|publisher=POLITICO|date=May 23, 2009|first=Nia-Malika|last=Henderson}}</ref> At a 2014 [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]], Anita McBride opined that it would be harder for people to understand where Bush had "the greatest impact" due to the several signature issues that Bush advocated for while First Lady.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/02/12/laura-bushs-legacy-harder-to-define-than-michelle-obamas|title=Legacy: Why Michelle Has a Leg Up on Laura

In 2017, journalist [[Brooke Baldwin]] suggested Bush's efforts toward improving the lives of Afghan women may have contributed to more Afghanistan women being in positions within the [[Afghanistan]] private sector.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/13/politics/brooke-baldwin-laura-bush-rula-ghani-afghanistan-women/index.html|first=Brooke|last=Baldwin|title=Laura Bush and Rula Ghani on 'opening the door' for women in Afghanistan|date=November 13, 2017|publisher=CNN}}</ref>

Bush enjoyed widespread approval by the American public both as the incumbent First Lady and during her retirement.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/29/bush.popularity/|title=Poll: First lady embraced, president not|date=December 30, 2005|publisher=CNN}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' contributor [[Krissah Thompson]] recalled Bush's favorability being "as close to universal popularity as any modern political figure" when the Bushes left the [[White House]] in 2009 and called her "the most high-profile promoter of the George W.

On May 11, 2010, during an interview on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', Bush was asked about [[same-sex marriage]]. She said she viewed it as a generational issue and believed it would be made legal in the future. Bush offered support for the issue by saying "when couples are committed to each other and love each other&nbsp;... they ought to have the same sort of rights that everyone has." Bush referred to her 2000 interview, reaffirming her support for ''Roe v. Wade'', "I think it's important that [abortion] remain legal. Because I think it's important for people – that for medical reasons and, and other reasons."<ref>{{YouTube|HtNabdDx_mU|Laura Bush For Gay Marriage & Pro-Choice!}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/09/27/george-w-bush-silent-on-same-sex-marriage-after-dad-helps-legalize-one |first=Steven|last=Nelson|title=George W.

=== Trump administration ===
In January 2017, Bush attended the [[Inauguration of Donald Trump]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/01/20/510850745/-meme-of-the-week-george-w-bush-battles-poncho-at-inauguration-and-loses|title=#Meme Of The Week: George W.

===Involvement with GOP===
In the later months of 2012, Bush campaigned for Republican presidential nominee [[Mitt Romney]], hosting a fundraiser in September with [[Ann Romney]] and appearing in [[Livonia, Michigan]], the following month for a Romney campaign event.
