Ahead of the 2008 election, Ardern was ranked 20th on Labour's [[Party lists in the 2008 New Zealand general election#Labour Party|party list]].

On 5 November 2017, Ardern made her first official overseas trip to Australia, where she met Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]] for the first time. [[Australia–New Zealand relations|Relations between the two countries]] had been strained in the preceding months because of Australia's treatment of New Zealanders living in the country, and shortly before taking office, Ardern had spoken of the need to rectify this situation, and to develop a better working relationship with the Australian government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/98395425/jacinda-ardern-makes-first-state-visit-to-australia-to-strengthen-ties|title=Jacinda Ardern makes first state visit to Australia to strengthen ties|website=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=11 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112023217/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/98395425/jacinda-ardern-makes-first-state-visit-to-australia-to-strengthen-ties|archive-date=12 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Turnbull described the meeting in cordial terms: "we trust each other...The fact we are from different political traditions is irrelevant".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11940766|title=Key bromance haunts Jacinda Ardern's first Australia visit|last=Trevett|first=Claire|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=11 November 2017|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111091309/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11940766|archive-date=11 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Ardern flew to Vietnam on 9 November for her first visit to an [[APEC Vietnam 2017|APEC summit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/343382/pm-heads-to-talks-hoping-to-win-tpp-concessions|title=PM heads to talks hoping to win TPP concessions|date=9 November 2017|accessdate=10 November 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109132929/http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/343382/pm-heads-to-talks-hoping-to-win-tpp-concessions|archive-date=9 November 2017}}</ref>

In December 2017, Ardern voiced support for [[United Nations General Assembly resolution ES-10/L.22|the UN resolution]] criticising US President [[Donald Trump]]'s decision to recognise [[Jerusalem]] as the [[Status of Jerusalem|capital of Israel]], saying that some decisions "that we saw by international actors like the United States recently ... took us backwards, not forwards."<ref name="radionewzealand"/>

On 20 April 2018, Ardern attended the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2018]] in London, where she was selected to deliver a toast to the Commonwealth at a state banquet of world leaders.

On 5 September, Ardern travelled to [[Nauru]], where she attended the [[Pacific Islands Forum]].

On 2 December 2020, Ardern declared a climate change emergency in New Zealand and pledged that the Government would be carbon neutral by 2025 in a parliamentary motion. As part of this commitment towards carbon neutrality, the public sector will be required to buy only electric or hybrid vehicles, the fleet will be reduced over time by 20% and all 200 coal-fired boilers in public service buildings will be phased out. This motion was supported by the Labour, Green, and Māori parties but was opposed by the opposition National and ACT parties.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Phil |title=New Zealand declares a climate change emergency |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/02/new-zealand-declares-a-climate-change-emergency |access-date=2 December 2020 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2 December 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20201202030445/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/02/new-zealand-declares-a-climate-change-emergency |archive-date=2 December 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Cooke |first1=Henry |title=Government will have to buy electric cars and build green buildings as it declares climate change emergency |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300172852/government-will-have-to-buy-electric-cars-and-build-green-buildings-as-it-declares-climate-change-emergency |access-date=2 December 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=2 December 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20201202053524/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300172852/government-will-have-to-buy-electric-cars-and-build-green-buildings-as-it-declares-climate-change-emergency |archive-date=2 December 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>
