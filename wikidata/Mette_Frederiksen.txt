'''Mette Frederiksen''' ({{IPA-da|ˈmetə ˈfʁeðʁeksn̩}}; born 19 November 1977) is a  Danish politician who has been [[Prime Minister of Denmark]] since June 2019 and [[Social Democrats (Denmark)#Leader of the Social Democrats|Leader of the Social Democrats]] since June 2015. The second woman to hold either office, she is also the youngest Prime Minister in Danish history.<ref name="DW">{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/denmarks-youngest-prime-minister-to-lead-new-government/a-49357121|title=Denmark's youngest prime minister to lead new government|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=25 June 2019|accessdate=27 June 2019}}</ref>

Besides a very brief career as a [[trade union]]ist (2000–2001), Frederiksen has never had any employment outside politics. She was first elected to the [[Folketing]] in the [[2001 Danish general election|2001 general election]], representing [[Copenhagen County]]. After the Social Democrats won the [[2011 Danish general election|2011 general election]], she was appointed [[Thorning-Schmidt I Cabinet|Minister of Employment]] by Prime Minister [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]]. She was later promoted to become [[Minister of Justice of Denmark|Minister of Justice]] in 2014. After the Social Democrats' narrow defeat in the [[2015 Danish general election|2015 general election]], Thorning-Schmidt stood down and Frederiksen won the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)#Leader of the Social Democrats|subsequent leadership election]] to replace her, becoming [[Leader of the Opposition]].<ref name="Folketing">{{ft.dk link}}.

Frederiksen led her party into the [[2019 Danish general election|2019 general election]] which resulted in the bloc of [[left-wing]] and [[centre-left]] parties (her [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]], the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberals]], the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]], the [[Red–Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red–Green Alliance]], the [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] [[Social Democratic Party (Faroe Islands)|Social Democratic Party]] and [[Greenland]]'s [[Siumut]] and [[Inuit Ataqatigiit]]) winning a majority in the Folketing. Frederiksen was subsequently commissioned by [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]] to lead [[Frederiksen Cabinet|ultimately successful negotiations]] to form a new government and was sworn in as Prime Minister on 27 June.

== Early life ==
Born in [[Aalborg]], Frederiksen's father was a [[typographer]] and her mother was a [[teacher]].<ref name="Folketing"/> Frederiksen attended the [[Aalborghus Gymnasium]]. She holds a bachelor in Administration and [[Social Science]] from [[Aalborg University]], and a Master in [[African Studies]] from the [[University of Copenhagen]].<ref name=DanishPrimeMinisters>{{cite web|url=https://www.stm.dk/_a_2857.html|title=List of Danish Prime Ministers Since 1848|publisher=Ministry of the State of Denmark|accessdate=31 August 2020|language=da}}</ref>

== Political career ==
Frederiksen worked as a youth consultant for [[LO, The Danish Confederation of Trade Unions]].<ref name="Folketing"/> She was elected as a member of parliament for [[Copenhagen County]] in the [[2001 Danish general election|2001 general election]] which saw the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] losing the first place and placing second for the first time since 1920.<ref name="Folketing"/> After her election, Frederiksen was named as her party's spokesperson for culture, media and gender equality.<ref name="Folketing"/> In 2002, she received the Nina Bang Prize for showing political courage, enthusiasm and impact with social feeling.<ref>[https://fho.dk/Nyheder/Nyhedsarkiv/2002/09/NINABANG-prisentilMetteFrederiksen.aspx "Nina Bang-prisen til Mette"]{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (in Danish). [[LO, The Danish Confederation of Trade Unions|LO]]. 12 September 2002.</ref> In addition, she received the Ting Prize in 2012 and has co-authored the books ''Epostler'' (2003) and ''From Fight to Culture'' (2004). After the [[2005 Danish general election|2005 general election]] loss, Frederiksen became her party's spokesperson for [[Social policy|social affairs]].<ref name="Folketing"/> Following the election, she also served as the vice-chairperson of the parliamentary group of the Social Democrats.<ref name="Folketing"/> In the [[2007 Danish general election|2007 general election]] which saw the Social Democrats losing two more seats, Frederiksen obtained 27,077 votes, placing her in seventh place in the ranking of the ten Danish politicians with the most votes.<ref>[https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/mette-frederiksen-slog-mogens-lykketoft "Mette Frederiksen slog Mogens Lykketoft"] (in Danish). [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]. 14 November 2007. Retrieved 15 June 2019.</ref>

In May 2010, it was revealed that Frederiksen's daughter, along with the children of several other prominent Social Democrat politicians, was being educated at a [[private school]].<ref name=Education>{{cite web|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/48953-opposition-under-fire-for-picking-private-schools.html|title=Opposition under fire for picking private schools|work=[[The Copenhagen Post]]|date=11 May 2010|accessdate=17 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120133920/http://cphpost.dk/news/national/88-national/48953-opposition-under-fire-for-picking-private-schools.html|archive-date=20 January 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Along with her colleagues, Frederiksen was accused of hypocrisy by the Danish press as her party had long seen the promotion of [[public education]] as a key policy.<ref name=Education/> In 2005, Frederiksen had openly criticised parents who sent their children to private schools.<ref name=Education/> Frederiksen responded to the criticism by saying that her opinion on private education had become more nuanced since her remarks in 2005 and that it would have been hypocritical of her to put her own political career ahead of her daughter's best interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/politik/article965267.ece|title=Mette Frederiksen: Min datter kommer først|work=[[Politiken]]|date=6 May 2010|language=da|accessdate=19 May 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509174927/http://politiken.dk/politik/article965267.ece|archive-date=9 May 2010}}</ref> After the [[2011 Danish general election|2011 general election]] which led to a Social Democrats government, Frederiksen served under [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]] as Minister of Employment from 2011 to 2014 and [[Minister of Justice of Denmark|Minister of Justice]] from 2014 until she succeeded her as party leader.<ref name=Folketing/><ref name=Politiken/> As Minister of Employment, she headed for reforms of early retirement pensions, flex jobs and the employment system. Likewise, the controversial cash assistance reform meant lower cash benefits for young unemployed and provided cohabiting mutual support, among other things.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Under Frederiksen's leadership starting after the [[2015 Danish general election|2015 general election]] in which the Social Democrats returned to first place and gained three seats in the [[Folketing]], the party has moved back to the left on economics while trying to outdo the Danish right-wing parties on having a hard line on [[immigration]].<ref name="The Guardian">{{cite news|last=Orange|first=Richard|title=Mette Frederiksen: the anti-immigration left leader set to win power in Denmark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/11/denmark-election-matte-frederiksen-leftwing-immigration?CMP=share_btn_fb|accessdate=12 May 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 May 2018}}</ref><ref name="Politico">{{cite web|last=O'Leary|first=Naomi|title=Danish left veering right on immigration|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/danish-copenhagen-left-veers-right-on-immigration-policy-integration/|date=6 September 2018|work=[[Politico]]|accessdate=13 September 2018}}</ref>

The [[2019 Danish general election|2019 general election]] saw the Social Democrats gaining a further seat while support for the [[Danish People's Party]] and the [[Liberal Alliance (Denmark)|Liberal Alliance]] collapsed, costing [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]] his majority. With the result beyond doubt on election night, Rasmussen conceded defeat.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48535939|title=Denmark election: Social Democrats win as PM admits defeat|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=6 June 2019|accessdate=6 June 2019}}</ref> Frederiksen was appointed Prime Minister on 27 June 2019, heading an exclusively Social Democratic minority government supported by the red bloc.<ref name="Government">{{cite web|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/folketingsvalg/loekke-mette-frederiksen-udpeget-som-kongelig-undersoeger|title=Løkke: Mette Frederiksen udpeget som kongelig undersøger|last=Ingvorsen|first=Emil Søndergård|publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]|date=6 June 2019|language=da|accessdate=16 June 2019}}</ref><ref name="DW"/> Despite having run on an [[anti-immigration]] stance during the election, Frederiksen shifted her stance on immigration by allowing more foreign labour and reversing government plans to hold foreign criminals offshore after winning government.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/mette-frederiksen-social-democrats-form-government-in-denmark/|title=Social Democrats form government in Denmark|newspaper=Politico|date=26 June 2019|accessdate=31 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/denmark-new-government-left-mette-frederiksen-welfare-spending-anti-immigration-a8975096.html|title=Denmark gets new left-wing government with plans to increase welfare spending and scrap anti-immigration measures|newspaper=The Independent|date=26 June 2019|accessdate=31 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/06/26/world/politics-diplomacy-world/denmark-becomes-third-nordic-country-form-leftist-government-year/|title=Denmark becomes third Nordic country to form leftist government this year|newspaper=The Japan Times|date=26 June 2019|accessdate=31 July 2019}}</ref>

Frederiksen gained international attention in August 2019 when [[President of the United States]] [[Donald Trump]] cancelled a state visit to Denmark following her refusal to sell [[Greenland]], an autonomous territory of Denmark. On 15 August, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Trump had discussed the possibility of buying Greenland with aides.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/ap-source-trump-has-talked-about-buying-greenland-for-us/2019/08/15/42fbeaa0-bfb3-11e9-a8b0-7ed8a0d5dc5d_story.html|title=AP source: Trump has talked about buying Greenland for US|date=15 August 2019|work=The Washington Post|access-date=22 August 2019|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> [[Kim Kielsen]], the [[Prime Minister of Greenland|Premier of Greenland]], responded by saying that Greenland is not for sale.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/world/europe/trump-greenland.html|title=‘Greenland Is Not for Sale’: Trump’s Talk of a Purchase Draws Derision|last=Sorensen|first=Martin Selsoe|date=16 August 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=22 August 2019|url-access=registration}}</ref> On 18 August, after the rumor was confirmed by the White House, Frederiksen echoed Kielsen's comments, saying that "Greenland is not Danish.

On 3 January 2020, the high-level Iranian General, [[Qasem Soleimani]], was [[2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike|assassinated by the United States]], which considerably heightened the [[2019–20 Persian Gulf crisis|existing tensions]] between the two countries. Frederiksen called it "a really serious situation". She avoided question on whether the killing was right, instead calling for de-escalation.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.berlingske.dk/politik/mette-f.-viger-uden-om-spoergsmaal-om-usa-angreb-paa-iran |title=Mette F. viger uden om spørgsmål om USA-angreb på Iran |date=5 January 2020 |work=Berlingske Tidende |agency=Ritzau |trans-title=Mette F. avoids question about USA attack on Iran}}</ref>

== Political positions ==
Frederiksen is a vocal opponent of [[prostitution]]. For many years, she has strongly advocated the prohibition of the purchase of sex as in [[Prostitution in Iceland|Iceland]], [[Prostitution in Norway|Norway]] and [[Prostitution in Sweden|Sweden]].<ref>[https://www.berlingske.dk/politik/socialdemokrater-vil-forbyde-koebesex "Socialdemokrater vil forbyde købesex"]. ''[[Berlingske]]'' (in Danish). 26 September 2009. Retrieved 12 June 2019.</ref> In 2002, she opened the debate on the prohibition of prostitution and was behind the 2009 congressional decision that the Social Democrats would "work for a ban on the purchase of sexual services".<ref>Kristensen, Kim; Kestler, Amalie (20 November 2012). [https://www.information.dk/indland/2012/11/koebesexforbud-vaeret-roedt-hjerteblod "Købesexforbud har været rødt hjerteblod"] (in Danish). ''[[Dagbladet Information]]''. Retrieved 15 June 2019.</ref> Frederiksen also became increasingly sceptical of [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] [[mass immigration]] as she believes it has had negative impacts for much of the population, a more pressing issue since at least 2001 after the [[11 September attacks]] which intensified during the [[2015 European migrant crisis]]. She has argued that perception of the Social Democrats adopting the [[Third Way]] and practicing [[centrist]], [[neoliberal economics]] and supporting unrestricted [[Economic globalisation|globalisation]] contributed to the party's poor electoral performance in the early 21st century. In a recent biography, Frederiksen stated: 'For me, it is becoming increasingly clear that the price of unregulated globalisation, mass immigration and the free movement of labour is paid for by the lower classes.'.<ref name="The Guardian"/><ref name="Politico"/>

Under Frederiksen, the Social Democrats voted in favor of a law allowing Danish authorities to confiscate money, jewellery and other valuable items from refugees crossing the border,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/01/denmark-refugees-asylum-immigrants-syria/429240/|title=Denmark Will Strip Refugees of Their Valuables|first=Feargus|last=O'Sullivan|work=CityLab|date=26 January 2016|accessdate=13 June 2019}}</ref> despite harsh condemnation from the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|United Nations Human Right Council]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.dk/20160121/danish-migrant-bill-blasted-at-un|title=Danish migrant bill blasted at UN|first=Nina|last=Larson|work=[[The Local]]|date=21 January 2016|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref> and widespread comparisons between the plan and the treatment of [[Jews]] in [[Nazi-occupied Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/12/17/denmark-wants-to-seize-jewelry-from-refugees/|title=Denmark wants to seize jewelry and cash from refugees|first=Rick|last=Noack|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=26 January 2016|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref> The Social Democrats voted for a law [[Burqa ban|banning wearing]] of [[burqa]]s and [[niqab]]s while abstaining during a vote on a law on mandatory handshakes irrespective of religious sentiment at citizenship ceremonies and on a plan to house criminal [[asylum seeker]]s on a bridgeless island on which they would have to stay at night. Frederiksen also backed the right-wing populist [[Danish People's Party]] in their paradigm shift push to make [[repatriation]] rather than [[Social integration|integration]] the goal of asylum policy. She has called for a cap on non-Western immigrants, expulsion of asylum seekers to a reception centre in North Africa and forced labour for immigrants in exchange for benefits. Labeling economic foreign policies of Europe as too [[Economic liberalism|liberal]], Frederiksen has criticised other social democratic parties for losing their voters' trust by failing to prevent globalisation chipping away at labour rights, increasing inequality and exposing them to uncontrolled immigration.<ref name="The Guardian"/>

Frederiksen has referred to [[Islam]] as a barrier to integration, arguing that some [[Muslims]] "do not respect the Danish judicial system", that some Muslim women refuse to work for religious reasons and that Muslim girls are subject to "massive social control" and has called for Muslim schools to be closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/10/denmark-swings-right-immigration-muslims-besieged-holbaek|title=Denmark swings right on immigration – and Muslims feel besieged|first=Richard|last=Orange|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 June 2018|accessdate=13 June 2019}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]'', Frederiksen called for the "closure of all immigrant centres" and for the "resettlement of immigrants in North Africa". These statements were strongly criticised by [[Morten Østergaard]] (secretary of the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Danish Social Liberal Party - Radical Left]]) and [[Cristina Narbona]] (president of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]]), who accused Frederiksen of [[xenophobia]]. However, her statements were praised by [[Sigmar Gabriel]] (former leader of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]) in an op-ed for ''[[Handelsblatt]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/meinung/gastbeitraege/gastkommentar-die-spd-sollte-sich-am-erfolg-der-daenischen-genossen-orientieren/24428330.html|title=Die SPD sollte sich am Erfolg der dänischen Genossen orientieren (The SPD should be guided by the success of its Danish comrades)|work=[[Handelsblatt]]|date=7 June 2019|language=de|accessdate=17 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/mondo/danimarca-leader-socialdemocratica-annuncia-chiuderemo-i-1711388.html|title=Danimarca, la leader socialdemocratica annuncia: "Chiuderemo i centri-profughi|last=Freda|first=Gerry|work=[[Il Giornale]]|date=15 June 2019|language=it|accessdate=15 June 2019}}</ref>
