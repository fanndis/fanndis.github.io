==Early life and education==
Brewer, a [[Detroit]] native, attended [[Cass Technical High School]] in Detroit. She completed her undergraduate education at [[Spelman College]], where she earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry.<ref name="profile"/><ref name="walmart"/><ref name="sams-club"/> She is a graduate of the Director's College at the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]]/[[Stanford Law School]], and she also attended an advanced management program at [[The Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref name="sams-club"/>

==Career==
Brewer had a 22-year career at [[Kimberly-Clark Corporation]].<ref name="profile"/><ref name="walmart" /> Starting out as a scientist, she eventually advanced to president of the Global Nonwovens Sector in 2004.<ref name="sams-club"/>

Brewer's career with Walmart began in 2006 with her position as regional vice president over operations in Georgia. From there, she became the division president of Walmart's Southeast market, then president of Walmart East.<ref name="sams-club" /> In 2012, Brewer was named President and CEO of Sam's Club, becoming the first African American to lead a Walmart division.<ref name="forbes" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/20/rosalind-brewer-sams-club_n_1219076.html |title=Rosalind Brewer, Named First Woman, African-American, CEO Of Sam's Club |work=The Huffington Post |date=January 20, 2012 |accessdate=October 4, 2014 }}</ref> She focused on health and wellness by doubling the amount of organic products offered at Sam's Clubs.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fortune's Most Powerful Women List|last = Bellstrom|first = Kristen|date = September 15, 2015|journal = Fortune|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>

In 2015 Brewer, then CEO of Sam's Club was interviewed on CNN by Poppy Harlow.  Brewer made the statement  "The entire other side of the table was all Caucasian male," she said. "That was interesting." She said that while she chose not to address it with everyone in the room, she was "going to place a call" to the supplier, indicating that there was a problem or that it should be wrong for a company to hire and employ all white men.  That comment spurred a lot of backlash due to Rosalind's quote being interpreted as thinking that companies should hire based because they are black or are a woman, rather than that one should be placed in a position based on their qualifications, which was perceived as a form of racial and sexual discrimination. 

In reality, Brewer was advocating for more diversity across corporate America. Walmart & Sam's Club supported Brewer's statement. 
Doug McMillon, Walmart President and CEO, subsequently wrote in a statement "For years, we've asked our suppliers to prioritize the talent and diversity of their sales teams calling on our company, Roz was simply trying to reiterate that we believe diverse and inclusive teams make for a stronger business. That's all there is to it and I support that important ideal."<ref <ref>https://money.cnn.com/2015/12/16/news/companies/rosalind-brewer-sams-club-diversity/index.html</ref> />

Brewer formerly served on the board of directors for [[Lockheed Martin Corporation]], and is chair of the board of trustees for Spelman.<ref name="sams-club" />

On February 1, 2017 Brewer was nominated for the Starbucks Board of Directors, and was named as COO in September of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blavity.com/starbucks-nominates-rosalind-brewer-to-board-of-directors|title=Starbucks Nominates Rosalind Brewer To Board of Directors|website=Blavity.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-17}}</ref><ref name="greenstone"/> Brewer is the second-highest-ranking executive at Starbucks after CEO Kevin Johnson.

In response, Brewer implemented policy changes and instituted racial bias training for employees in 8,000 stores on racial bias.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/profile/rosalind-brewer/#3dccda9a31d1] Forbes, "Power Women: Rosalind Brewer," 2018</ref>
