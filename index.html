										<h2>The data</h2>
										<p> The world is filled with data and for this project, the data could be endless. However, to limit the scope of <br>
											the project, the data that will be used is from three sources. The original data comes from Forbes, which makes <br>
											a list of the 100 most powerful women in the world every year. Forbes only gives access to the most recent year's <br>
											list, so the list from 2019 is the basis for this project. The list is extracted from <a href="https://littlesis.org/">Little Sis</a>, a site containing<br>
											databases describing top people in business and politics. Additionally, lists of the top 10 most powerful women <br>
											from the years 2004-2018 is gathered from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_list_of_The_World%27s_100_Most_Powerful_Women">Wikipedia</a>. Data from both websites is obtained to gather <br>
											information about the relationships the women have with other people, organizations and more. Finally, the Twitter <br>
											feeds from the women are gathered to be able to do an analysis on text written by them. To gain even more <br>

								 <h2 style='color:#87947f'> The two networks</h2>
								 <p style='color:#87947f'> Since the network data is gathered from two different sources, it is initially split into two.
									 The two networks, one containing data from Little Sis and the other from Wikipedia, are visualized using the Force Atlas 2 algorithm.
									 Each node in each network represents either a powerful woman or a person, organization, etc. obtained from the women's connections and relationships.
								     How the networks are constructed is further explained in the <a href="https://fanndis.github.io/generic.html"> data exploration</a> chapter.</p>
								 <br />
								 <center>
									 <img src="images/forceatlas.png" alt="" style="width:80%">
								 <center>
									<br />
								<p style='color:#87947f'> The left graph is the one containing information gathered from the Little Sis dataset.
									That graph consists of around 1.300 nodes with 2.000 links between them. The node with the most links has 163 connections, but
									the largest portion only has around 1 to 5 links.
								</p>
								<p style='color:#87947f'> The right graph then contains information gathered from the women's Wikipedia pages and is obviously musch larger and denser.
									This results in a whole lot of new nodes and connections. The nodes are around 12.700 and the links
									between them around 16.300. The node with the most links has 825 connections, but as with the other network,
									the largest portion only has around 1 to 5 links.
								</p>
								<p style='color:#87947f'> In both networks, the size of the node depends on it's number of connections, or the node's so-called degree.
									The more links a node has, the bigger it is on the graph.
								</p>
					 </section>

					 <!-- The two networks -->
					 <section id="four" class="wrapper style5 special">
						 <div class="inner">
							 <header class="major">
								 <h2 style='color:#87947f'>Most connected nodes</h2>
								 <p style='color:#87947f'> With a network of this size, it can be interesting and informative to see who the most
									connected nodes are. The network consists of two different types of nodes; the first type represents
									the powerful women themselves and the second the one the industries and people they have relations to. For a person
									to become powerful, it's a known fact that much importance lies in having the right connections.
								</p>
								<p style='color:#87947f'>
									Below are displayed four top 10 lists, each showing nodes with the highest degree.
									They are of nodes of each type, women and non-women. They are also
									split between the Little Sis dataset on one hand and then the combined dataset on the other hand. After
									having looked at the data, it was decided that this presentation would be the most informative. The reason
									for that is the size difference of the networks - the results for the combined network are practically the same
									as for the Wikipedia network, since it's so much larger than the Little Sis dataset. However, the Little Sis
									does have some interesting insights which Wikipedia doesn't, other kinds of relationships. As is known, Wikipedia tends
									to write large and informative articles on world famous people, but some of these most powerful women don't fall into
									that category. Doing a top 10 analysis only on the combined network would mean that the
									women who don't have many connections on their Wikipedia pages, simply because they aren't very known to the public,
									wouldn't show up. This, however, doesn't mean that they don't have important connections
									that should to be looked at.
								</p>
								<p style='color:#87947f'> By calculating the number of links that either go into or out of a node, the most <br>
									connected nodes in the networks can be found. </p>
								 <br />
								 <center>
									 <img src="images/most_connected.png" alt="" style="width:80%">
								 <center>
									<br>
								<p style='color:#87947f'>
									Here, it's interesting to see how much the top 10 lists differ from each other, the Little Sis network vs. the combined one.
									These are two rather different datasources, so they give different results. Ultimately, because of the considerably larger
									Wikipedia network, Little Sis isn't a big representative of the total data.<br>
									<br>
									When examining the top 10 women, Hillary Clinton is the only one present on both lists, having the highest number of connections
									in the combined network. This isn't a huge surprise - if a woman were the president of the United States then she would
									definitely be the most powerful woman in the world and Hillary has direct ties to the presidency. Her husband, Bill Clinton,
									was the president of the US from 1993 to 2001 and more importantly, Hillary herself has been very prevalent in US politics,
									even being the first woman to run for president of the US in 2016. Sadly, she lost narrowly to the mean orange man.<br>
									<br>
									For the Little Sis network, Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve Jobs' widow, is the most connected woman. This is due to the many
									positions she holds and many, many donations and grants she has given, which all are seperate nodes in the Little Sis dataset.
									Other women on the lists are tied to politics, business and arts, the artists being prevalent because of their extreme fame.<br>
									<br>
									Now, looking at the top 10 lists which don't include the women. The combined graph list contains a lot of magazines and
									publications, which is understandable since all these women have appeared on Forbes' (Forbes at no. 1) list of the 100 most
									powerful women in the world. On that list appear also two US presidents, Barack Obama and Donald Trump, as being in that position
									makes one extremely powerful. Notably is also "Bachelor of Arts", an educational degree, which might indicate that the most
									powerful women are rather educated in arts than sciences - interesting!<br>
									<br>
									For the Little Sis top 10 non-women, it's obvious that a lot of ties are to the US - there is also probably most data available
									from there. Barack Obama sits at the top following various political committees. The three other men appearing on the list are
									also American politicians. Lastly, Harvard business school makes an appearance with 11 connections, one of the most esteemed
									universities in the world.

						<div class="inner">
							<header class="major">
								<h2 style='color:#87947f'>Connections between the women</h2>
								<p style='color:#87947f'>
									Now, to get a good overview of which women this project revolves around, a labelled network graph
									is drawn below. As on the network graphs above, the node size increases with increased node degree.
									The middle of the graph contains all the women who have one or more connections to some of the other
									women. Women who don't have an internal connection are then arranged around the middle cluster. In
									total, the graph contains 129 women which have 114 undirected links between them.
								</p>
								<center>
									<img src="images/women_network.png" alt="" style="width:95%">
								<center>
								<br />
								<p style='color:#87947f'>
									It's quite easy to see who has the most internal connections - it is Hillary Clinton, the largest node
									of the network, with a connection to 32 other powerful women. The largest one behind her is Angela
									Merkel, chancellor of Germany since 2005, with 13 connections. She is also <b>the</b> most
									powerful woman in the world right now, having sat at the top of the list consistently since 2006,
									with an exception of then first lady of the USA Michelle Obama topping it in 2010
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_list_of_The_World%27s_100_Most_Powerful_Women">(source)</a>.
									Her dominance even continues, with her sitting at the top spot once again in the newly released
									<a href="https://www.forbes.com/power-women/list/">2020 list</a>. Other notable women in the network
									graph are for example Beyoncé, Oprah Winfrey and Condoleezza Rice. Beyoncé is one of the most famous
									singers in the world, Winfrey one of the most prevalent women in the entertainment industry and Rice
									a US politician, most notably a former US Secretary of State. Delving even further into this network
									and observing the links between the women is fascinating.

								<h2>Similarity between the most connected women<br /> </h2>
								<p>The most powerful women come from all over the world, and they all work in very different fields - but do they have any
								   similarities? This needs to be analysed by using text analysis. The Wikipedia data for the top 10 most connected women is
								   extracted, TF-IDF rankings made for each word in their pages and then a cosine similarity is used on all the words
								   between the top 10 women. The results can be seen in the matrix graph to the left, which mainly implies that the women
								   don't seem to have many similarities. However, there seem to be some minor similarities which are expected, such as between
								   the musicians and politicians. This can be seen by for example looking at the similarity of Beyoncé in regards to the other women.
								   She has the highest similarity with Lady Gaga, Rihanna and Taylor Swift - all famous singers.

									<h2 style='color:#87947f'>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
									<p style='color:#87947f'> Being powerful doesn't automatically make you a good person (in fact, it seems to be
										quite the contrary in many cases). By using sentiment
										analysis, the Wikipedia pages of each of the women is inspected to try and detect if the women have a positive
										or negative impact on society. However, since Wikipedia pages often tend to be quite neutrally written, the Twitter
										feeds of the women is also gathered to analyse text that they have written themselves and not only text that
										has been written about them. Are the two sentiments completely different?</p>
									 <p style='color:#87947f'> First, the sentiments from the Wikipedia pages are calculated and displayed. </p>
									<center>
										 <img src="images/sentimentanalysis.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
									 <center>
									<br />
									<p style='color:#87947f'> The sentiments for the most powerful women are quite similar, which is to be expected.
										According to the calculations, Jane Jie Sun is the most positive woman. Jane is a Chinese businesswoman and the
										CEO of the largest online travel agency in China. Jane's Wikipedia page is quite short, which means that when a
										positive word occurs in her article, it has a much higher value than when a positive word appearas on a longer
										page, which might be the reason for her being at the top of the positivity list. On the other end,
										Maria Macapagal Arroyo has been deemed the most negative woman. Maria is the former president of the Philippines
										who was accused of corruption. Those charges have since been dismissed but might explain her low score.  </p>
									<p style='color:#87947f'> Now, the sentiments from the Twitter feeds of the women are calculated. Unfortunately,
										only 58 of the women had a verified Twitter account, but the analysis could deliver some results none the less. </p>
									<center>
										 <img src="images/sentimentanalysis2.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
									 <center>
										 <br>
										 <p style='color:#87947f'> How interesting! Once again, the average sentiments are quite similar. This is
											interesting to see since the women presumably write their own tweets and therefore have free reign over
											what they write. However, this is understandable to quite an extent, since these are public figures
											who want to keep up a good reputation. They seem to be, as a result, quite composed in their tweets, not using
											particularly strong words.</p>
											<br>
											<p style='color:#87947f'> According to the calculations, Lady Gaga is the most positive powerful woman. 
												When looking at her twitter feed she tends to be quite positive in her tweets and doesn’t tweet about 
												negative things. The reason for her sentiment score not being higher than it already is could be because 
												she calls her fans “her little monsters”, so monster often appears on her feed, a word which has a negative 
												score. <br>
												Sophie Wilmés has the most negative sentiment score. Sophie is the Belgian deputy prime minister. When looking 
												at her twitter profile it is noticeable that many of her tweets are in French and unfortunately the sentiment 
												analysis only takes into account English words - so her sentiment score could be a little skewed. The reason for her 
												even having a score is that she retweets a lot of English tweets that are quite political and do contain 
												generally quite neutral words.
