								<p>The goal of this project is to delve deep into the most powerful women of the world by figuring out their most

								   Do these women have something in common?

										<h2>The data</h2>
										<p> The world is filled with data and for this project the data could be endless. To limit the scope of the project however the data that will be used is from three sources.
										First the list of 100 most powerful women of 2019 as well as lists of the top 10 most powerful women from 2004-2018 is gathered from the Forbes website.
										Then the Little sis website as well as wikipedia articles are used to gather information about the relationships the women have with organizations. Finally, the twitter feeds from the women is gathered to be able to do an analysis on text written by the women. To gain even more insights into the data exploration please <a href="https://fanndis.github.io/generic.html">press here.</a> </p>

								 <h2 style='color:#87947f'> The two networks</h2>
								 <p style='color:#87947f'> Since the data is gathered from two different sources initially there are two different networks.
									 The two networks, the network containing only the little sis data and the network containing only the wikipedia data are plotted using the force atlas algorithm.
								 How the networks are constructed is explained in the <a href="https://fanndis.github.io/generic.html"> data exploration chapter.</a></p>

								<p style='color:#87947f'> The left graph is the graph containing only information gathered from the Little Sis dataset. The graph consists of around 1.400 nodes. The right graph contains information gathered from the wikipedia pages of the women. The wikipedia pages resulted in alot of new nodes and connections, around 12.000. </p>

								 <h2 style='color:#87947f'>Most connected nodes</h2>
								 <p style='color:#87947f'> With a network of this size it can be very interesting to see what the most connected nodes are. The network consists of two different types of nodes, the first type represents the powerful women and the second the industries and people they have relationships with. For a person to become powereful it is important that they have the right connections.
								  Before the two networks mentioned above are combined their most connected nodes are analysed, the reason that they are analysed now instead of when the network has been connected is because the data gathered from the two sources is quite different. Wikipedia tends to write large and informative articles on world famous people which some of the most powerful women are not.
								Doing the analysis of the most connected nodes after the two networks have been combined would mean that the women who don't have many connections on their wikipedia pages simply because they aren't known to the public would mean that they wouldn't be looked at. This however doesn't mean that they don't have important connections that need to be looked at.  </a> </p>
								<br />
								<p style='color:#87947f'> By looking at the number of edges that either enter a node or leave it the most connected nodes in the graph can be found. </p>

								<h2>Similarity between the most connected women<br /> </h2>
								<p>The most powerful women come from all over the world, and they all work in very different fields, but do they have any similarity? This needs to be analysed by using text analysis. The wikipedia data for the top 10 most connected women was extracted, tf-idf ranking was added to each word in their pages and then a cosine similarity was used on all the words between the top 10 women. The results can be seen in the matrix graph where it can mainly be seen that there are not much similarities. However, there seem to be some minor similarities which was expected, such as between the musicians and politicians.This can be seen by for example looking at the similarity of Beyoncé to the other women. She has the highest similarity with Lady Gaga, Rihanna and Taylor Swift.

	 								<h2>Community detection</h2>
	 								<p> The Louvain method for community detection is used to detect communities within the network. 43 communities were found and will the word clouds of the top 6 communities with the biggest number of nodes be listed here below. </p>

	  								 <center>
	 									 <p>The first community, and the biggest one, centers around technology and finance. In the community there are around 40 of the most powerful women. To name a few: Abigail Johnson, Aileen Lee, Amy Hood, Julie Sweet, Lynn Good and Ruth Porat are all in this community. The women have one noticable thing in common - they are successful businesswomen in the financial sector.</p>

	  									 <img src="images/tennis_wordcloud.JPG" alt="" style="width:100%">
	  								 <center>
	 									 <p>The second community revolves around the game of tennis. Serena Williams is the only powerful woman in this community which is understandable since there are no other female athletes on the most powerful women lists. She stands alone! Phrases such as Wimbledon, doubles, singles and even game scores all appear in the wordcloud, everything related to tennis. </p>

	 									 <p>The fourth community revolves around the entertainment and arts industries. In the wordcloud there are words such as Dreamgirls, Presley and Hurston, which all relate to the industry mentioned. In the community there are three powerful women: Ava Duvernay, Oprah Winfrey and Bonnie Hammer, all a part of the entertainment industry. </p>

In the community there are five powerful women: Ana Botin, Judith McKenna, Kaherine Viener, Nichola Sturgeon and Theresa May, who all have in common that they are either of British descent or live and work in Britain.</p>

	  									 <img src="images/skritid_wordcloud.JPG" alt="" style="width:100%">
	  								 <center>
	 									 <p>The sixth community revolves around Hillary Clinton. In the wordcloud there are words that revolve around Hillary directly: Rodham, for example, which is her maiden name. Fresnel, which is the type of glass used in here eyeglasses since she has a particularly bad vision. Sarin, which is a lethal gas that she was accused of approving delivery of to Syrian Rebels. There must be some extensive data about these phenomena on Wikipedia! </p>

									<h2 style='color:#87947f'>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
									<p style='color:#87947f'> Being powerful automatically doesn't make you a good person. By using sentiment analysis the wikipedia pages of each of the women is inspected to try and detect if the women have a positive or negative impact on society. Since Wikipedia pages often tend to be quite neutrally written the Twitter feeds of the women is also gathered to analyse a text that they have written and not only a text that has been written about them. Are the two sentiments completely different?</p>
									 <br />
									 <p style='color:#87947f'> The sentiments from the wikipedia pages are first calculated. </p>
									<center>
										 <img src="images/sentimentanalysis.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
									 <center>
									<br />
									<p style='color:#87947f'> The sentiments for the most powerful women are quite similar which is to be expected. According to the calculations Jane Jie Sun is the most powerful woman. Jane is a Chinese business woman and the CEO of the largest online travel agency in China. Jane's wikipedia page is quite short which means that when a positive word occurs on her article it has a much higher value than when a positive word appearas on a longer page which might be the reason that she is at the top of the positivity list. Maria Macapagal Arroyo has been deemed the most negative woman. Maria is the former president of the Philippines who was accused of corruption, charges which have now been dismissed but might explain the negativity score.  </p>
									<br />
									<p style='color:#87947f'> The sentiments from the twitter feeds of the women are then calculated. Unfortunately only 58 of the women had a verified twitter account, but the analysis could be important none the less. </p>
									<br />
									<center>
										 <img src="images/sentimentanalysis2.png" alt="" style="width:100%">
									 <center>
										 <p style='color:#87947f'> How interesting! Once again the average sentiments are quite similar. This is very interesting to see since the women presumably write their own tweets and therefore have free reign over what they write.</p>
