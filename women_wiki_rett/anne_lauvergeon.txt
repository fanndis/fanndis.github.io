==Career==
===Early beginnings===
From 1985 to 1988, Lauvergeon was with the l'Inspection générale des carrières (IGC). In 1990, she was placed in charge of the mission for the international economy and foreign trade by French President [[François Mitterrand]]. The following year, she became assistant secretary general. She was then named "[[Sherpa (G8)|sherpa]]", i.e. personal representative to the president, and responsible for preparing international meetings such as the [[G7]] summit.

In 1995, Lauvergeon joined the banking sector, and became a managing partner of [[Lazard]]; she was the only woman partner at the firm.<ref>Peter Truell (13 November 1996), [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/13/business/heir-to-the-throne-at-lazard-freres-may-not-be-anymore.html Heir to the Throne at Lazard Freres May Not Be Anymore] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref> While at Lazard, she spent several months at the investment bank's New York office.<ref>John Tagliabue (26 November 2007), [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/26/business/worldbusiness/26iht-nuke.4.8485214.html The woman behind Areva of France] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref> In late 1996, she left the firm after difficulties with [[Édouard Stern]]; according to media reports at the time, Stern had particularly taken exception to an invitation that Lauvergeon received to join the board of French aluminum company [[Pechiney]].<ref>Peter Truell (13 November 1996), [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/13/business/heir-to-the-throne-at-lazard-freres-may-not-be-anymore.html Heir to the Throne at Lazard Freres May Not Be Anymore] ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.</ref>

In March 1997, Lauvergeon was appointed general director of [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]], before becoming part of the group's executive committee. In that capacity, she was responsible for international activities and the company's industrial shareholdings in the energy and nuclear fields.<ref>[https://www-origin1-vp.vodafone.com/content/index/media/vodafone-group-releases/2005/press_release21_09.html Vodafone appoints Anne Lauvergeon as Non-Executive Director] [[Vodafone]], press release of 21 October 2005.</ref>

===Career at Areva===
In June 1999 Lauvergeon was appointed CEO of the group [[Areva NC|Cogema]], succeeding [[Jean Syrota]], who resigned under pressure from [[The Greens (France)|The Greens]]. In July 2001, she merged Cogema, [[Framatome]] and other companies to create [[Areva]]. At the head of the new company, she became a member the small circle of women directing international corporations; in September 2002, daily economic newspaper ''[[Les Échos (France)|Les Échos]]'' uncovered a report from the French [[Court of Audit (France)|Court of Auditors]], citing Lauvergeon's compensation (salary of €305,000 with bonus of €122,000) and "[[golden parachute]]" of two years' wages.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In 2004, Lauvergeon resisted a request from [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], then finance minister, to help bail out French transport and energy company [[Alstom]].<ref>Geraldine Amiel and John M. Biers (17 June 2011), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304319804576389911380720894 France Replaces Areva's CEO] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> When Alstom's leadership announced plans in 2008 to create a heavy-engineering conglomerate by combining Alstom and Areva in a single entity, Lauvergeon reiterated her opposition.<ref>Nick Antonovics (26 February 2008), [https://www.reuters.com/article/areva-earnings/update-2-areva-2007-net-up-14-5-pct-dismisses-alstom-tie-up-idUSL2635735420080226 Areva 2007 net up 14.5 pct, dismisses Alstom tie-up] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref><ref>David Gauthier-Villars (23 February 2009), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123534029395743781 France's Areva Feels Its Power Wane] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref>

Under Lauvergeon, Areva instead developed into a one-stop shop for nuclear energy. The company became one of the world's top uranium producers and mining accounted for 12 percent of its 2010 revenue.<ref>Caroline Jacobs and Benjamin Mallet (22 February 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5E8DMANF20120222 Court tells Areva to sign Atomic Anne's payoff] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> On 10 July 2008 in the French economic paper ''[[Challenges (magazine)|Challenges]]'', she stated: "Uranium is a main part of our success. Our model is... Nespresso: we sell coffee machines and the coffee that fits them. And coffee is very profitable. So in China, we sold two nuclear islands, plus 35% of our uranium production. This is our integrated business model".<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.challenges.fr/magazine/0132-015836/le_modele_dareva_cest_nespresso.html L'interview – «le modèle d'areva, c'est... nespresso» – Challenges.fr]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Towards the end of 2006 Areva encountered difficulties with its new [[European Pressurized Reactor]] and announced an expected delay of eighteen months to three years for its delivery, according to the French daily newspaper ''[[La Tribune]]''.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [https://archive.is/20120805083940/http://www.latribune.fr/info/Areva---la-tension-monte-en-Finlande-~-20061205U6W6RYM-$Db=Archives/ArchivesProxy.nsf Areva : la tension monte en Finlande – La Tribune.fr<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The reactor is to be the first of its kind in [[Finland]].

In addition to her role at Areva, Lauvergeon was part of other political and business initiatives. In 2001, France's Minister of Science [[Roger-Gérard Schwartzenberg]] chose her to chair the "national contest of assistance the creation of companies of innovating technologies". In June 2010 Lauvergeon attended the [[Bilderberg Group|Bilderberg conference]] in [[Sitges]], Spain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/participants_2010.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=25 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114083158/http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/participants_2010.html |archivedate=14 January 2015  }}</ref>

By 2011, Lauvergeon came under fire due to cost overruns at the Areva-built [[Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant]] and the loss of a $40 billion contract in Abu Dhabi to a South Korean consortium.<ref>Lionel Laurent and Nina Sovich (21 March 2011), [https://www.reuters.com/article/areva-ceo/nuclear-scare-an-opportunity-for-embattled-areva-ceo-idUKLDE72G1LH20110321 Nuclear scare an opportunity for embattled Areva CEO] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> On 16 June 2011 [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[François Fillon]] announced that her mandate as head of Areva, terminating end of June 2011, would not be renewed. She was replaced by [[Luc Oursel]], member of the Areva board of management since 2007.<ref>[http://www.challenges.fr/entreprise/20140902.CHA7178/areva-enterre-l-ere-lauvergeon.html Areva enterre l'ère Lauvergeon], ''Challenges'', 2 September 2014</ref>

Since leaving Areva, Lauvergeon has been a partner and managing director of Efficiency Capital, an investment firm that focuses on energy, technologies, and natural resources. She is also chairman and CEO of A.L.P. SAS, an advisory company.<ref>[https://about.americanexpress.com/press-release/american-express-company-elects-anne-lauvergeon-board-directors American Express Company Elects Anne Lauvergeon to Board of Directors] [[American Express]], press release of 21 February 2013.</ref> By 2016, media reported that [[President of France|President]] [[François Hollande]] had proposed Lauvergeon to take over as chair of the board at [[EADS]] and had won the backing of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] of Germany for her candidature.<ref>Emmanuel Jarry and Tim Hepher (28 January 2013), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eads-nominations/lauvergeon-takes-center-stage-in-eads-board-shake-up-idUSBRE90Q0GG20130128 Lauvergeon takes center-stage in EADS board shake-up] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref><ref>Michael Stothard (13 May 2016), [https://www.ft.com/content/b0800228-1949-11e6-b197-a4af20d5575e Areva ex-chief under formal investigation over UraMin affair] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

===Controversy===
On 16 October 2009 Lauvergeon addressed journalists outside the "Women’s Forum" organised in [[Deauville]]. She declared: "To be clear, with same competences, sorry, we will choose the woman or something else rather than the white male." She said these words during the [[France 2]] evening news.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.france2.fr/france/Areva,-l-extr%C3%AAme-droite-et-le-m%C3%A2le-blanc-58329959.html |title=Areva, l'extrême droite et le "mâle blanc" |accessdate=18 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025084100/http://info.france2.fr/france/Areva%2C-l-extr%C3%AAme-droite-et-le-m%C3%A2le-blanc-58329959.html |archivedate=25 October 2009  |language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2009/10/22/01011-20091022FILWWW00626-l-extreme-droite-critique-lauvergeon.php L'extrême droite critique Lauvergeon]</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} {{YouTube|cLZD7xV582Y|Anne Lauvergeon déraille au Women's Forum}}</ref> This statement generated reaction and was chosen as an example by [[Éric Zemmour]] and [[Marine Le Pen]] to explain that [[positive discrimination]] was a kind of racism.

In 2011, Lauvergeon filed a legal complaint after she discovered a confidential report by private investigators on her husband Olivier Fric's business activities.<ref>Gerard Bon and Marie Maitre (21 December 2011), [https://www.reuters.com/article/areva/french-prosecutor-opens-areva-ex-ceo-spying-probe-idUSL6E7NL4R020111221 French prosecutor opens Areva ex-CEO spying probe] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> By 2012, she asked a French court to appoint an expert to examine the circumstances under which Areva ordered a probe in 2010 into the 2007 purchase of Canadian uranium mining firm UraMin; the request was subsequently denied.<ref>Caroline Jacobs (29 February 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/areva-lauvergeon/ex-areva-ceo-demand-for-uramin-report-probe-denied-idUSL5E8DTAX520120229 Ex-Areva CEO demand for UraMin report probe denied] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> An internal audit into the deal did not reveal fraud, but said that presentations made to state holding company [[Agence des participations de l'État|APE]] and to Areva's board about the planned UraMin acquisition had not given enough prominence to the doubts that the internal technical teams had expressed.<ref>Geert De Clercq, Gerard Bon and Nicolas Bertin (3 June 2014), [https://www.reuters.com/article/areva-uramin-search/update-1-areva-office-former-staffs-homes-searched-in-uramin-probe-idUSL6N0OK45T20140603 Areva office, former staff's homes searched in UraMin probe] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

Areva initially withheld Lauvergeon's 1.5 million euro ($2 million) severance pay due to the UraMin dispute.<ref>Caroline Jacobs and Benjamin Mallet (22 February 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5E8DMANF20120222 Court tells Areva to sign Atomic Anne's payoff] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> Also in 2012, a court ordered the company to sign a contract allowing Lauvergeon to receive her severance pay.<ref>Caroline Jacobs (29 February 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/areva-lauvergeon/ex-areva-ceo-demand-for-uramin-report-probe-denied-idUSL5E8DTAX520120229 Ex-Areva CEO demand for UraMin report probe denied] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

Only 11 days before the first round of the [[2012 French presidential election]], Lauvergeon accused Sarkozy in an interview with French weekly ''[[L'Express]]'' of having tried to sell an atomic reactor to Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] until mid-2010.<ref>Paul Taylor (11 April 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/france-election-nuclear/atomic-anne-tries-to-nuke-frances-sarkozy-idUSL6E8FB2GE20120411 "Atomic Anne" tries to nuke France's Sarkozy] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> In the interview, Lauvergeon also said Sarkozy had offered her a cabinet seat when he was elected in 2007 but she had refused.<ref>Paul Taylor (11 April 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/france-election-nuclear/atomic-anne-tries-to-nuke-frances-sarkozy-idUSL6E8FB2GE20120411 "Atomic Anne" tries to nuke France's Sarkozy] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> Sarkozy's spokeswoman [[Valérie Pécresse]] responded by accusing Lauvergeon of trying to "settle scores", calling her statements as "fictitious".<ref>Paul Taylor (11 April 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/france-election-nuclear/atomic-anne-tries-to-nuke-frances-sarkozy-idUSL6E8FB2GE20120411 "Atomic Anne" tries to nuke France's Sarkozy] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> At the time, Lauvergeon was tipped as a possible minister in a Socialist government under [[François Hollande]].<ref>Emmanuel Jarry and Yann Le Guernigou (17 April 2012), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-nuclear/french-sarkozy-denies-hawking-nuclear-reactor-to-gaddafi-idUSBRE83G0FF20120417 French Sarkozy denies hawking nuclear reactor to Gaddafi] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>
