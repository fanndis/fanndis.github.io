'''Yulia Volodymyrivna Tymoshenko''' ({{lang-uk|Юлія Володимирівна Тимошенко}}, {{IPA-uk|ˈjul⁽ʲ⁾ijɐ woloˈdɪmɪr⁽ʲ⁾iu̯nɐ tɪmoˈʃɛnko|IPA}}; {{née|'''Hrihyan'''}} ({{lang|uk|Грігян}});<ref name=Grigyan>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gCJpAAAAMAAJ An orange revolution: a personal journey through Ukrainian history] by [[Askold Krushelnycky]], [[Harvill Secker]], 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-436-20623-8}}, p. 169.</ref> born 27 November 1960) is a Ukrainian politician.

Tymoshenko is the leader of the [[All-Ukrainian Union "Fatherland"]] political party. She supports [[Ukraine]]'s integration into the [[European Union]] and strongly opposes the membership of Ukraine in the Russia-led [[Eurasian Customs Union]]. She supports [[NATO]] membership for Ukraine.

Tymoshenko co-led the [[Orange Revolution]] and was the first woman appointed [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]], serving from 24 January to 8 September 2005, and again from 18 December 2007 to 4 March 2010. She placed third in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine's [[Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women#2005 (top 10 selection)|list of the world's most powerful women]] in 2005.

Tymoshenko finished second in the [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election]] runoff, losing by 3.5 percentage points to the winner, [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. In the concluding days of the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]], she was released after [[Criminal cases against Yulia Tymoshenko since 2010|three years in jail]]. She again finished second in the [[2014 Ukrainian presidential election]], this time to [[Petro Poroshenko]]. After being a heavy favorite in the polls for several years, she came third in the first round of the [[2019 Ukrainian presidential election]].

===Commercial career===
Tymoshenko has worked as a practicing economist and academic. Prior to her political career, she became a successful but controversial businesswoman in the [[Natural gas|gas]] industry, becoming by some estimates one of the richest people in the country.

In 2000, Tymoshenko's government provided an additional 18&nbsp;billion Hryvna for social payments.

On 18 August 2000, [[Oleksandr Tymoshenko]], CEO of United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU) and Yulia Tymoshenko's husband, was detained and arrested.

===Campaigns against Kuchma and 2002 election===
On 9 February 2001, Tymoshenko founded the [[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]] (the National Salvation Committee merged into it),<ref name=Europe/> a political bloc that received 7.2% of the vote in the [[2002 Ukrainian parliamentary election|2002 parliamentary election]].

On 9 April 2003, the Kyiv Court of Appeal issued a ruling that invalidated and cancelled proceedings on the criminal cases against Yulia and Oleksandr Tymoshenko. Despite Tymoshenko being cleared of the charges, Moscow maintained an arrest warrant for her should she enter Russia.

Once the charges were dropped, Tymoshenko reassumed her place among the leaders of the grassroots [[Ukraine without Kuchma|campaign against President Kuchma]] for his alleged role in the murder of the journalist [[Georgiy Gongadze]]. In this campaign, Tymoshenko first became known as a passionate, revolutionist leader, an example of this being a TV broadcast of her smashing prison windows during one of the rallies. At the time, Tymoshenko wanted to organise a national referendum to [[impeach]] President Kuchma.<ref>Ian Jeffries (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=B3bwDpegCCYC&pg=PA549 The countries of the former Soviet Union at the turn of the twenty-first century: the Baltic and European states in transition], {{ISBN|978-0-415-25230-0}}, p. 542.</ref>

===Role in the Orange Revolution===
[[File:Timoshenko-bez-kosy.JPG|thumb|Yulia Tymoshenko]]
In the Autumn of 2001, both Tymoshenko and Viktor Yushchenko attempted to create a broad opposition bloc against the incumbent president, [[Leonid Kuchma]], in order to win the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|Ukrainian presidential election of 2004]].<ref name="Motherland"/>

In late 2002, Tymoshenko, [[Oleksandr Moroz]] ([[Socialist Party of Ukraine]]), [[Petro Symonenko]] ([[Communist Party of Ukraine]]) and Viktor Yushchenko ([[Our Ukraine (political party)|Our Ukraine]]) issued a joint statement concerning "the beginning of a state revolution in Ukraine". In the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, the communist party stepped out of the alliance, but the other parties remained allied and Symonenko was against a single candidate from the alliance<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Wp7VKL4p7kQC&pg=PA117 Understanding Ukrainian Politics: Power, Politics, and Institutional Design] by [[Paul D'Anieri]], [[M. E. Sharpe]], 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-7656-1811-5}}, p. 117.</ref> (until July 2006).<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5169068.stm Ukraine coalition born in chaos], BBC News (11 July 2006)</ref>

In March 2004, Tymoshenko announced that leaders of "Our Ukraine", BYuT and [[Socialist Party of Ukraine]] were working on a coalition agreement concerning joint participation in the presidential campaign. Tymoshenko decided not to run for president and give way to [[Viktor Yushchenko]]. On 2 July 2004, Our Ukraine and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc established the ''Force of the people'', a coalition which aimed to stop "the destructive process that has, as a result of the incumbent authorities, become a characteristic for Ukraine."  The pact included a promise by Viktor Yushchenko to nominate Tymoshenko as Prime Minister if Yushchenko should win the October 2004 presidential election. Tymoshenko was actively campaigning for Yushchenko, touring and taking part in rallies all over Ukraine. After Viktor Yushchenko had dropped out of the campaign due to his mysterious poisoning, Tymoshenko continued campaigning on his behalf.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.for-ua.com/news/2009/12/11/162738.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708110747/http://en.for-ua.com/news/2009/12/11/162738.html|archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=Tymoshenko does not regret supporting Yushchenko in 2004 |publisher=En.for-ua.com |date=11 December 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref>

After the initial vote on 31 October, two candidates – Viktor Yanukovych and Viktor Yushchenko – proceeded to a runoff. As Tymoshenko earlier envisaged, Yushchenko received endorsement from former competitors who didn't make it to the runoff, such as Oleksandr Moroz (Socialist Party), Anatoliy Kinakh (Party of Industrials and Entrepreneurs), former Kyiv city mayor Oleksanrd Omelchenko and others.

On 6 November 2004, Tymoshenko asked people to spread the orange symbols (orange was the color of Yushchenko's campaign). "Grab a piece of the cheapest orange cloth, make ribbons and put them everywhere" she said. "Don't wait until the campaign managers give those to you".

When allegations of fraud began to spread, the "orange team" decided to conduct a parallel vote tabulation during 21 November 2004 runoff and announce the results immediately to people on Independence Square (Maidan Nezalezhnosti) in Kyiv. Tymoshenko called Kyiv residents to gather on the square and asked people from other cities and towns to come and stand for their choice. "Bring warm clothes, lard and bread, garlic and onions and come to Kyiv" she said. On 22 November 2004, massive protests broke out in cities across Ukraine: The largest, in Kyiv's [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]], attracted an estimated 500,000 participants.<ref>{{cite news|last=Khokhlova |first=Veronica |title=New Kids on the Bloc |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A1FFE395A0C758EDDA80994DC404482 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=26 November 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106070544/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A1FFE395A0C758EDDA80994DC404482 |archive-date=6 November 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> These protests became known as the [[Orange Revolution]]. On 23 November 2004, Tymoshenko led the participants of the protest to the President's Administration. On Bankova Street, special riot police prevented the procession from going any further, so people lifted Tymoshenko up and she walked on the police's shields to the Administration building.

On 3 December 2004, the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine]] invalidated the results of the runoff and scheduled the re-run for 26 December 2004. After the cancellation of Viktor Yanukovych's official victory and the second round of the election, Viktor Yushchenko was elected president with 51.99% of votes (Yanukovych received 44.2% support).<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4035789.stm Profile: Viktor Yushchenko], BBC News (9 October 2008)</ref>

Increased salaries, pensions, scholarships; Fulfilled one of the paragraphs of social program from Yushchenko's election agenda on support for new families: in 2005 a social aid for a newborn child was increased 12 times; "Contraband stop" campaign was launched. The campaign was accompanied by eradication of shadow schemes in business; Call for nationalization and re-privatization of more than 3000 enterprises. Eventually the government nationalized and then re-privatized country's biggest metallurgical plant "Kryvorizhstal". In October 2005 it was sold for $4 billion to a new owner, which was an impressive amount compared to $8.5 billion received by the government from privatization between 1991 and 2004; On 16 June 2005 president Viktor Yushchenko, speaker of the Verkhovna Rada Volodymyr Lytvyn and Yulia Tymoshenko signed a memorandum on guarantees of ownership rights and ensuring lawfulness for their implementation. According to Yushchenko, "Ukrainian government brought murky privatization practice to the end"; Reaction to crises on internal market; In April–May 2005 Ukraine faced so called "meat, sugar and petrol crises" when prices for the abovementioned products went up by 30–50% over a couple of weeks. These crises allegedly resulted from a cartel conspiracy and it took Tymoshenko's government about 1,5 month to get the prices down to the initial level with the help of "goods intervention" mechanism; The meat crisis was caused by increased demand for meat as a result of increased salaries. Tymoshenko's government lifted duties on imported meat, which dropped the speculative prices Tymoshenko's political opponents (Yushchenko and Yanukovych) kept criticizing her for importing "low quality meat". At that time Tymoshenko's government made a decision to increase production of poultry, which eventually made Ukraine a poultry exporter. The sugar and petrol crises were caused by a "cartel conspiracy" which increased prices for the abovementioned goods by 30–50%. Tymoshenko's government organized import of cane sugar and dropped duties on oil products import. In a couple of months the prices stabilized. In 2006 Anti Monopoly Committee, who investigated the "sugar crisis" issued a conclusion which said that it was a cartel monopoly with a participation of Petro Poroshenko, then-head of the National Council of Security and Defense.
In May 2005, at the height of the petrol crisis, Viktor Yushchenko publicly sharply criticized Tymoshenko for "pressure on oil traders". |group=nb}} internal conflicts within the post‐Revolution coalition began to damage Tymoshenko's administration.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051118115613/http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/editorial/23161/ Zinchenko's bombshell], ''Kyiv Post'' (7 September 2005)</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120418221254/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/23653/ Oleksandr Zinchenko talks], ''Kyiv Post'' (21 December 2005)</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4226814.stm Orange Revolution in turmoil], BBC News (8 September 2005)</ref> On 24 August 2005, Viktor Yushchenko gave an Independence Day speech during which he called Tymoshenko's government "the best".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2005/08/24/3012700//|title=CEC: The statement by Yushchenko on the Maidan on the occasion of Independence Day|work= Ukrainian Pravda|date=24 August 2005|accessdate=24 August 2005}}</ref>

Soon after Tymoshenko's discharge in September 2005, the General Prosecutor Office of the Russian Federation dismissed all charges against her. On 18 November 2005, the Supreme Court of Ukraine issued a ruling which invalidated all criminal cases against Tymoshenko and her family.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://censor.net.ua/photo_news/186197/verhovnyyi_sud_postavil_tochku_v_dele_timoshenko_esche_v_2005_godu_dokument|title=CEC: The Supreme court put the point in the case of Tymoshenko in 2005.

With the Bloc coming second in the election, and winning 129 seats, many speculated that she might form a coalition with Yushchenko's "Our Ukraine" party and the Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU) to prevent the [[Party of Regions]] from gaining power.<ref name=pm2006/> Tymoshenko again reiterated her stance in regard to becoming prime minister.<ref name=pm2006>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4848958.stm Ukraine leaders jostle for power], BBC News (27 March 2006)</ref> However, negotiations with "Our Ukraine" and SPU faced many difficulties as the various blocs fought over posts and engaged in counter-negotiations with other groups.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1107869.stm Timeline: Ukraine], BBC News (last updated 26 October 2009)</ref>

Tymoshenko's nomination and confirmation as the new prime minister was expected to be straightforward. However, the political intrigue that took place broke the plan. BYuT partners "Our Ukraine" and Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU) could not come to agreement regarding distribution of powers, thus creation of the Coalition of Democratic Forces was put on hold. Yushchenko and oligarchs from his narrow circle were trying to impede Tymoshenko from returning to the office of Prime Minister. Her nomination was preconditioned on the election of her long-time rival [[Petro Poroshenko]] from "Our Ukraine" to the position of speaker of the parliament.

After lengthy negotiations, SPU suddenly pulled out of the Coalition and joined the alliance with the Party of Regions and the Communist Party of Ukraine. Oleksandr Moroz assured that the team of Viktor Yushchenko was conducting secret negotiations with the Party of Regions. According to that deal, Viktor Yanukovych was supposed to become the speaker, while Yuriy Yekhanurov kept the prime minister portfolio.

On 4 April 2007, president Yushchenko issued an edict "On early termination of duties of the Verkhovna Rada" as a reaction to violation of the Constitution by the Party of Regions, which had started dragging individual deputies into the "ruling coalition" (this being illegal, as coalitions should be formed by factions and not by individual deputies). In doing so, the Party of Regions was trying to achieve a constitutional majority of 300 votes which would enable prime minister Yanukovych to override the president's veto and control the legislative process. Party of Regions didn't obey this edict. In order to dismiss the Verkhovna Rada, Yulia Tymoshenko and her supporters in the parliament (168 deputies from BYuT and "Our Ukraine" factions) quit their parliamentary factions on 2 June 2007. That step invalidated the convocation of the Verkhovna Rada and cleared the path to an early election.

An early parliamentary election was held on 30 September 2007.

On 18 December, Tymoshenko was once again elected as Prime Minister (supported by 226 deputies, the minimal number needed for passage), heading the [[second Tymoshenko Government]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Parliament named Tymoshenko as the Prime Minister of Ukraine|url= http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/politics/319536-parlament-naznachil-timoshenko-premer-ministrom-ukrainy|work= [[Korrespondent]]|date= 18 December 2007|accessdate= 18 December 2007 | language =ru}}</ref>

===Second Term as Prime Minister 2007–2010, and 2008 political crisis===
{{main|Second Tymoshenko Government}}
On 11 July 2008, Party of Regions tried to vote no-confidence to Tymoshenko's government in the parliament, but could not collect enough votes.<ref>[http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/52072/Premier-survives-no-confidence-vote Premier survives no confidence vote], [[Daily Express]] (11 July 2008)</ref>

The coalition of Tymoshenko's Bloc (BYuT) and Yushchenko's Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc (OU-PSD) was put at risk due to deliberate misinterpretation of Tymoshenko's opinion on the ongoing [[2008 South Ossetia War]] between [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and Russia. Yushchenko's office accused her of taking a softer position in order to gain support from Russia in the upcoming 2010 election. Andriy Kyslynskyi, the president's deputy chief of staff, went as far as to accuse her of 'high treason'.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/ukraine-pm-accused-of-high-treason/84135/|title=Ukraine PM Accused of 'High Treason'|publisher=The New York Sun|date=19 August 2008|accessdate=19 February 2011}}</ref>

When Tymoshenko resumed her prime minister duties in 2007, she initiated direct relations between Ukraine and Russia with regard to gas trading. A 2 October 2008 Memorandum signed by Tymoshenko and Vladimir Putin stipulated liquidation of intermediaries in gas deals between the two countries and outlined detailed conditions for future gas contracts. The gas conflict of 2009 broke out because of two factors, the lack of a gas contract for 2009 and a $2.4&nbsp;billion debt that Ukraine had yet to pay for gas received in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20081120/118434473.html |title=Medvedev tells Gazprom to recover $2.4 bln gas debt from Ukraine |publisher=En.rian.ru |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref> Prime Minister Tymoshenko stated that it was the "RosUkrEnergo" company that was responsible for the debt, rather than the state of Ukraine.

"RosUkrEnergo", with the aid of its ties to Yushchenko's administration, managed to disrupt the signing of a gas contract scheduled for 31 December 2008. [[Alexey Miller|Oleksiy Miller, head of "Gazprom"]], stated that trader "RosUkrEnergo" broke down talks between "[[Gazprom]]" and "Naftogaz Ukrainy": "Yes indeed, in late December 2008, the prime ministers of Russia and Ukraine came to agreement, and our companies were ready to seal the deal for $235 per 1000 cubic meters of natural gas with the condition that all the export operations from Ukraine will be done bilaterally. RosUkrEnergo then suggested to buy gas at $285 price." On 31 December 2008, president Viktor Yushchenko gave Oleg Dubyna, head of "Naftogaz Ukrainy", a direct order to stop talks, not sign the agreement and recall the delegation from Moscow. The decision made by the president of Ukraine brought on the crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zik.ua/en/news/2010/03/06/219714 |title=Oleh Dubyna Yushchenko and RUE guilty of 20-day gas spat with Russia in 2008 |publisher=Zik.ua |accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/9758x75e |title=Prosecution witness confirms links between Yushchenko and RosUkrEnergo (audio) |publisher=Tymoshenko.ua |accessdate=28 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215231540/http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/9758x75e |archive-date=15 December 2013 }}</ref>

On 14 January 2009, Prime Minister Tymoshenko said, "The negotiations on $235 gas price and $1.7–1.8 transit price, that started on October 2 and successfully have been moving forward since, have been broken up because, unfortunately, Ukrainian politicians were trying to keep "RosUkrEnergo" in business as a shadow intermediary... The negotiations between the two prime ministers and later between "Gazprom" and "Naftogaz Ukrainy" were ruined by those Ukrainian political groups, who have gotten and are planning to get corrupt benefits from "RosUkrEnergo"." On 17 January 2009, President of Russia Dmitriy Medvedev said, "I think that our Ukrainian partners and us can trade gas without any intermediaries, especially without intermediaries with questionable reputation. The problem is that some participants of negotiations insisted on keeping the intermediary referring to the instructions from the top."<ref>{{cite web|last=Bierman |first=Stephen |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=agCru3iDPGAA |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022141903/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=agCru3iDPGAA |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 October 2013 |title=Russia-Ukraine Gas Row May Center on RosUkrEnergo, Analyst Says |publisher=Bloomberg |date=8 January 2009 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref>

Between 1 and 18 January, Central and Eastern European countries received significantly less gas. Ukrainian heat-and-power stations were working to utmost capacity. Due to sub-zero temperatures, the entire housing and public utilities sectors were on the verge of collapse. On 14 January, the European Commission and the Czech presidency in the European Union demanded the immediate renewal of gas deliveries in full capacity lest the reputations of Russia and Ukraine as reliable EU partners be seriously damaged. On 18 January 2009, after five-day-long talks, prime ministers Putin and Tymoshenko came to agreement on the renewal of gas delivery to Ukraine and other EU countries. The parties agreed upon the following: A return to direct contract deals between "Gazprom" and "Naftogaz Ukrainy"; the removal of non-transparent intermediaries; the introduction of formula-based pricing for Ukraine (which also works for other Eastern European countries); and a switch to a $2.7 transit fee, which is close to the average price in Europe.

On 1 December 2009, Tymoshenko urged "national democratic forces" to unite around the candidate who garnered the largest number of votes after the first round of the presidential elections.

In the first round of the presidential election on 17 January 2010, Tymoshenko took second place with 25% of the vote, and Yanukovych took first place with 35%. The two proceeded to a [[two-round system|runoff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2010/01/18/4630133/|title=OFFICIAL ELECTION RESULTS 2010.

On 3 February 2010, two days before the run-off, the deputies from Party of Regions, Communist Party of Ukraine, "Our Ukraine – People's Self-Defense" bloc and independent MPs amended the Law on Election of President, which changed the mode of composition and functioning of election commissions. BYuT warned that these amendments would create opportunities for the massive rigging of elections. Tymoshenko called on president Yushchenko to veto the law. Hanne Severinsen, former rapporteur of PACE Monitoring Committee on Ukraine, also called on the president to veto the law. Severinsen's statement read: "Unfortunately, the Party of Regions, as in 2004, is trying to create conditions for vote fraud."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/67xmnoz4 |title=Hanne Severinsen: Party of Regions trying to repeat 2004 |publisher=Tymoshenko.ua |accessdate=28 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111224530/http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/67xmnoz4 |archive-date=11 November 2013 }}</ref>

She called on the democratic parliamentary factions to not seek "political employment" at the Party of Regions (meaning to avoid negotiations with the Party of Regions regarding the new coalition) and to "quit arguing and create a united team that would not let an anti-Ukrainian dictatorship usurp the power".

====Appeal====
[[File:Судять.jpg|thumb|Yulia Tymoshenko in 2011.]]
On 24 October 2011, Tymoshenko filed an appeal to the decision of Pechersk district court of Kyiv regarding the "gas case".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/ukrainian/politics/2011/10/111024_tymoshenko_appeal_ak.shtml|title=Tymoshenko filed the appeal on a sentence on "gas business"|publisher= Bbc.com|date=24 October 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref> On 1 December, the Kyiv Court of Appeal started hearing the case. Tymoshenko herself was not present in the courtroom because of her health condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosvoboda.mobi/a/24408285.html|title=The court considered possible a preliminary review of the complaint Tymoshenko without her|publisher= Radio Svoboda|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref> After the hearing, the judge, Olena Sitaylo, had to call an ambulance and was hospitalized. On 13 December 2011, the Kyiv Court of Appeal resumed the hearing. All subsequent court sessions took place without Tymoshenko's presence. Immediately prior to the hearing of the appeal, the board of judges was altered: Sitaylo, the chief justice, was appointed the day before the first hearing; other justices were appointed several days prior to the court session.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://novaukraina.org/news/urn:news:AA7F7D|title=The trial of Tymoshenko will continue "in any weather"|publisher=Novaukraina.org|date=20 December 2011|accessdate=20 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105224441/http://novaukraina.org/news/urn:news:AA7F7D|archive-date=5 January 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Thus, the judges did not have time to study the 84-page case log. The manner of the process proved that the decision to alter the board of judges was made beforehand. At the very end, Tymoshenko's defense boycotted the court session.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fakty.ictv.ua/ua/index/read-news/id/1437911|title=Protection of Tymoshenko will not go to court|publisher= Fakty.ictv.ua|date=22 December 2011|accessdate=22 December 2011}}</ref>

On 23 December 2011, the Kyiv Court of Appeal issued a ruling which fully supported the verdict of the Pechersk court. The judges didn't find any violations during the pre-trial investigation or trial on the "gas case", overruling the claims of Tymoshenko's defense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.for-ua.com/news/2011/12/14/125211.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709040426/http://en.for-ua.com/news/2011/12/14/125211.html|archive-date=9 July 2012 |title=Court of Appeals leaves Yulia Tymoshenko in custody |publisher=En.for-ua.com |date=14 December 2011 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref>

====Cassation====
On 26 January 2012, Tymoshenko's defense submitted a [[Court of cassation|cassation appeal]] to the High Specialized Court for Civil and Criminal Cases regarding the "gas case" verdict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.for-ua.com/news/2012/01/26/144035.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709112624/http://en.for-ua.com/news/2012/01/26/144035.html|archive-date=9 July 2012 |title=Tymoshenko's defense submitted cassation appeal against "gas sentence" |publisher=En.for-ua.com |date=26 January 2012 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref> On 16 August 2012, after a 7-month delay that impeded filing the case to the European Court of Human Rights, the panel of judges of the aforementioned court began hearing the case. The panel finished hearing the case on 21 August and went to the jury room to make decision. The ruling of the Court, issued on 29 August 2012, stated that the appeal of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko's defense on the "gas case" should not be satisfied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/court-reads-out-cassation-complaints-against-tymoshenkos-gas-case-verdict-311681.html |title=Tymoshenko's cassation in gas case read out in court |publisher=Kyivpost.com |date=17 August 2012 |accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref>

Media, diplomats, members of parliament and members of an EU special monitoring mission, Pat Cox and Aleksander Kwaśniewski, attended the court sessions. The ruling was announced on the day following public hearing of "Tymoshenko vs Ukraine" (regarding unlawful arrest of ex-prime minister and holding her in custody) case at the European Court of Human Rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbc.ua/ukr/analytics/espch-nachal-publichnye-slushaniya-po-delu-timoshenko-protiv-28082012143100|title=The European Court of human rights has completed its public hearings in the case "Tymoshenko against Ukraine"|publisher= Rbc.ua|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref>
