Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton}}</ref> (''{{nee}}'' '''Rodham'''; born October 26, 1947) is an American politician, diplomat, [[lawyer]], writer, and [[Public speaking|public speaker]] who served as the [[List of Secretaries of State of the United States|67th]] [[United States Secretary of State|United States secretary of state]] from 2009 to 2013, as a [[United States Senator|United States senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] from 2001 to 2009, and as [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1993 to 2001. Clinton became the first woman to be nominated for [[president of the United States]] by a major political party when she won the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination in [[2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2016]]. She was the first woman to win the popular vote in an American presidential election, which she lost to [[Donald Trump]].

Raised in the Chicago suburb of [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]], Clinton graduated from [[Wellesley College]] in 1969 and earned a [[Juris Doctor]] from [[Yale Law School]] in 1973. After serving as a [[congressional staff|congressional legal counsel]], she moved to [[Arkansas]] and married future president [[Bill Clinton]] in 1975; the two had met at Yale. In 1977, she co-founded [[Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families]]. She was appointed the first female chair of the [[Legal Services Corporation]] in 1978 and became the first female partner at Little Rock's [[Rose Law Firm]] the following year. ''[[The National Law Journal]]'' twice listed her as one of the hundred most influential lawyers in America. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992. As First Lady of the United States, Clinton advocated for [[Healthcare reform in the United States|healthcare reform]]. In 1994, her major initiative—the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|Clinton health care plan]]—failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in advocating the creation of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]], and the [[Foster Care Independence Act]]. Clinton [[Women's Rights Are Human Rights|advocated for gender equality]] at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women|1995 UN conference on women]]. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the [[Lewinsky scandal]], which led her to issue a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to the marriage.

In 2000, Clinton was [[2000 United States Senate election in New York|elected]] as the first female [[List of United States Senators from New York|senator from New York]]. She was [[2006 United States Senate election in New York|re-elected in 2006]] and chaired the [[United States Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee|Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee]] from 2003 to 2007. During her Senate tenure, Clinton advocated for medical benefits for [[Health effects arising from the September 11 attacks|first responders whose health was damaged]] in the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{Cite web|last1=McAfee|first1=Tierney|url=https://people.com/celebrity/911-how-hillary-clinton-and-donald-trump-responded-to-attacks/|title=How Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Responded to the 9/11 Attacks|website=PEOPLE.com|date=September 9, 2016|access-date=August 21, 2019}}</ref> She supported the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. In 2008, Clinton [[Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign|ran for president]] but was defeated by eventual winner [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic primaries]]. Clinton was U.S. secretary of state in the first term of the [[Obama Administration]] from 2009 to 2013. During her [[Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State|tenure]], Clinton established the [[Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review]]. She responded to the [[Arab Spring]] by [[War Powers Resolution|advocating]] [[military intervention in Libya]] but was harshly criticized by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the [[2012 Benghazi attack]]. Clinton helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and a regime of international sanctions against [[Iran]] in an effort to force it to curtail its [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]]; this effort eventually led to the multinational [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|JCPOA nuclear agreement]] in 2015. [[Hillary Clinton email controversy|Her use of a private email server]] when she was Secretary of State was the subject of intense scrutiny; while no charges were filed against Clinton, the email controversy was the single most covered topic during the 2016 presidential election.

Clinton made a [[Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign|second presidential run in 2016]]. After winning the Democratic nomination, she ran in the general election with Virginia senator [[Tim Kaine]] as her [[Vice President of the United States|running mate]]. Clinton lost the [[2016 United States presidential election|presidential election]] to Republican opponent [[Donald Trump]] in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] despite winning a plurality of the [[Popular vote (representative democracy)|popular vote]]. Following her loss, she wrote her third memoir, ''[[What Happened (Clinton book)|What Happened]]'', and launched [[Onward Together]], a [[501c4|political action organization]] dedicated to fundraising for [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] political groups. She is the current [[Chancellor (university)|chancellor]] of [[Queen's University Belfast]] in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

She saw evidence of [[electoral fraud]] (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate [[Richard Nixon]],{{sfn|Gerth|Van Natta|2007|p=19}} and later volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate [[Barry Goldwater]] in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 election]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Middendorf, J.

Rodham's early political development was shaped mostly by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent [[anti-communist]]), who introduced her to Goldwater's ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]'' and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of [[social justice]]), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] at a 1962 speech in Chicago's [[Orchestra Hall (Chicago)|Orchestra Hall]].<ref>Troy 2006, p.&nbsp;15; Gerth and Van Natta 2007, pp.&nbsp;18–21; Bernstein 2007, pp.&nbsp;34–36. The teacher, Paul Carlson, and the minister, Donald Jones, came into conflict in Park Ridge; Clinton would later see that as "an early indication of the cultural, political and religious fault lines that developed across America in the [next] forty years". (Clinton 2003, p.&nbsp;23) Several dates have been published for the King speech she witnessed, but April 15, 1962, is the most likely, see {{cite news |last1=Dobbs |first1=Michael |title=Hillary and Martin Luther King Jr. |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2007/12/hillary_and_martin_luther_king.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 31, 2007}}</ref>

==Marriage, family, law career and first ladyship of Arkansas==
===From the East Coast to Arkansas===
During her postgraduate studies, Rodham was staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded [[Children's Defense Fund]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]],{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=91–92}} and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.<ref>Brock 1996, p.&nbsp;42.</ref> In 1974, she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in Washington, D.C., and advised the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]] during the [[Watergate scandal]].{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=94–96, 101–03}} Under the guidance of Chief Counsel [[John Doar]] and senior member [[Bernard W.

By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future. Democratic political organizer and consultant [[Betsey Wright]] moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide Rodham's career.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|p=62}} Wright thought Rodham had the potential to become a future senator or president.{{sfn|Maraniss|1995|p=277}} Meanwhile, boyfriend Bill Clinton had repeatedly asked Rodham to marry him, but she continued to demur.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=90, 120}} After failing the [[District of Columbia]] [[Multistate Performance Test|bar exam]]<ref>Bernstein 2007, p.&nbsp;92; Allen and Parnes 2014, p.&nbsp;149.

As she later wrote, "I chose to follow my heart instead of my head".<ref>Clinton 2003, p.&nbsp;69.</ref> She thus followed Clinton to Arkansas, rather than staying in Washington, where career prospects were brighter. He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in his home state. In August 1974, Rodham moved to [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]], and became one of only two female faculty members in the [[University of Arkansas School of Law|School of Law]] at the [[University of Arkansas, Fayetteville]].{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|p=92}}<ref>Clinton 2003, p.&nbsp;70.

===Early Arkansas years===
At the university, Rodham taught classes in criminal law. She was considered a rigorous teacher who was tough with her grades.{{sfn|Maraniss|1995|p=328}} Rodham became the first director of a new [[legal aid]] clinic at the school, where she secured support from the local bar association and gained federal funding.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=126–27}} As a court-appointed lawyer, Rodham was required to act as defense counsel to a man accused of raping [[Kathy Shelton|a 12-year-old girl]]; after her request to be relieved of the assignment failed, Rodham used an effective defense and counseled her client to plead guilty to a lesser charge. She has called the trial a "terrible case".<ref name="pf-def">{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2014/jul/17/did-hillary-clinton-ask-be-relieved-rapist/ |title=Did Hillary Clinton ask to be 'relieved' from representing an accused rapist in 1970s? |author=Contorno, Steve |publisher=[[PolitiFact]] |date=July 17, 2014}}</ref> During her time in Fayetteville, Rodham and several other women founded the city's first rape crisis center.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=126–27}} Rodham still harbored doubts about getting married; she was concerned that her separate identity would be lost, and that her accomplishments would be viewed in light of someone else.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=62, 90, 117}}

Failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the House or the Senate (although Democrats controlled both chambers), the proposal was abandoned in September 1994.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=287–89, 400–02}} Clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat but cited many other factors.

===Whitewater and other investigations===

Clinton was a subject of several investigations by the [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel]], committees of the U.S. Congress and the press.

The [[Whitewater controversy]] was the focus of media attention from its publication in a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' report during the 1992 presidential campaign<ref name="nyt030892">{{Cite news |author=Gerth, Jeff |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/08/us/1992-campaign-personal-finances-clintons-joined-s-l-operator-ozark-real-estate.html |title=Clintons Joined S.& L.

The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated [[Madison Guaranty]], a [[savings and loan]] institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm{{sfn|Gerth|Van Natta|2007|pp=72–73}} and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses.

Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, an action that became known as "[[White House travel office controversy|Travelgate]]", began with charges that the White House had used audited financial irregularities in the Travel Office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from Arkansas.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=327–28}} The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo led to the investigation being focused on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=439–44}}<ref>{{Cite news |author=Johnson, David |title=Memo Places Hillary Clinton at Core of Travel Office Case |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 5, 1996 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/05/us/memo-places-hillary-clinton-at-core-of-travel-office-case.html}}</ref> The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made "factually false" statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Hughes, Jane |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/802335.stm |title=Hillary escapes 'Travelgate' charges |work=[[BBC News]] |date=June 23, 2000}}</ref>

An outgrowth of the "Travelgate" investigation was the June 1996 discovery of improper White House access to hundreds of FBI background reports on former Republican White House employees, an affair that some called "[[White House FBI files controversy|Filegate]]".<ref name="cnn072800"/> Accusations were made that Clinton had requested these files and she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the White House Security Office.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/01/filegate/index.html |title='Filegate' Depositions Sought From White House Aides |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=April 1, 1998}}</ref> The 2000 final Independent Counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that Clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter.<ref name="cnn072800">{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/07/28/clinton.filegate/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030124154710/http://edition.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/07/28/clinton.filegate/ |archivedate=January 24, 2003 |title=Independent counsel: No evidence to warrant prosecution against first lady in 'filegate' |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=July 28, 2000}}</ref>

In early 2001, a controversy arose over gifts that were sent to the White House; there was a question whether the furnishings were White House property or the Clintons' personal property.

===Response to Lewinsky scandal===
{{Further|Clinton–Lewinsky scandal}}

In 1998, the Clintons' private concerns became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with 22-year-old White House intern [[Monica Lewinsky]].<ref>Troy 2006, pp.&nbsp;176–77.</ref> Events surrounding the [[Lewinsky scandal]] eventually led to the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]] of the president by the House of Representatives; he was later acquitted by the senate. When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that the allegations were part of a "[[vast right-wing conspiracy]]".<ref>Troy 2006, p.&nbsp;183.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Grant |first1=Philippe R.|editor1-last=Knight|editor1-first=Peter |title=Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia |url=https://archive.org/details/conspiracytheori00knig_851 |url-access=limited |date=2003 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=978-1576078129 |page=[https://archive.org/details/conspiracytheori00knig_851/page/n194 177] |quote=Concerned by the many conspiracy theories involving her husband, [she] claimed&nbsp;... there was a 'vast right-wing conspiracy' to undermine their credibility.}}</ref> She characterized the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Bill's political enemies{{efn|Clinton was referring to the [[Arkansas Project]] and its funder [[Richard Mellon Scaife]], Kenneth Starr's connections to Scaife, [[Regnery Publishing]] and its connections to [[Lucianne Goldberg]] and [[Linda Tripp]], [[Jerry Falwell]], and others.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/02/02/time/kirn.html |title=Persecuted or Paranoid?

She later said she had been misled by her husband's initial claims that no affair had taken place.<ref>Troy 2006, p.&nbsp;187.</ref> After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage. Privately, she was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to remain in the marriage.{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|pp=512, 517–18, 521}} The White House residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period.<ref>Brower 2015, pp. 141–49.</ref>

Public reaction varied. Women variously admired her strength and poise in private matters that were made public. They sympathized with her as a victim of her husband's insensitive behavior and criticized her as being an [[Codependency|enabler]] to her husband's indiscretions. They also accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence.{{sfn|Gerth|Van Natta|2007|p=195}} In the wake of the revelations, her public approval ratings shot upward to around 70&nbsp;percent, the highest they had ever been.{{sfn|Gerth|Van Natta|2007|p=195}} In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to "a love that has persisted for decades" and add: "No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met."<ref>Clinton 2003, p.&nbsp;75.</ref>

Issues that surrounded the Lewinsky scandal left Bill Clinton with substantial legal bills. In 2014, Hillary would say she and Bill had left the White House "not only dead broke, but in debt". The statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earning power of ex-presidents who give paid speeches after leaving office. The couple would also have the ability to secure loans from banks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-and-bill-were-dead-broke/ |title=Hillary Clinton says she and Bill were 'dead broke' |author=Greenberg, Jon |publisher=PolitiFact.com |date=June 10, 2014}}</ref>

When New York's long-serving U.S. senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] announced his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative [[Charles Rangel]] of New York, urged Clinton to run for his open seat in the [[2000 United States Senate elections|Senate election of 2000]].{{sfn|Bernstein|2007|p=530}} Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in [[Chappaqua, New York]], north of New York City, in September 1999.<ref>{{Cite news |author=Nagourney, Adam |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/03/nyregion/with-some-help-clintons-purchase-a-white-house.html |title=With Some Help, Clintons Purchase a White House |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 3, 1999 |authorlink=Adam Nagourney}}</ref> She became the first wife of the president of the United States to be a candidate for elected office.{{sfn|Gerth|Van Natta|2007|p=204}} Initially, Clinton expected to face [[Rudy Giuliani]]—the mayor of New York City—as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after being diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public. Clinton then faced [[Rick Lazio]], a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives who represented [[New York's 2nd congressional district]]. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of [[Parachute candidate|carpetbagging]], because she had never resided in New York State or participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.{{sfn|Gerth|Van Natta|2007|pp=200, 204}}

[[Bill de Blasio]] was Clinton's campaign manager. She began her drive to the U.S. Senate by visiting all 62 counties in the state, in a "listening tour" of small-group settings.{{sfn|Gerth|Van Natta|2007|p=210}} She devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican [[Upstate New York]] regions. Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000&nbsp;jobs to the state over her term. Her plan included tax credits to reward job creation and encourage business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://cgi.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/07/senate.ny/ |title=Hillary Rodham Clinton scores historic win in New York |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=November 8, 2000 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115201929/http://cgi.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/07/senate.ny/ |archivedate=January 15, 2016 }}</ref>

On December 19, a panel led by [[Thomas R. Pickering]] and [[Michael Mullen]] issued its report on the matter. It was sharply critical of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment.<ref name="upi-arb">{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2012/12/19/Clinton-accepts-Benghazi-panel-guidance/UPI-34121355896475/ |title=Three in State Dept. resign after report |agency=[[United Press International]] |date=December 19, 2012}}</ref> It focused its criticism on the department's [[Bureau of Diplomatic Security]] and [[Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs]]; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/us/politics/3-state-dept-officials-resign-following-benghazi-report.html |title=4 Are Out at State Dept.

Clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions in response to the incident, and while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security.<ref name="cnn-0123-hearings">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/23/politics/clinton-benghazi/index.html |title=Clinton takes on Benghazi critics, warns of more security threats |author=Dougherty, Jill |author2=Cohen, Tom |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=January 24, 2013}}</ref> Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning about whether or not the administration had issued inaccurate "talking points" after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make?

==Email controversy==
{{Main|Hillary Clinton email controversy}}

A controversy arose in March 2015, when the State Department's [[inspector general]] revealed that Clinton had used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server exclusively—instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private [[Message transfer agent|messaging system]] software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, and federal laws and regulations governing [[Records management|recordkeeping requirements]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/soros-advised-clinton-on-handling-albania-unrest--08-11-2016|title=Soros 'Advised Clinton on Handling Albania Unrest'|website=balkaninsight.com|access-date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> The controversy occurred against the backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/us/politics/using-private-email-hillary-clinton-thwarted-record-requests.html |title=Using Private Email, Hillary Clinton Thwarted Record Requests |author=Schmidt, Michael S. |author2=Chozick, Amy |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 3, 2015}}</ref><ref name="wapo-email">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/state-department-reviewing-whether-clinton-e-mail-violated-security-rules/2015/03/05/16d1547e-c378-11e4-9271-610273846239_story.html |title=Clinton email review could find security issues |author=Leonnig, Carol D. |author2=Helderman, Rosalind S. |author3=Gearan, Anne |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 6, 2015}}</ref>

In a joint statement released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so at the time of their inspection and "never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system". They also stated unequivocally this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems.

Clinton maintained she did not send or receive any emails from her personal server that were confidential at the time they were sent. In a Democratic debate with [[Bernie Sanders]] on February 4, 2016, Clinton said, "I never sent or received any classified material—they are retroactively classifying it." On July 2, 2016, Clinton stated: "Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now, I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-investigation-sheds-light-hillary-clintons-past-email/story?id=40350589 |title=FBI Probe Contradicts Clinton's Claim She Never Sent Classified Emails |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=July 5, 2016 |accessdate=July 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kessler |first=Glenn |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/27/clintons-claims-about-receiving-or-sending-classified-material-on-her-private-email-system/ |title=Clinton's claims about receiving or sending 'classified material' on her private e-mail system |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=August 27, 2015 |accessdate=July 12, 2016}}</ref>

On July 5, 2016, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] concluded its investigation. In a statement, FBI director [[James Comey]] said:

<blockquote>110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was Top Secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained Secret information at the time; and eight contained Confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional e-mails were "up-classified" to make them Confidential; the information in those had not been classified at the time the e-mails were sent.<ref name="fbi.gov">{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b.-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clintons-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system |title=Statement by FBI Director James B.

Out of 30,000, three emails were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were marked only with a small "c" in parentheses, described as "portion markings" by Comey. He also said it was possible Clinton was not "technically sophisticated" enough to understand what the three classified markings meant.<ref name="Kiely"/> The probe found Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Comey acknowledged that it was "possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton's personal email account". He added that "[although] we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information". Nevertheless, Comey asserted that "no reasonable prosecutor" would bring criminal charges in this case, despite the existence of "potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information". The FBI recommended that the Justice Department decline to prosecute.<ref name="fbi.gov"/> On July 6, 2016, U.S. Attorney General [[Loretta Lynch]]—who had met privately with Bill Clinton on June 27<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/29/politics/bill-clinton-loretta-lynch/index.html |title=Bill Clinton meeting causes headaches for Hillary |first=Eli |last=Watkins |website=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/loretta-lynch-bill-clinton-meet-privately-in-phoenix|title=Conflict?

On October 28, 2016, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had begun looking into newly discovered Clinton emails. Law enforcement officials said that while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from [[Anthony Weiner]], husband of Clinton aide [[Huma Abedin]], to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered emails related to Clinton's private server on a laptop computer belonging to Weiner.

On January 2, 2020, it was announced that Hillary Clinton would take up the position of Chancellor at [[Queen's University Belfast]] after her husband had previously played a role in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] and the signing of the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]]. Clinton became the 11th and first female chancellor of the university, filling the position that had been vacant since 2018 after the death of her predecessor, [[Thomas J. Moran (businessman)|Thomas J. Moran]]. Commenting on taking up the position, she said that "the university is making waves internationally for its research and impact and I am proud to be an ambassador and help grow its reputation for excellence". Queen's Pro-Chancellor Stephen Prenter said that Clinton on her appointment "will be an incredible advocate for Queen's" who can act as an "inspirational role model".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moriarty |first1=Gerry |title=Hillary Clinton appointed chancellor of Queen's University Belfast |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/hillary-clinton-appointed-chancellor-of-queen-s-university-belfast-1.4128734 |website=The Irish Times |accessdate=January 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-50970400|title=Hillary Clinton is new chancellor of NI university|last=Meredith|first=Robbie|date=January 2, 2020|work=BBC News|access-date=January 21, 2020|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In March 2016, Clinton laid out a detailed economic plan, which ''The New York Times'' called "optimistic" and "wide-ranging". Basing her economic philosophy on [[inclusive capitalism]], Clinton proposed a "clawback" that would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; providing incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an "exit tax" on companies that move their headquarters out of America to pay a lower tax rate overseas.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/us/politics/hillary-clinton-offers-economic-plan-focused-on-jobs.html |title=Clinton Offers Economic Plan Focused on Jobs |last=Chozick |first=Amy |date=March 4, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}</ref> Clinton currently opposes the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership|Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)]] (though she previously described it as "the gold standard"<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-lauded-controver/ |title=Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton lauded controversial Trans-Pacific trade deal |newspaper=@politifact|access-date=November 7, 2016}}</ref> of trade deals).
