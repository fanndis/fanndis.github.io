'''Georgina Hope''' "'''Gina'''" '''Rinehart''' ([[Name at birth|née]] '''Hancock''', born 9 February 1954) is an Australian mining magnate. Rinehart is the Executive Chairman of [[Hancock Prospecting]], a [[Privately held company|privately-owned]] mineral exploration and extraction company founded by her father, [[Lang Hancock]]. 

Rinehart was born in [[Perth, Western Australia]], and spent her early years in the [[Pilbara]]. She boarded at [[St Hilda's Anglican School for Girls]] and then briefly studied at the [[University of Sydney]], dropping out to work with her father at Hancock Prospecting. She was Lang Hancock's only child, and when he died in 1992{{snd}}leaving a bankrupt estate{{snd}}she succeeded him as executive chairman. She turned a company with severe financial difficulties into the largest private company in Australia and one of the largest private mining houses in the world.

When Rinehart took over Hancock Prospecting, its total wealth was estimated at {{AUD}}75&nbsp;million, which did not account for groups liabilities and contingent liabilities. She oversaw an expansion of the company over the following decade, and due to the iron ore boom of the early 2000s became a nominal billionaire in 2006. In the 2010s, Rinehart began to expand her holdings into areas outside the mining industry. She made sizeable investments in [[Ten Network Holdings]] and [[Fairfax Media]] (although she sold her interest in the latter in 2015), and also expanded into agriculture, buying several [[cattle stations]].

Rinehart is one of Australia's richest people; with ''[[Forbes Asia|Forbes]]'' estimating her [[net worth]] in 2019 at {{USD}}14.8&nbsp;[[1,000,000,000|billion]] as published in the [[List of Australians by net worth|list of Australia's 50 richest people]];<ref name="Forbes2019"/> and ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]'' estimating her net worth at {{AUD}}28.89&nbsp;billion as published in the [[Financial Review Rich List 2020|2020 ''Financial Review'' Rich List]].<ref name="afr2020"/> {{as of|2020|09}} ''Forbes'' considered Rinehart one of the world's ten richest women.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The 10 Richest Women in the World 2020|url=https://www.forbes.com/stories/the-10-richest-women-in-the-world-2020/|access-date=2020-09-29|website=www.forbes.com}}</ref> Rinehart was [[Forbes list of Australia's 50 richest people|Australia's wealthiest person]] from 2011 to 2015, according to both ''Forbes'' and ''The Australian Financial Review''; and again in 2020, according to ''The Australian Financial Review''.<ref name="afr2020"/> Her wealth peaked at around {{AUD}}29&nbsp;billion in 2012, at which point she overtook [[Christy Walton]] as the [[List of female billionaires|world's richest woman]] and was included on the [[Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women|''Forbes'' list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women]]. Rinehart's net worth dropped significantly over the following few years due to a slowdown in the Australian mining sector; rebuilt again during 2020 due to increased demand for Australian [[iron ore]].<ref name="ore">{{cite news |url=https://www.afr.com/rich-list/rich-list-2020-marks-the-rise-of-the-ore-ligarchs-20200917-p55wmp |title=Rich List 2020 marks the rise of the ore-ligarchs |url-access=subscription |work=[[The Australian Financial Review]]|publisher=Nine Publishing|date=29 October 2020|author1=Sprague, Julie-anne|accessdate=31 October 2020}}</ref>

After the death of her father in March 1992, Rinehart became Executive Chairman of Hancock Prospecting Pty Limited (HPPL) and the HPPL Group of companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/gina-rinehart-sues-nine-entertainment-over-hancock-drama-falsehoods-20150302-13sz5x.html|title=Gina Rinehart sues Nine Entertainment over Hancock drama 'falsehoods'|last=Lynch|first=Jared|date=2 March 2015|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hancockprospecting.com.au/meet-our-team-2/|title=Meet Our Team|website=Hancock Prospecting PTY LTD|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref> All companies within the group are [[Privately held company|privately-owned]]. With the notable exception of receiving a royalty stream from [[Hamersley Iron]] since the late 1960s, Lang Hancock's mining activities were mainly related to exploration and the accumulation of vast mining leases. The BBC journalist, Nick Bryant, argues that while Rinehart was a beneficiary of her father's royalty deals, she "transformed the family business by spotting, early than most, the vast potential of the China market."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bryant|first=Nick|title=The Rise and Fall of Australia: How a great nation lost its way|publisher=Bantam|year=2014|isbn=9780857983787|location=North Sydney|pages=222}}</ref> Of course that doesn’t realize the enormous amount of work that went into exploring, achieving government approvals, studies, achieving financial markets, and construction, and now one mega mine, four major mines,several smaller mines. Nor does it recognise that until 2000, the royalties had to be used to pay off liabilities caused by Lang Hancock’s disaster forays into Eastern European Countries, in particular, Romania. And nor does it recognise the royalties from a very important part of Hancock Prospecting groups revenue stream. Less than 3%, with part of the committed under the constitution of the company to be paid to shareholders, hence part is not available for the company.

Rinehart  achieved the Roy Hill tenements in 1993, The year after her father’s death, having applied for them five months after her father’s passing, and focused on developing Roy Hill And Hancock Prospective undeveloped deposits, raising capital through joint venture partnerships and turning the leases into revenue producing mines.<ref name="smh-2011" />

Hancock Prospecting, now owns 50 per cent of Hope Downs and shares of 50 per cent of the profits generated by the 4 [[Hope Downs mine]], which is operated by [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] under a joint management committee and produces 47 million tonnes of iron ore annually. Another joint venture with Mineral Resources Limited at [[Nicholas Downs mine|Nicholas Downs]], northwest of Newman, is producing 500 million tonnes of [[Manganese|ferruginous manganese]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The Alpha Coal, Tads Corner and Kevin's Corner projects in [[Central Queensland]],are expected to produce 30 million tonnes of coal each. The Roy Hill Iron ore project, south of Port headline, in the Pilbara produces 60 million tonnes a year, with approvals pending to reach 70 million tonnes per annum.

Since 2010 Rinehart has been actively promoting the cause of development of Australia's north and has spoken, written articles and published a book on this topic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rinehart|first=Gina|title=Northern Australia and then some: Changes we need to make our country rich|year=2012|publisher=Executive Media Pty Ltd|isbn=9781921345258|url=http://www.andev-project.org/resources/book-launch-media-pack/}}</ref> Rinehart stresses that Australia must do more to welcome investment and improve its cost competitiveness, particularly when Australia faces record debt.

==Personal wealth==

Rinehart is one of Australia's richest people; with ''[[Forbes Asia|Forbes]]'' estimating her [[net worth]] in 2019 at {{USD}}14.8&nbsp;[[1,000,000,000|billion]] as published in the [[List of Australians by net worth|list of Australia's 50 richest people]];<ref name="Forbes2019"/> and ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]'' estimating her net worth in 2020 at {{AUD}}28.89&nbsp;billion, the wealthiest Australian as published in the [[Financial Review Rich List 2020|2020 ''Financial Review'' Rich List]].<ref name="afr2020"/> ''Forbes'' considers Rinehart one of the world's richest women.

Rinehart first appeared on the 1992 Financial Review Rich List (at the time called the BRW Rich 200, published annually in the ''[[BRW (magazine)|BRW]]'' magazine, following the death of her father earlier that year. She has appeared every year since, and became a billionaire in 2006. Due to Australia's [[Iron ore mining in Western Australia|mining boom]] in the early 21st century, Rinehart's wealth increased significantly since 2010, and she diversified investments into media, taking holdings in Ten Network Holdings and Fairfax Media. According to ''BRW'', she became Australia's richest woman in 2010, and Australia's richest person in 2011, and the first woman to lead the list. During 2012, ''BRW'' claimed Rinehart was the world's richest woman, surpassing Wal-Mart owner [[Christy Walton]].<ref name="Ferguson5">{{cite journal|author=Ferguson, Adele|url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/sections/features/rinehart_world_richest_woman_JucE8ndw9hYfzDk5NuudTI|title=Rinehart world's richest woman|journal=BRW|location=Sydney|date=4 June 2012|accessdate=23 August 2013}}</ref>
