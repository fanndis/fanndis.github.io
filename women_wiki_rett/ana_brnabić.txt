===Debate on constitutional roles===
Political scientists Krzysztof Zuba listed Brnabić as an example of the head of government with extensive political dependence on a leader of the governing party.<ref name=Zuba>{{cite journal|last1=Zuba|first1=Krzysztof|title=Leaders without Leadership: Surrogate Governments in Poland |journal=Europe-Asia Studies |date=2019|volume=72|pages=33–54|doi=10.1080/09668136.2019.1673321|s2cid=211437470}}</ref> He defined situations in which the Prime Minister does not have their own political position as the chief of the executive as a “surrogate governments”, explaining that the distribution of power that is contrary to constitutional determinants is a characteristic of non-democratic systems.<ref name=Zuba></ref>

In February 2019, [[Freedom House]] report that Serbia's [[Freedom in the World|status]] declined from ''Free'' to ''Partly Free'' due to deterioration in the conduct of elections, continued attempts by the government and allied media outlets to undermine independent journalists through legal harassment and smear campaigns, and Vučić's accumulation of executive powers that conflict with his constitutional role. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/Feb2019_FH_FITW_2019_Report_ForWeb-compressed.pdf|title=Freedom in the World 2019|date=5 January 2019|website=Freedom House}}</ref> Opposition leaders and some observes describe her as a mere [[Puppet ruler|puppet]] of Vučić, whose presidency according to the [[Constitution of Serbia|Constitution]] is largely ceremonial with no significant executive power.<ref name=Surk></ref><ref name=Zuba></ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.dn.pt/mundo/servia-escolhe-primeira-mulher-para-liderar-governo-e-agradar-a-ue-8621224.html | title=Serbia chooses first woman to lead government and please EU | work=[[Diário de Notícias]] | date=7 July 2017 | access-date=16 October 2019 | author=Gouveia, José Fialho | language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/most-pavicevic-popovic/29167687.html | title=Ana Brnabić: Premijerka ili Vučićeva marioneta | publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]] | date=15 April 2018 | access-date=16 October 2019 | author=Karabeg, Omer | language=sh}}</ref> Brnabić never denied this, and even said that Vučić should act as a "mentor" of prime minister.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.danas.rs/politika/brnabic-vucic-da-ima-ulogu-mentora-nad-premijerom/ | title=Brnabić: Vučić da ima ulogu mentora nad premijerom | publisher=Danas | date=6 June 2017 | access-date=16 October 2019 | language=sr}}</ref>

===Kosovo===
{{see also|Political status of Kosovo}}
In December 2018, Commenting on the announced transformation of the [[Kosovo Security Force]] into the Kosovo Armed Forces, Brnabić said: "I hope we won’t have to use our military, but at the moment, that’s one of the options on the table because one cannot witness a new [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Serbs and new [[Operation Storm|Storms]] - although [[Edi Rama]] is calling for them. When someone knows you have a strong army, then they have to sit down and talk to you."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2018&mm=12&dd=05&nav_id=105684|title=I hope Serbia won't have to use army - but it's an option |date=5 December 2018|publisher=B92|access-date=12 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/serbian-pm-armed-intervention-in-kosovo-an-option/2018/12/05/3fe412f4-f888-11e8-8642-c9718a256cbd_story.html?noredirect=on|title=Serbian premier: Armed intervention in Kosovo an option |date=5 December 2018|work=The Washington Post|access-date=12 December 2018}}</ref>

In addition, in May 2019, Foreign Minister of Kosovo [[Behgjet Pacolli]] said that he would not allow Brnabić to enter Kosovo because of, what he said is, her racist ideology. Brnabić, during the handover of a [[European Commission]] 2019 progress report, said: "[[Ramush Haradinaj|Haradinaj]], [[Hashim Thaçi|Thaçi]] and [[Kadri Veseli|Veseli]] are competing to see who the biggest [[nationalist]] and [[chauvinist]] is.
