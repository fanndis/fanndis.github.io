'''Zhou Qunfei''' ({{zh|s=周群飞}}; born 1970) is a Chinese entrepreneur who founded the major [[touchscreen]] maker [[Lens Technology]]. After the public listing of her company on the [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange|Shenzhen]] [[ChiNext]] market in March 2015, her net worth reached US$10 billion, making her the richest woman in China.<ref name=scmp>{{cite news |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1758319/zhou-qunfei-lowly-factory-worker-chinas-richest-woman |title=Zhou Qunfei: from lowly factory worker to China's richest woman |author=Daniel Ren |date=7 April 2015 | newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref> In 2018, she was named the world's richest self-made woman, with a net worth of $9.8 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43326764|title=China dominates self-made woman rich list|last=|first=|date=2018-03-08|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-08}}</ref>

==Early life==
Zhou Qunfei was born in 1970 in [[Xiangxiang]], [[Hunan]] province, China, the youngest of three children in a poor family. Before she was born, her father, a former soldier, became partially blinded and lost a finger in an industrial accident in the 1960s. A skilled craftsman, he supported the family by making bamboo baskets and chairs and repairing bicycles. Her mother died when she was five. As a child she helped her family raise animals for sustenance and small profit. Although she was the only one out of her siblings to attend secondary school and showed promise as a bright student, she dropped out at age 16 and moved in with her uncle's family to become a [[migrant worker]] in [[Shenzhen]], the [[special economic zone]] in [[Guangdong]] province.<ref name=scmp/><ref name=ny /> While she briefly considered pursuing a government job for its stability, she discarded the idea as lacking a diploma would make it difficult to do so.<ref name=afr />

In Shenzhen she deliberately chose to work for companies near [[Shenzhen University]], so she could take part-time courses at the university. She studied many subjects and passed the examinations to be certified for [[accounting]], computer operations, customs processing, and even became licensed for driving commercial vehicles. Her biggest regret is not having studied English.<ref name=sina>{{cite news |url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/s/20150402/100121872236.shtml |script-title=zh:女首富周群飞首度回应传闻：我不是小三 23岁做老板 |author=Jin Zhu |language=Chinese |date=2 April 2015 | newspaper=Sina}}</ref>

==Career==
Although she dreamed of being a fashion designer, Zhou found a job working for a small family-run firm making watch parts for about 180 yuan a month.<ref name=afr /> Displeased with the working conditions, she decided to quit after three months and submitted a letter of resignation explaining her reasons, yet expressing gratitude for the working opportunity. The letter moved the factory chief to offer her a promotion instead.<ref name=ny />

When the factory folded, she established her own company in 1993 at age 22,<ref name=scmp/> with her savings of HK$20,000 (~USD$3,000<ref name=ny />). It was her cousin who encouraged her to start on her own business, and the company began with her brother, sister, their spouses, and two cousins all working out of a three bedroom apartment.<ref name=sina/> The company appealed to customers by promising higher-quality watch lenses. Here, Zhang took a hands on approach and involved herself in all parts of the company, including repairs and creating improved designs of factory machinery.<ref name=ny /> In 2001, she caught her big break when her company won a profitable contract to make [[mobile phone]] screens for the Chinese electronics giant [[TCL Corporation]].<ref name=scmp/>

Zhou Qunfei has stated that over the years she has started a total of 11 companies.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/newstock/yjbg/20150317/133421739968.shtml |script-title=zh:低调不了的准女首富:蓝思科技掌门周群飞陷豪门恩怨漩涡 |author=Zheng Wei |language=Chinese |date=17 March 2015 | newspaper=Sina}}</ref>

==Lens Technology==

In 2003, while still producing watch faces, Zhou's company received a request from [[Motorola]] to develop glass screens for their [[Motorola Razr|Razr V3]], during a period when the [[mobile phone]] industry was transitioning from plastic to glass display screens.<ref name=ny />

Following this, Zhou Qunfei started touch-screen maker Lens Technology (named so that it would turn up to potential customers searching "lens" online)<ref name=bloomberg /> in 2003 and the company soon received orders from other mobile-phone makers such as [[HTC]], [[Nokia]], and [[Samsung Electronics]].<ref name="scmp" />  After producing the touch screens for [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone]] during its 2007 market entry, Lens developed into the dominant player of the industry. Lens Technology now primarily supplies touch-screens to leading electronics makers such as Apple, Samsung, and [[Huawei]], receiving nearly 75% of its revenue from Apple and Samsung.<ref name=ny /> The [[Apple Watch]] uses her company's glass and [[sapphire crystal]] screens. As of 2017, the company employs about 90,000 people, was expected to churn out more than a billion glass screens, and has 32 different factory locations.<ref name= ny /><ref name="scmp" /><ref name="afr" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/zhou-qunfei-richest-woman-world-lens-technology-life-career-how-she-made-money-a7846171.html|title=The school dropout who became the world's richest woman|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en-GB}}</ref>

On 18 March 2015, the 22nd anniversary of the founding of her first start-up,<ref name=sina/> Lens Technology began trading on the [[ChiNext]] [[A-share (mainland China)|A-share]] market of the [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]]. The company's stock price rose by the market's daily limit of 44% on the first day and 10% every subsequent day for 13 days in a row between 19 March and 2 April.<ref name="scmp" /> This made Lens Technology China's largest technology [[IPO]] in the first quarter of 2015.<ref name="mpw">{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/most-powerful-women-asia-pacific/zhou-qunfei-18/|title=Fortune 2016 MPW Asia Pacific|last=|first=|date=|website=Fortune|publisher=Fortune|access-date=6 August 2016}}</ref>

==Accomplishments==
During Lens' 2015 IPO offering, Zhou's (who holds 87.9% of the shares, a $7.2 billion stake as of July 2015) net worth rose 452%, dethroning [[Chen Lihua]] as China's richest woman.<ref name="scmp" /><ref name="afr" />   She also holds the position of the world's richest self made woman, and is one of the richest women in the technology sector.<ref name="scmp" />

Additionally, Zhou is on [[Forbes]] lists as #61 in 2016 Power Women, #205 in 2016 Billionaires (#9 out of Hong Kong billionaires), #18 in 2015 China Rich List, and #30 in 2015 Richest in Tech.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/zhou-qunfei/|title=Zhou Qunfei|last=|first=|date=|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|access-date=6 August 2016}}</ref>  [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] ranked her #18 on their 2016 Most Powerful Women of Asia-Pacific list, and she is a newcomer to the list.<ref name="mpw" /> [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] has ranked her as #211 out of the world's billionaires.<ref name="bloomberg" />

==Personal life==
Zhou Qunfei married her former factory boss, had a daughter, and divorced.<ref name=ny /> Her daughter is currently studying overseas. In 2008, she married Zheng Junlong ({{lang|zh-Hans|郑俊龙}}), a longtime factory colleague who currently serves on the Lens board and has a 1.4% shareholding in the company. They have a seven-year-old son who lives at their Hong Kong family home.<ref name=ny>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/business/international/how-zhou-qunfei-a-chinese-billionaire-built-her-fortune.html?rref=technology |title=How a Chinese Billionaire Built Her Fortune |newspaper=New York Times |date=30 July 2015 |accessdate=1 August 2015 }}</ref><ref name=afr>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afr.com/leadership/entrepreneur/chinas-women-bring-in-the-billions-20151201-glcqw0|title=Zhou Qunfei is China's richest woman and she sleeps in her factory office|last=Murray|first=Lisa|date=4 December 2015|website=AFR Weekend|publisher=AFR Weekend|access-date=5 August 2015}}</ref><ref name=sina/>  The family owns a $27 million estate in Hong Kong.

Zhou Qunfei's rags-to-riches story has been hailed as an inspiration to the millions of migrant workers in China. In an interview with [[Gansu]] Television, she said the secret of her success was the desire to learn.<ref name=scmp/>
