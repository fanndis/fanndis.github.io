She moved corporate spending away from junk foods and into the healthier alternatives, with the aim of improving the healthiness of even the "fun" offerings.<ref name="jenniferreingold" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/indra-nooyi-on-making-pepsico-good-for-you/articleshow/62992920.cms|title=Indra Nooyi on making Pepsico 'good for you'|date=2018-02-20|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-02-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227034148/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/indra-nooyi-on-making-pepsico-good-for-you/articleshow/62992920.cms|archive-date=27 February 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2015, Nooyi removed [[aspartame]] from Diet Pepsi, furthering the shift towards healthier foods, despite lack of evidence of aspartame's harmful effects.<ref name=":0" />

As part of Performance with a Purpose, Nooyi also focused on environmental concerns and sustainability, redesigning packaging to reduce waste, conserving water, switching to [[renewable energy]] sources and recycling.

Nooyi has stated an intent to develop a line of snacks marketed specifically for women, feeling that it is a hitherto unexplored category.
