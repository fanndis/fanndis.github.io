In November 2018, ''The Washington Post'' reported that Trump shared her schedule with childcare providers—a form of official government business—through her personal email, a possible technical violation of federal records rules, which require communications to be sent within 20 days to a work account for permanent archival. A spokesman for Trump's ethics counsel stated that the improperly handled emails were sent before she was briefed on the rules: "Trump sometimes used her personal account, almost always for logistics and scheduling concerning her family", and that the emails did not have [[classified information]].
