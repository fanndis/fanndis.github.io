'''Nicola Ferguson Sturgeon''' (born 19 July 1970) is a Scottish politician serving as [[First Minister of Scotland]] and [[Leader of the Scottish National Party]] (SNP) since 2014. She is the [[List of First Ministers of Scotland|fifth person to be first minister]] and the first woman to hold either position. Sturgeon has been a [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) since 1999, first as an [[additional member system|additional member]] for the [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow electoral region]] from 1999 to 2007 and as the member for [[Glasgow Southside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Southside]] since 2007 (known as [[Glasgow Govan (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] from 2007 to 2011).

A law graduate of the [[University of Glasgow]], Sturgeon worked as a [[solicitor]] in [[Glasgow]]. After being elected to the Scottish Parliament, she served successively as the SNP's shadow minister for education, health, and justice. In 2004 she announced that she would stand as a candidate for the leadership of the SNP following the resignation of [[John Swinney]]. However, she later withdrew from the contest in favour of [[Alex Salmond]], standing instead as [[wikt:depute|depute]] (deputy)<!-- This is how the SNP spell that word: "depute". It is not a spelling error--> leader on a joint ticket with Salmond.

Both were subsequently elected, and as Salmond was still an MP in the House of Commons, Sturgeon led the SNP in the Scottish Parliament from 2004 to 2007. The SNP won the highest number of seats in the Scottish Parliament in [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|the 2007 election]] and Salmond was subsequently appointed First Minister. He appointed Sturgeon as [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland|Deputy First Minister]] and [[Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing]]. She was appointed as [[Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Investment and Cities]] in 2012. Following the defeat of the [[Yes Scotland]] campaign in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]], Salmond resigned and Sturgeon was [[2014 Scottish National Party leadership election|elected unopposed as SNP leader in November 2014]] and appointed as First Minister.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/alex-salmond-resignation-nicola-sturgeon-destiny|title=Alex Salmond's resignation could give Nicola Sturgeon her day of destiny|author=Libby Brooks|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 September 2014|access-date=19 November 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209154913/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/alex-salmond-resignation-nicola-sturgeon-destiny|archive-date=9 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-30011421|title=The transition from Alex Salmond to Nicola Sturgeon|first=Glenn|last=Campbell|work=BBC News|date=13 November 2014|access-date=19 November 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117032228/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-30011421|archive-date=17 November 2014}}</ref>

Sturgeon led the SNP through the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] when it enjoyed a surge in support, recording a number of swings of over 30% from Labour, as it won 56 of the 59 Scottish seats and replaced the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] as the third-largest party in the [[British House of Commons]]. In the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election|2016 election]], the [[Scottish Parliament]] was returned with a pro-independence majority with the SNP and the [[Scottish Greens]]. Although the SNP were two seats short of a majority, it was returned as the largest single party, with more than double the seats of the [[Scottish Conservatives]]; Sturgeon secured a second term as First Minister, forming an SNP [[minority government]]. In the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 UK referendum on EU membership]], Scotland voted by 62% to remain in the [[European Union]], despite [[Brexit]] receiving 52% of the vote across the UK.{{efn|In the [[Brexit referendum]], a majority of voters in every local authority area in Scotland voted to remain in 2016.}} After the vote to leave the EU, the Scottish Parliament authorised the [[Scottish Government]] to seek a section 30 order to hold a [[Proposed second Scottish independence referendum|second referendum on independence]].

Sturgeon grew up in [[Prestwick]] and [[Dreghorn]]. She attended Dreghorn Primary School from 1975 to 1982 and [[Greenwood Academy, Dreghorn|Greenwood Academy]] from 1982 to 1988. She later studied [[law]] at the [[University of Glasgow]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] (Hons) in 1992 and a [[Diploma in Legal Practice]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alba.org.uk/scot07constit/g04.html |title=Candidates and Constituency Assessments |publisher=Alba.org.uk |access-date=17 January 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606052650/http://www.alba.org.uk/scot07constit/g04.html |archive-date=6 June 2011 }}</ref> During her time at the University of Glasgow she was active as a member of the [[Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association]] and the [[Glasgow University Students' Representative Council]].

Following her graduation, Sturgeon completed her legal traineeship at McClure Naismith, a Glasgow firm of solicitors, in 1995. After qualifying as a [[solicitor]], she worked for Bell & Craig, a firm of solicitors in [[Stirling]], and later at the [[Drumchapel]] [[Law Centre]] in [[Glasgow]] from 1997 until her election to the [[Scottish Parliament]] in 1999.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-25333635|title=The Nicola Sturgeon story|last=Sim|first=Philip|date=26 May 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=21 November 2017|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915002848/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-25333635|archive-date=15 September 2017}}</ref>

==Early political years==
In an interview with the BBC's ''[[Woman's Hour]]'', Sturgeon revealed that it was [[Margaret Thatcher]] who inspired her to enter politics, because, due to rising unemployment in Scotland at the time, she developed "a strong feeling that it was wrong for Scotland to be governed by a Tory government that we hadn't elected".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-25333635|title=The Nicola Sturgeon story|last=Sim|first=Philip|date=26 May 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=14 September 2017|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915002848/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-25333635|archive-date=15 September 2017}}</ref>

Sturgeon joined the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) in 1986, having already become a member of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and quickly became the party's Youth Affairs Vice Convener and Publicity Vice Convener.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snp.org/media-centre/news/2014/apr/sturgeon-now-or-never-banish-trident|title=Sturgeon: "Now or never" to banish Trident|date=5 April 2014|access-date=6 July 2014|publisher=Scottish National Party|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708202748/http://www.snp.org/media-centre/news/2014/apr/sturgeon-now-or-never-banish-trident|archive-date=8 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.snp.org/nicola_sturgeon_fm |title=About: Nicola Sturgeon MSP |publisher=Scottish National Party |access-date=2 July 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715123308/http://www.snp.org/nicola_sturgeon_fm |archive-date=15 July 2016 }}</ref> She first stood for election in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] as the SNP candidate in the [[Glasgow Shettleston (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Shettleston]] constituency, and was the youngest parliamentary candidate in Scotland, failing to win the seat.

Sturgeon also stood unsuccessfully as the SNP candidate for the Irvine North [[Ward (electoral subdivision)|ward]] on [[Cunninghame]] District Council in May 1992, for the [[Baillieston]]/[[Mount Vernon, Glasgow|Mount Vernon]] ward on [[Strathclyde|Strathclyde Regional Council]] in 1994, and for the [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]] ward on [[Glasgow City Council]] in 1995.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In the mid-1990s Sturgeon and [[Charles Kennedy]] went together on a political study visit to Australia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-32975311|title=Sturgeon on Charles Kennedy 'a most talented politician'|work=BBC News|date=2 June 2015|access-date=4 June 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602110544/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-32975311|archive-date=2 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dathan|first1=Matt|title=Nicola Sturgeon reveals how she and Charles Kennedy watched Trainspotting together as she pays tribute to former Lib Dem leader|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicola-sturgeon-reveals-how-she-and-charles-kennedy-watched-trainspotting-together-as-she-pays-tribute-to-former-lib-dem-leader-10292645.html|website=independent.co.uk|date=2 June 2015|access-date=4 June 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603075431/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicola-sturgeon-reveals-how-she-and-charles-kennedy-watched-trainspotting-together-as-she-pays-tribute-to-former-lib-dem-leader-10292645.html|archive-date=3 June 2015}}</ref>

The [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] saw Sturgeon selected to fight the [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] seat for the SNP. Boundary changes meant that the notional [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] majority in the seat had increased substantially. However, infighting between the two rival candidates for the Labour nomination, [[Mohammad Sarwar (politician)|Mohammed Sarwar]] and [[Mike Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie|Mike Watson]], along with an energetic local campaign,{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} resulted in Glasgow Govan being the only Scottish seat to see a swing away from Labour in the midst of a Labour [[Landslide victory|landslide]] nationwide. Sarwar did, however, win the seat with a majority of 2,914 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/05/0505/stats.shtml|title=BBC Politics 97|access-date=19 November 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324034533/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/05/0505/stats.shtml|archive-date=24 March 2015}}</ref> Shortly after this, Sturgeon was appointed as the SNP's spokesperson for energy and education matters.

===Election to Scottish Parliament, 1999===

Sturgeon stood for election to the [[Scottish Parliament]] in the [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first Scottish Parliament election]] in 1999 as the SNP candidate for [[Glasgow Govan (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]].<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicola-Sturgeon|title=Nicola Sturgeon {{!}} Biography & Facts|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=21 November 2017|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008035648/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicola-Sturgeon|archive-date=8 October 2017}}</ref> Although she failed to win the seat, she was placed first in the SNP's regional list for the [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliamentary Electoral Area)|Glasgow region]], and was thus elected as a [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]]. During the first term of the Scottish Parliament, Sturgeon served as a member of the [[Shadow Cabinet]]s of both [[Alex Salmond]] and [[John Swinney]]. She was [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning|Shadow Minister for Children and Education]] from 1999 to 2000, [[Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing|Shadow Minister for Health and Community Care]] from 2000 to 2003, and [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice|Shadow Minister for Justice]] from 2003 to 2004.

Sturgeon confirmed in June 2016 that the Scottish government had formally agreed to draft legislation to allow a second independence referendum to take place.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36631738|title=EU referendum: The 'stark difference' between Wales and Scotland|work=BBC News|date=25 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628182427/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36631738|archive-date=28 June 2016}}</ref> As the constitution is a reserved matter under the [[Scotland Act 1998]], for a future referendum on Scottish independence to be legal under UK law, it would need to receive the consent of the British Parliament to take place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/contents|title=Scotland Act 1998|website=Legislation.gov.uk|access-date=25 June 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629003653/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/contents|archive-date=29 June 2016}}</ref>

Prior to the day the Prime Minister triggered [[Article 50]], formally allowing the process of the United Kingdom leaving the [[European Union]], the [[Scottish Parliament]] voted 69 to 59 in favour of another independence referendum.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/28/scottish-parliament-votes-for-second-independence-referendum-nicola-sturgeon|title=Scottish parliament votes for second independence referendum|last=editor|first=Severin Carrell Scotland|date=28 March 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=6 April 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406103856/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/28/scottish-parliament-votes-for-second-independence-referendum-nicola-sturgeon|archive-date=6 April 2017}}</ref> By the end of that week, on 30 March 2017, Sturgeon wrote to the Prime Minister requesting a Section 30 order, formally devolving the responsibility and power to the [[Scottish Government]] to plan for and hold another referendum on Scottish Independence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicola-sturgeon-scottish-independence-referendum-theresa-may-request-a7659201.html|title=Nicola Sturgeon writes letter to Theresa May requesting second Scottish independence referendum|last=Osborne|first=Samuel|date=31 March 2017|work=The Independent|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819061701/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicola-sturgeon-scottish-independence-referendum-theresa-may-request-a7659201.html|archive-date=19 August 2017}}</ref> Previously, May and [[David Mundell]], [[Secretary of State for Scotland]], have both highlighted that as the negotiations begin with the European Union on the United Kingdom's withdraw, it is important for Scotland to work with the UK Government to get the best exit deal for both the United Kingdom and Scotland, stating that "now is not the time for another referendum".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/theresa-may-now-is-not-the-time-for-indyref2-1-4393668|title=Theresa May: 'Now is not the time' for indyref2|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=6 April 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401061410/http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/theresa-may-now-is-not-the-time-for-indyref2-1-4393668|archive-date=1 April 2017}}</ref>

====European Union membership====
[[File:FM meets with Juncker.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Sturgeon meets [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], [[President of the European Commission]] in [[Brussels]], 2017]]
In response to the UK-wide vote for the United Kingdom to leave the [[European Union]], the [[Scottish Government]], headed by Sturgeon, launched the ''Scotland's Place in Europe'' document, a white paper setting out the Scottish Government's aims and wishes of Scotland's role in Europe post-Brexit. The paper was sent to the central [[British Government]] to be read by Prime Minister [[Theresa May]].

In June 2017, Sturgeon criticised the approaches taken by both [[Theresa May]] and the British Government towards the Brexit approach, claiming that May "will struggle" as she is a "difficult person to build a rapport with". In the same interview, Sturgeon committed to no independence referendum being held prior to the terms of a UK wide Brexit deal being agreed and presented.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/06/nicola-sturgeon-says-difficult-theresa-may-will-struggle-with-brexit-talks |title=Nicola Sturgeon says 'difficult' Theresa May will struggle with Brexit talks |access-date=8 July 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714061853/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/06/nicola-sturgeon-says-difficult-theresa-may-will-struggle-with-brexit-talks |archive-date=14 July 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=6 June 2017 |last1=Asthana |first1=Anushka |last2=Carrell |first2=Severin }}</ref>

With a view towards Brexit, Sturgeon demanded greater powers for the Scottish Parliament, arguing that Brexit is threatening Scotland's [[Scottish devolution settlement|devolution settlement]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/nicola-sturgeon-calls-for-united-front-to-protect-devolution-1-4556755|title=Nicola Sturgeon calls for united front to protect devolution|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=14 September 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912131031/http://www.scotsman.com/news/nicola-sturgeon-calls-for-united-front-to-protect-devolution-1-4556755|archive-date=12 September 2017}}</ref> With London seeking to restrict immigration to the United Kingdom, she asserted that Scotland should be able to set its own immigration policy, as well as policies relating to employment and trade.<ref name=":0" />

====Scottish local elections, 2017====
{{Main|Scottish local elections, 2017}}
Sturgeon and the SNP went into the Scottish council elections that were held on 4 May 2017, as the largest political party in the 32 local council areas in Scotland, having 424 councillors elected to serve on the councils across Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/vote2012/council/scotland.stm|title=BBC News – Vote 2012 – Scottish Council Results|website=BBC News|access-date=28 June 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506180240/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/vote2012/council/scotland.stm|archive-date=6 May 2017}}</ref> Publicly speaking about the 2017 Scottish council elections, Sturgeon has said that the elections were a clear choice between voting for herself and [[Ruth Davidson]], the leader of the [[Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party]], citing the stark fall in support of the [[Scottish Labour Party]] and their leader [[Kezia Dugdale]] over the past several years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/15237638.Sturgeon__Council_elections_a_choice_between_SNP_and_Tories/|title=Sturgeon: Council elections a choice between SNP and Tories|website=HeraldScotland|access-date=28 June 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430030051/http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/15237638.Sturgeon__Council_elections_a_choice_between_SNP_and_Tories/|archive-date=30 April 2017}}</ref>

While failing to win any outright overall control in any council area in Scotland, the SNP emerged as the largest political group in sixteen councils, including [[Glasgow City Council|Glasgow]], [[City of Edinburgh Council|Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen City Council|Aberdeen]] for the first time. However, on a notional basis, the SNP suffered a net loss of 7 councillors compared to 2012.

The SNP lost 21 seats in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election in Scotland]] amid a swing to the Scottish Conservatives of 13.7%, although remained the biggest party in Scotland. Sturgeon admitted that these results were "bitterly disappointing" and acknowledged that her party's plans for a second referendum were 'undoubtedly' a factor in the election results.<ref>{{Cite news|date=9 June 2017|title=Sturgeon: Indyref2 'factor' in SNP losses|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40216748|access-date=1 September 2020}}</ref>

====Alex Salmond sexual harassment case====
In January 2019, Sturgeon referred herself to an independent ministerial ethics body, which will lead to an investigation into her actions with respect to a [[Alex Salmond#Resignation from the SNP and allegations of sexual misconduct|sexual harassment case concerning allegations against Salmond]]. This followed her admitting that she had a secret meeting and subsequent phone call with Salmond about the Scottish government's allegations against him. She raised these with the Permanent Secretary to the [[Scottish Government]], [[Leslie Evans]], two months later, rather than reporting them immediately, as she should if they constitute government matters (as per the ministerial code). Sturgeon argued that the meetings were SNP party matters, and thus not covered. The investigating panel will consist of Dame [[Elish Angiolini]], a former [[Solicitor General for Scotland]] and [[lord advocate]], and [[James Hamilton (Director of Public Prosecutions)|James Hamilton]], a former [[Director of Public Prosecutions (Ireland)|director of public prosecutions]] in the Republic of Ireland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jan/13/nicola-sturgeon-refers-herself-ethics-body-salmond-case|title=Sturgeon refers herself to ethics body over actions in Salmond case|first=Severin Carrell Scotland|last=editor|date=13 January 2019|via=www.theguardian.com|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> On 15 January 2019 the [[Scottish Parliament]] agreed to hold its own inquiry into the matter.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46876847|title=MSPs to hold inquiry over Salmond row|date=15 January 2019|access-date=15 January 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>
