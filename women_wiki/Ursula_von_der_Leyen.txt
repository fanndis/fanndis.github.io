She served in the [[Government of Germany|federal government]] of Germany from 2005 to 2019, as the Federal Minister of Defence, in [[Angela Merkel]]'s Cabinet. She is a member of the centre-right [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) and its EU counterpart, the [[European People's Party]] (EPP).

Born and raised in [[Brussels]] to German parents; her father [[Ernst Albrecht (politician, born 1930)|Ernst Albrecht]] was one of the first [[European Civil Service|European civil servants]]. She was brought up bilingually in German and French. She moved to [[Hanover]] in 1971, when her father entered politics to become [[Minister President of Lower Saxony|Minister President]] of the state of [[Lower Saxony]] in 1976. As an economics student at the [[London School of Economics]] in the late 1970s, she lived under the name Rose [[Ladson family|Ladson]], the family name of her American great-grandmother from [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. After graduating as a physician from the [[Hannover Medical School]] in 1987, she specialized in [[women's health]].

In 2005, she joined the federal cabinet, first as [[Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth|Minister of Family Affairs and Youth]] from 2005 to 2009, then as [[Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (Germany)|Minister of Labour and Social Affairs]] from 2009 to 2013, and finally as [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence]] from 2013 to 2019, the first woman to serve as German defence minister.<ref name="businessweek.com">Arne Delfs (22 January 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-22/merkel-succession-beckons-after-von-der-leyen-s-defense-posting "Merkel Succession Beckons After Von der Leyen’s Defence Posting"], ''[[Businessweek]]''.</ref> When she left office she was the only minister to have served continuously in [[Angela Merkel]]'s cabinet since Merkel became Chancellor.

==Family and early life==
{{Main|Albrecht family}}
Von der Leyen was born in 1958 in [[Ixelles]], Brussels, Belgium, where she lived until she was 13 years old. In the family, she has been known since childhood as Röschen, a diminutive of [[Rose (given name)|Rose]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/niedersachsen/Ursula-von-der-Leyen-eine-Karriere,ursulavonderleyen110.html|title=Ursula von der Leyen: eine Karriere|website=www.ndr.de}}</ref> Her father [[Ernst Albrecht (politician, born 1930)|Ernst Albrecht]] worked as one of the first [[European Civil Service|European civil servants]] from the establishment of the [[European Commission]] in 1958, first as the [[Chef de Cabinet]] to the European Commissioner for Competition [[Hans von der Groeben]] in the [[Hallstein Commission]], and then as the Director-General of the [[Directorate-General for Competition]] from 1967 to 1970. She attended the [[European School, Brussels I]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Barker |first1=Alex |last2=Peel |first2=Michael |last3=Jones |first3=Claire |last4=Mount |first4=Ian |last5=Roberts |first5=Hannah |title=Christine Lagarde and Ursula von der Leyen: meet the EU's next leaders |url=https://www.ft.com/content/fdfbf65c-9370-11e9-b7ea-60e35ef678d2 |access-date=2 July 2019 |work=Financial Times |date=2 July 2019}}</ref>

In 1971, she relocated to [[Lehrte]] in the [[Hanover (district)|Hanover]] region after her father had become CEO of the food company [[Bahlsen]] and involved in state politics in Lower Saxony.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whoswho.de/bio/ursula-von-der-leyen.html|title=Ursula von der Leyen – Biografie WHO'S WHO|website=www.whoswho.de}}</ref> Her father served as [[Minister President of Lower Saxony]] (state prime minister) from 1976 to 1990, being re-elected in state parliament elections in 1978, 1982 and 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ursula-von-der-leyen-is-this-the-next-woman-to-become-chancellor-of-germany-9006358.html|title=Ursula von der Leyen: Is this the next woman to become Chancellor of|date=15 December 2013|website=The Independent}}</ref> In 1980 he ran for the CDU nomination for the [[Chancellor of Germany|German chancellorship]], backed by CDU chairman [[Helmut Kohl]], but narrowly missed the candidacy to fellow conservative [[Franz-Josef Strauß]] (who then lost the general election to the sitting chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]]); in the 1990 state elections Ernst Albrecht lost his office to [[Gerhard Schröder]], who later became German Chancellor.

Most of her ancestors were from the former states of [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] and [[Bremen]] in today's northwestern Germany; she has one American great-grandmother of primarily British descent, with more distant French and Italian ancestors, and some ancestors from what is now the [[Baltic states]], then in [[Imperial Russia]]. The [[Albrecht family]] was among the ''[[Hübsche families|hübsche]]'' ("courtly" or "genteel") families of the [[Electorate of Hanover|Electorate]] and [[Kingdom of Hanover]]—a state that was in a [[personal union]] with the [[United Kingdom]]—and her ancestors had been doctors, jurists and civil servants since the 17th century. Her great-great-grandfather [[George Alexander Albrecht (businessman)|George Alexander Albrecht]] moved to [[Bremen]] in the 19th century, where he became a wealthy cotton merchant, part of the [[Hanseaten (class)|Hanseatic]] elite and the Austro-Hungarian Consul from 1895. He married Louise Knoop, a daughter of Baron [[Ludwig Knoop]], one of the most successful entrepreneurs of the 19th century [[Russian Empire]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/regional/bremen/aktuell/2009/09/19/knoop-mausoleum/fuer-90000-euro-restauriert.html |title=Der denkmalgeschützte Bau drohte zu verfallen: Altes Knoop-Mausoleum für 90000 Euro restauriert |language=de |newspaper =Bild|access-date=1 December 2011}}</ref>

Von der Leyen's father's grandparents were the cotton merchant [[Carl Albrecht (businessman)|Carl Albrecht]] (1875–1952) and Mary [[Ladson family|Ladson]] Robertson (1883–1960), an American who belonged to a plantation owning family of the [[southern aristocracy]] from [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Her American ancestors played a significant role in the [[British colonization of the Americas]], and she descends from many of the first English settlers of [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]], [[Virginia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Barbados]], and from numerous colonial-era governors. Among her ancestors were Carolina governors [[John Yeamans]], [[James Moore (governor)|James Moore]], [[Robert Gibbes]], [[Thomas Smith (governor of South Carolina)|Thomas Smith]] and [[Joseph Blake (governor)|Joseph Blake]], Pennsylvania deputy governor [[Samuel Carpenter]], and the American revolutionary and lieutenant governor of South Carolina [[James Ladson]].<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XDYRAQAAMAAJ Register of the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the State of South Carolina]'', p. 35, The Society, 1945</ref><ref>"Albrecht," in ''[[Deutsches Geschlechterbuch]]'', Vol. 17, Görlitz 1910.</ref><ref>Arthur Meredyth Burke, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-78JbUTUewC&pg=PA458 The Prominent Families of the United States of America]''</ref> The [[Ladson family]] were large plantation owners and her ancestor [[James H.

In 2003, Von der Leyen was part of a group assigned by then-opposition leader and CDU chairwoman [[Angela Merkel]] to draft alternative proposals for social welfare reform in response to Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s "[[Agenda 2010]]". The so-called Herzog Commission, named after its chairman, the former [[President of Germany|German President]] [[Roman Herzog]], recommended a comprehensive package of reform proposals including, among other things, decoupling health and nursing care premiums from people's earnings and levying a monthly lump sum across the board instead.<ref>[http://www.dw.de/german-opposition-split-over-reforms/a-988212 "German Opposition Split Over Reforms"], ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 8 October 2003.</ref>

In November 2010, Von der Leyen was elected (with 85% of the votes) as one of four deputies of CDU chairwoman Angela Merkel, serving alongside [[Volker Bouffier]], [[Norbert Röttgen]] and [[Annette Schavan]].

=====International crises=====
Within her first year in office, Von der Leyen visited the [[Bundeswehr]] troops stationed in [[Afghanistan]] three times and oversaw the gradual withdrawal of German soldiers from the country as [[NATO]] was winding down its 13-year [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|combat mission]] [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]].<ref>[http://www.dw.de/german-defence-minister-makes-surprise-afghanistan-visit/a-18126693 "German defence minister makes surprise Afghanistan visit"], ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 13 December 2014.</ref> In summer 2014, she was instrumental in Germany's decision to resupply the Kurdish [[Peshmerga]] fighters with lethal assistance.<ref>Derek Chollet (25 March 2015), [http://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2015/03/meet-europes-rising-defense-stars/108379/Meet Europe’s Rising Defence Stars]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Atlantic Media|Defence One]]''.</ref> In September 2015, she signalled that she was open to delaying the withdrawal of 850 German soldiers from Afghanistan beyond 2016 after the [[Taliban]]'s surprise seizure of the northern city of [[Kunduz]].

Following criticism from German officials of [[President of Turkey|Turkish President]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]'s escalation of the [[Kurdish–Turkish conflict (2015–present)|Kurdish–Turkish conflict]] in August 2015, Von der Leyen decided to let Germany's three-year [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot missile batteries]] mission to southern Turkey lapse in January 2016 instead of seeking parliamentary approval to extend it. That same month, she participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the governments of Germany and [[Turkey]] in Berlin.<ref>[https://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Pressemitteilungen/BPA/2016/01/2015-01-15-deu-tuerk-regierungskonsultationen-breg.html Erste Deutsch-Türkische Regierungskonsultationen in Berlin] [[Cabinet of Germany|Federal Government of Germany]], press release of 15 January 2016.</ref> By April 2016, under Von der Leyen's leadership, the [[Bundeswehr|German Federal Armed Forces]] announced they would commit 65 million Euro to establish a permanent presence at [[Incirlik Air Base]], as part of Germany's commitment to the [[Military intervention against ISIL order of battle|military intervention against ISIL]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jennings|first1=Gareth|title=Germany to set up permanent facilities at Incirlik|journal=IHS Jane's Defence Weekly|date=4 May 2016|volume=53|issue=18|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Gebauer |first1=Matthias |title=Kampf gegen IS: Bundeswehr baut "Tornado"-Stützpunkt in der Türkei |trans-title=Fight against IS: Bundeswehr builds "Tornado" base in Turkey |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/kampf-gegen-is-bundeswehr-startet-tornado-basis-in-der-tuerkei-a-1089047.html |date=25 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426164714/http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/kampf-gegen-is-bundeswehr-startet-tornado-basis-in-der-tuerkei-a-1089047.html |archive-date=26 April 2016 |newspaper=[[Spiegel Online]] |language=de |access-date=9 February 2019}}</ref><ref>Andrea Shalal and Tulay Karadeniz (13 June 2016), [https://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-germany-security-idUSL8N1952XA Germany, Turkey to finalize deal on Incirlik base work in weeks-spokesman] ''[[Reuters]]''.</ref>

At the [[Munich Security Conference]] in 2015, Von der Leyen publicly defended the German refusal to supply Ukraine with weapons. Stressing that it was necessary to remain united in Europe over Ukraine, she argued that negotiations with Russia, unlike with the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] jihadists, were possible. Germany sees Ukraine and Russia as a chance to prove that in the 21st century, developed nations should solve disputes at the negotiating table, not with weapons, she said. She also noted that Russia has an almost infinite supply of weapons it could send into Ukraine. She questioned whether any effort by the West could match that or, more importantly, achieve the outcome sought by Ukraine and its supporters.<ref>David M.

On the contrary, Von der Leyen said that giving the Ukrainians arms to help them defend themselves could have unintended and fateful consequences. "Weapons deliveries would be a fire accelerant," Von der Leyen was quoted as telling the ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' daily. "And it could give the Kremlin the excuse to openly intervene in this conflict."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/02/05/world/europe/ap-eu-nato-ukraine-russia.html Top NATO General Warns of Russian Reaction to Arming Ukraine] ''[[New York Times]]'', 5 February 2015.</ref>

After [[Hungary]] used a water cannon and tear gas to drive asylum seekers back from the [[Hungarian border barrier|Hungarian-Serbian]] border on September 2015, during the [[European migrant crisis]], Von der Leyen publicly criticized the government of Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]] and called the measures "not acceptable and [...] against the European rules that we have."<ref>Laurens Cerulus (16 September 2015), [http://www.politico.eu/article/germany-hungary-migration-handling-pushback-human-rights-von-der-leyen/ Germany says Hungary’s use of tear gas is ‘not acceptable’] ''[[Politico Europe]]''</ref>

Under Von der Leyen's leadership, the German parliament approved government plans in early 2016 to send up to 650 soldiers to [[Mali]], boosting its presence in the U.N.

Following her nomination as a candidate for Commission President, the Commission provided her with a salary, office, and staff in Brussels to facilitate negotiations between the EU institutions as to her election.

==Political views==

===Childcare and parental leave===
Ursula von der Leyen assumed her office as [[Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth|Federal Minister for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth]] in 2005. Amidst protest, particularly from the conservative wing of her party, the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]], she introduced the {{ill|Child Advancement Act|de|Kinderförderungsgesetz}} (''Kinderförderungsgesetz''), which reserved 4.3 billion euros for the creation of childcare structures throughout Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.familien-wegweiser.de/BMFSFJ/Presse/pressemitteilungen,did=109896.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323072346/http://www.familien-wegweiser.de/BMFSFJ/Presse/pressemitteilungen,did=109896.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 March 2010|title=BMFSFJ – Pressemitteilungen – Ursula von der Leyen: "Der Weg zum Ausbau der Kinderbetreuung ist frei"|date=23 March 2010}}</ref>

Von der Leyen also introduced the German ''Elternzeit'', a paid [[parental leave]] scheme. Following Scandinavian models, the scheme reserves two additional months for fathers who go on parental leave as well (''Vätermonate'' in German). This part of the law, in particular, attracted protest from some German conservatives. [[Catholic]] [[Bishop]] [[Walter Mixa]] accused Von der Leyen of turning women into "birthing machines". Meanwhile, [[Bavaria]]n colleagues from Von der Leyen's sister party, the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]], complained that men did not need a "diaper-changing internship".<ref>{{cite pressrelease|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/18/world/europe/18iht-womenside.html?scp=1&sq=von%20der%20leyen&st=cse |title=Full portrait of von der Leyen's work |publisher=New York Times}}</ref> Von der Leyen successfully influenced public opinion of her reforms with a 3-million-euro PR campaign, which was criticized for using public funds for political advocacy and for employing [[embedded marketing]] techniques.<ref>[http://www.swr.de/report/-/id=233454/nid=233454/did=2478132/18nebdd/index.html Getarnte Werbung – Die fragwürdigen PR-Kampagnen der Bundesregierung] ("Stealth advertising – The questionable PR campaigns of the federal government").

In a 2011 interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', Von der Leyen expressed her preference for "a [[United States of Europe|united states of Europe]] – run along the lines of the federal states of Switzerland, Germany or the USA" which would capitalize on Europe's size by agreeing on core issues relating to finance, tax and economic politics.<ref>{{cite news|author=Helen Pidd |date= 12 March 2014 | url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/09/ursula-von-der-leyen-germany | title = Ursula von der Leyen: Germany's next chancellor? |newspaper = [[The Guardian]]}}</ref>

With 2014 marking the centenary of the start of [[World War I]], Von der Leyen – in her capacity as defence minister – inaugurated a memorial for the [[Armistice Day]] in [[Ablain-Saint-Nazaire]] alongside French President [[François Hollande]] and North Rhine-Westphalia State Premier [[Hannelore Kraft]], as well as British and Belgian officials.<ref>Natalie Muller (11 November 2014), [http://www.dw.de/hollande-von-der-leyen-europe-observe-armistice-day/a-18057098 Hollande, von der Leyen, Europe observe Armistice Day]''[[Deutsche Welle]]''.</ref>

In 2015, Von der Leyen argued that a form of EU army should be a long-term goal. She also said that she was convinced about the goal of a combined military force, just as she was convinced that "perhaps not my children, but then my grandchildren will experience a [[United States of Europe]]".<ref>[http://www.dw.de/juncker-calls-for-collective-eu-army/a-18302459 "Juncker calls for collective EU army"], ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 8 March 2015.</ref> In March 2015, she and her counterparts from [[France]] and [[Poland]], [[Jean-Yves Le Drian]] and [[Tomasz Siemoniak]], revived a meeting format intended to promote co-operation between the three countries in crisis zones by holding their first meeting between the [[Weimar Triangle]] defence ministers since 2007.<ref>[http://www.thenews.pl/1/10/Artykul/201980,MoD-Siemoniak-EU-needs-new-security-strategy MoD Siemoniak: EU needs new security strategy] ''[[Polskie Radio]]'', 31 March 2015.</ref>

Following the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union membership referendum]] in the United Kingdom, she argued that the UK had "paralysed" European efforts to integrate security policy and "consistently blocked everything with the label 'Europe' on it."<ref>Stefan Wagstyl (13 July 2016), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8b97923c-490a-11e6-8d68-72e9211e86ab.html Germany calls for more joint European military initiatives] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref> She has described [[Brexit]] as "a burst bubble of hollow promises."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/02/eu-leaders-pick-women-rule-brussels-first-time/|title=EU picks Ursula von der Leyen – who called Brexit 'a burst bubble of hollow promises' – to be first woman to rule Brussels|first=James|last=Crisp|date=2 July 2019|via=www.telegraph.co.uk|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref> In an interview with The Guardian days after her election to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as [[President of the European Commission]], she stated that the withdrawal deal agreed between [[Theresa May]] and chief Brexit negotiator [[Michel Barnier]] would remain the basis of any future talks.

===Same-sex marriage===
When the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] ruled in favour of tax equality to same-sex couples in 2013, Von der Leyen came forward in support of [[LGBT adoption|equal adoption rights]], arguing that "I know of no study that says that children growing up in same-sex partnerships fare any differently than children who grow up in heterosexual marriages or partnerships."<ref>Melanie Amann, Dietmar Hipp and Peter Müller (11 June 2013), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/gay-adoption-debate-flusters-german-conservatives-a-904875.html Vater and Vater: Gay Adoption Debate Flusters Conservatives] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.</ref> In June 2017, Von der Leyen voted against her parliamentary group’s majority and in favour of Germany's introduction of [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Germany|same-sex marriage]].<ref>Carsten Wagner (30 June 2017), [http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/niedersachsen/Ehe-fuer-alle-Niedersachsen-CDU-uneins-in-Berlin,ehefueralle136.html "Ehe für alle": Niedersachsen-CDU uneins in Berlin] ''[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]]''.</ref>
