====Ties to Goldman Sachs====
[[Goldman Sachs]], whose executives donated $100,000 to the Whitman campaign, manages a part of Whitman's fortune. As CEO of eBay, Whitman earned approximately $1.78&nbsp;million resulting from a practice known as [[spinning (IPO)|spinning]] whereby executives who did business with Goldman Sachs could reap profits by getting early deals before the public on hot [[Initial public offering|IPOs]] offered by the bank. Whitman later resigned from the Goldman Sachs board after some expressed concern over her receiving shares from Goldman Sachs. In commenting on Whitman's resignation from the Goldman Sachs board, eBay spokesman Henry Gomez told ''The Wall Street Journal'' at the time that, "If we wanted to use Goldman's services, she doesn't want there to be even the slightest perception of any conflict. She's doing this because she thinks quite highly of the firm."<ref>{{cite web|title=EBay CEO quits Goldman board|url=https://money.cnn.com/2002/12/20/news/whitman/|publisher=CNN Money|access-date=August 7, 2014|date=December 20, 2002}}</ref>  While Whitman was on Goldman Sachs' board, she served on the compensation committee, which approved multimillion-dollar bonus packages for then-CEO [[Henry Paulson]] and his top aides. Public domain documents reveal that Whitman has a multimillion-dollar stake in 21 investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs.<ref name="Lance Williams and Carla Marinucci"/> Given Goldman Sachs' major investments in California state finances, all these ties to Goldman Sachs led to considerable controversy during the gubernatorial campaign.<ref name="Lance Williams and Carla Marinucci"/> In response, Whitman vowed to eliminate any potential conflicts of interest, and publicly stated that she would immediately sell her Goldman Sachs stock and put her Goldman Sachs-managed investments in a [[blind trust]] if elected governor.

==Political positions==
While running for governor, Whitman emphasized three major areas: job creation, reduced state government spending, and reform of the state's K-12 educational system. She argued that it is best to start only a few things and finish them, instead of starting a lot of things and finishing few of them.<ref name=McLaughlin-20091116>{{cite news|author=McLaughlin, Ken|title=Campbell takes Silicon Valley in new San Jose State poll|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/california-governors-race-2010/ci_13802741|work=San Jose Mercury News|date=November 16, 2009|access-date=December 26, 2009}}</ref>

On water issues, Whitman opposed further restrictions on water supply in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], and she suggested that President Obama should overturn a federal judge's ruling under provisions in the [[Endangered Species Act]] which reduced water supplies another 5% to 7%.<ref>[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100820032423/http://www.megwhitman.com/story/202/meg-whitman-let-the-water-flow.html "Meg Whitman: Let the water flow"]. ''Fresno Bee''. June 12, 2009</ref>

===Illegal immigration===
Whitman said that [[Arizona]]'s approach to illegal immigration with [[Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act|Arizona SB 1070]] is wrong and that there are better ways to solve the problem.<ref>{{Cite news| url =https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/10/whitman-in-spanish-im-against-arizonas-law/65236/|title=Whitman in Spanish: I'm Against Arizona's Law|first=Chris |last=Good|publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date =October 26, 2010}}</ref> She said that, if she had lived in California in 1994, she would have voted against [[California Proposition 187 (1994)|Proposition 187]] concerning illegal immigrants.<ref name="Dibble">

===Marriage, abortion and marijuana===
During the 2010 California gubernatorial election, Whitman supported California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], which reversed ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]'' and defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman in the state. Whitman also criticized Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and [[California Attorney General|Attorney General]] Jerry Brown for not defending Proposition 8 in the federal judicial system.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Marinucci, Carla |author2=Garofoli, Joe |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/08/20/MNKU1F18TF.DTL |title=Meg Whitman says state should defend Prop. 8 |work=San Francisco Chronicle  |date=August 21, 2010 |access-date=August 29, 2010}}</ref> However, on February 26, 2013, Whitman confirmed that she had reversed that opinion.

===Infrastructure===
Whitman does not support the [[California High-Speed Rail]] project. In a 2010 letter to the ''[[Sacramento Bee]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2010/07/09/2878527/the-buzz-atherton-resident-meg.html |title=The Buzz: Atherton resident Meg Whitman not too keen on bullet train |work=Sacramento Bee |access-date=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719210211/http://www.sacbee.com/2010/07/09/2878527/the-buzz-atherton-resident-meg.html |archive-date=July 19, 2010 }}</ref> Whitman's spokeswoman Sarah Pompei said, "Meg believes the state cannot afford the costs associated with high-speed rail due to our current fiscal crisis." Her opponent Jerry Brown is in favor of the project.

Whitman has made monetary donations to various candidates and [[political action committee]]s (PAC). While these have gone to both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], the donations are weighted to Republicans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmeat.com/ceo_political_donations/Meg_Whitman.php|title=Meg Whitman at|publisher=Newsmeat.com|date=May 19, 2010|access-date=May 27, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205142144/http://newsmeat.com/ceo_political_donations/Meg_Whitman.php|archive-date=February 5, 2010}}</ref> Though Whitman has contributed to a few Democrats, including Senator [[Barbara Boxer]]; donating $4,000 to her campaign and serving on the "Friends of Boxer" committee in 2004, she donated more than $225,000 during the same period to Republicans, eBay's PAC and to Americans for a Republican Majority, the PAC of former [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Tom DeLay]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Weigel|first=David|url=http://washingtonindependent.com/62382/meg-whitmans-donations-barbara-boxer-tom-delay|title=Washingtonindependent.com|publisher=Washingtonindependent.com|access-date=May 27, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525004150/http://washingtonindependent.com/62382/meg-whitmans-donations-barbara-boxer-tom-delay|archive-date=May 25, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Marinucci|first=Carla|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=48814#ixzz0Wx4GvMLs|title=''San Francisco Chronicle''|work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=October 2, 2009|access-date=May 27, 2010}}</ref>
