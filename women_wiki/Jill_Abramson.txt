==Career==
While a [[Harvard College|Harvard]] undergraduate, she was the Arts Editor of ''[[The Harvard Independent]]'', and worked at ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine from 1973 to 1976. Subsequently, she spent nearly a decade as a senior staff reporter for ''[[The American Lawyer]]''.<ref name="nytco">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytco.com/company/executives/Jill_Abramson.html|title=Jill Abramson|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] Official Website|accessdate=October 29, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025234956/http://www.nytco.com/company/executives/Jill_Abramson.html|archive-date=October 25, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 1986, she was appointed as editor in chief of ''[[Legal Times]]'' in Washington, D.C., serving for two years.

Abramson was the ''Times''' Washington Bureau chief during the turbulent period of Spring 2003 during the run-up to the war in Iraq and the [[Jayson Blair]] scandal, which led to the resignation of Executive Editor [[Howell Raines]] and Managing Editor [[Gerald M. Boyd|Gerald Boyd]]. In a February 2013 interview, Abramson spoke of the conflict she had with Raines as D.C. bureau chief, saying, "Howell from the get-go just had no use for me.  ... I did think about quitting."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/media/story/2013/02/times-editor-jill-abramson-opens-up-about-layoffs-the-time-she-almost-quit-and-loneliness-at-the-top-001060|title=Times Editor Jill Abramson Opens Up About Layoffs, the Time She Almost Quit and Loneliness at the Top|last=Pompeo|first=Joe|date=February 20, 2013|accessdate=May 21, 2017|work=Capital NY}}</ref> Abramson was named to the news managing editor position (with co-Managing Editor [[John M.

In 1995, Abramson and her ''The Wall Street Journal'' colleague (and fellow [[Ethical Culture Fieldston School|Fieldston]] alumna) [[Jane Mayer]] co-authored ''Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas'', which detailed circumstances surrounding the confirmation hearings of Justice [[Clarence Thomas]]. [[Maureen Dowd]] would later write of having bonded with Abramson during that time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Maureen|first=Dowd|author-link=Maureen Dowd|title=Are Men Necessary?

In February 2007, Abramson testified in the [[perjury]] [[trial (law)|trial]] of [[Scooter Libby]], ''[[United States v. Libby]]''. She was called as a defense witness to undercut the credibility of [[Judith Miller]].<ref name="Adweek"/>

In 2010, Abramson worked on news content on the ''Times''{{'}} website for six months.<ref name="Adweek"/>

On June 2, 2011, Abramson became the executive editor of the ''Times,'' replacing Bill Keller who stepped down from the position to become a full-time writer.<ref name="NYT_20110603">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/03/business/media/03paper.html|title=Abramson to Replace Keller as The Times's Executive Editor|last=Peters|first=Jeremy W.|work=The New York Times|date=June 2, 2011|accessdate=June 2, 2011}}</ref>

Abramson was scheduled to address the commencement exercises of [[Barnard College]] on May 14, 2012. Her speech was canceled after President [[Barack Obama]] requested to speak instead.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/213955-obama-asks-to-give-commencement-address-at-ny-womens-college|title=Obama asks to deliver commencement speech at New York women's college|last=Parness|first=Amie|work=The Hill|date=March 3, 2012|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}</ref> She received an honorary degree at [[Fairleigh Dickinson]]'s 69th Commencement Ceremony in May 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fairleigh Dickinson University Holds 69th Commencement on May 15|url=http://inside.fdu.edu/prpt/commencement_2012.html|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref>

In April 2013, Abramson was the subject of a sharply critical profile in ''[[Politico]]'' written by [[Dylan Byers]] entitled "Turbulence at the Times," in which anonymous ''Times'' staffers called her "impossible" and "very, very unpopular." Abramson was deeply distressed by the report, later saying it made her cry.<ref name="politico-nymag">{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/07/politico-made-jill-abramson-cry.html|title=Politico Made Jill Abramson Cry|last=Coscarelli|first=Joe|work=New York magazine|date=July 31, 2013|accessdate=September 5, 2015}}</ref>

On May 14, 2014, Abramson was fired from her position as executive editor of the ''Times'', and [[Dean Baquet]] succeeded her in that role.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/business/media/after-firing-from-times-jill-abramson-talks-about-resilience.html|title=In First Public Remarks After Firing, Jill Abramson Talks of Resilience|work=The New York Times|author=Ravi Somaiya|date=May 19, 2014|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> Abramson was reportedly fired because of "her arbitrary decision-making, a failure to consult and bring colleagues with her, inadequate communication, and mistreatment of colleagues".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-bosses-how-tough-is-too-tough-1400803624|title=Is the Hard-Nosed Boss Obsolete?|work=The Wall Street Journal|author=M.

During the run-up to the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 U.S. presidential election]], Abramson argued in a column for ''[[Guardian US]]'' that [[Hillary Clinton]], whom she had covered as a reporter and editor since the [[Whitewater controversy]], was "fundamentally honest and trustworthy."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson|title=This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest|date=March 28, 2016|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}</ref>

On February 19, 2018, Abramson followed up her 1995 book on [[Clarence Thomas]] and the [[Anita Hill]] hearings with a discussion concerning new evidence that Thomas had committed perjury which might be tied to possible impeachment.<ref name="Abramson_2018-02-19">Jill Abramson.

In February 2019, [[Vice News]] correspondent [[Michael C.

==Personal life==
In 1981, she married Harvard classmate Henry Little Griggs III. Griggs was then president of Triad, a political public relations company. He is self-described as a "writer, editor and media-relations consultant specializing in nonprofit advocacy campaigns." They have two children.<ref name="Adweek"/>

In May 2007, Abramson was seriously injured in a [[truck]]-[[pedestrian]] crash near the ''New York Times''{{'s}} [[The New York Times Building|headquarters]] in [[Times Square]]. She subsequently filed a lawsuit against the truck's driver, owner, and operator, who was involved in the crash, as well two companies involved in the crash.<ref name="Adweek"/>

Abramson has four tattoos on her body that she describes as "telling the story of me."
