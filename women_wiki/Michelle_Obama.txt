'''Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama''' (''[[née]]'' '''Robinson'''; January 17, 1964) is an American attorney and author who was the [[First Lady of the United States]] from 2009 to 2017. She is married to the [[List of Presidents of the United States|44th]] [[president of the United States]], [[Barack Obama]], and was the [[List of African-American firsts|first African-American]] First Lady.

Raised on the [[South Side of Chicago]], Illinois, Obama is a graduate of [[Princeton University]] and [[Harvard Law School]]. In her early legal career, she worked at the law firm [[Sidley Austin]] where she met Barack Obama. She subsequently worked in non-profits and as the associate dean of Student Services at the [[University of Chicago]] as well as the vice president for Community and External Affairs of the [[University of Chicago Medical Center]]. Michelle married Barack in 1992, and they have two daughters.

Obama campaigned for her [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|husband's presidential bid]] throughout 2007 and 2008, delivering a keynote address at the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]]. She has subsequently delivered acclaimed speeches at the [[2012 Democratic National Convention|2012]], [[2016 Democratic National Convention|2016]], and [[2020 Democratic National Convention|2020]] conventions.

As first lady, Obama served as a role model for women and worked as an advocate for poverty awareness, education, nutrition, physical activity, and healthy eating. She supported American designers and was considered a fashion icon.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/shopping/chi-michelle-obama-1112_qnov12,0,5421281.story|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|title=Michelle Obama emerges as an American fashion icon|access-date=June 4, 2011|first=Wendy|last=Donahue}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/10/michelle-obama-settling-in-as-a-role-model/|first=Christina|last= Bellantoni |title=Michelle Obama settling in as a role model|work=[[The Washington Times]]|date=April 10, 2009|access-date=June 4, 2011}}</ref>

The Obama family lived on Chicago's South Side, where Barack taught at the University of Chicago Law School. He was elected to the state senate in 1996, and to the US Senate in 2004. They chose to keep their residence in Chicago after Barack's election rather than to move to Washington, DC, as they felt it was better for their daughters.

Michelle Obama was raised [[United Methodist]] and joined the [[Trinity United Church of Christ]], a mostly black congregation of the [[Reformed]] denomination known as the [[United Church of Christ]]. She and Barack Obama were married there by Rev. [[Jeremiah Wright]]. On May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ saying: "Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2008/05/obama_resigns_from_trinity_uni.html|title=Obama resigns from Trinity United Church of Christ.

At the 49th [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]]'s general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees to advocate for political awareness, saying, "To anyone who says that church is no place to talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better – no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues – they are moral issues, they're issues that have to do with human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids."<ref>{{cite press release|last=Obama|first=Michelle|title=Remarks by the First Lady at the African Methodist Episcopal Church Conference|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/28/remarks-first-lady-african-methodist-episcopal-church-conference|publisher=[[White House]]|access-date=February 22, 2013}}</ref>

==Barack Obama political campaigns==
===Early campaigns===
During an interview in 1996, Michelle Obama acknowledged there was a "strong possibility" her husband would begin a political career, but said she was "wary" of the process. She knew it meant their lives would be subject to scrutiny and she was intensely private.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/01/19/a-couple-in-chicago|title=A Couple in Chicago|work=The New Yorker|first=Mariana|last=Cook|date=January 19, 2009}}</ref>

Although she campaigned on her husband's behalf since early in his political career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama#Campaign for Bobby Rush's congressional seat|her husband's 2000 run]] for [[United States House of Representatives]], her boss at the University of Chicago asked if there was any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new [[Interior decoration|decorating]] ideas.<ref name="NYT0825">{{cite news|author=Kantor, Jodi|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/us/politics/26michelle.html?scp=2&sq=Michelle%20Obama&st=cse|title=Michelle Obama, reluctant no more|work=The New York Times|date=August 25, 2008|access-date=August 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama|page=314|first=David|last=Remnick|year=2011|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0375702303}}</ref> Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama|page=332|first=David|last=Remnick|year=2011|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0375702303}}</ref>

By the time of the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in August, media outlets observed that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than at the start of the race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows such as ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' and publications like ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'' rather than appearing on news programs.

Obama aimed to humanize her husband by relating stories about him, attempting to appeal to female voters in swing states.

Obama advocated for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it.

She also had bee hives installed on the South Lawn of the White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey for the meals of the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2009/3/28/michelle-obama-goes-organic-and-brings-in-the-bees.html |title=Michelle Obama Goes Organic and Brings in the Bees |access-date=April 7, 2009 |date=March 28, 2009 |work=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |author=Bedard, Paul |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401152253/http://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2009/3/28/michelle-obama-goes-organic-and-brings-in-the-bees.html |archive-date=April 1, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="garden">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/19/AR2009031902886.html|title=Shovel-Ready Project: A White House Garden|last=Black|first=Jane|date=March 20, 2009|work=The Washington Post|access-date=May 3, 2009}}</ref><ref name=AaYoLtFLSOaL/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/whitehouse/photos/0,27424,1905324,00.html|title=White House Photo Blog: Wednesday, June 17, 2009: First Garden|access-date=April 7, 2010|date=June 17, 2009|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>

On August 18, 2020, Obama was factchecked by the ''[[Associated Press]]'' who pointed out that in her speech to the [[Democratic National Convention]], she criticized President [[Donald Trump]] for putting immigrant children in cages and tearing them apart from their families, while leaving out of her speech the fact that the policy of putting immigrant children in such cages also occurred during the Obama Administration. The ''Associated Press'', however, reported the policy of removing children from their families was, in fact, new under Trump's “zero tolerance” enforcement policy; the Obama administration only separated families in cases in which the parents were serious criminals or the child's safety was at risk.<ref name="APFactCheckObama08182020">Woodward, Calvin & Hope Yen.
