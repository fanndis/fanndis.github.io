==Early work (1993–2010)==
Georgieva started her career at the [[World Bank Group]] in 1993 as an environmental economist for Europe and Central Asia. Following this, she served in various positions in the bank ultimately rising to become director of the Environment Department in charge of World Bank's environmental strategy, policies, and lending. In this role she oversaw around 60% of lending operations of the World Bank Group. From 2004 to 2007 she was the institution's director and resident representative in the Russian Federation, based in Moscow.

She returned to Washington, D.C., to become director of Strategy and Operations, Sustainable Development. Her final position at the World Bank, vice president and corporate secretary, conveyed lead responsibility for liaison with the members of the institution's board of executive directors, representing the bank's shareholders (the member country governments).<ref name="ec.europa.eu">{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/danmark/documents/alle_emner/institutionelle/cv-georgieva_en.pdf|title=Kristalina Georgieva CV|publisher=European Union}}</ref> During that time, she worked on the bank's governance reform and accompanying capital increase.<ref name="autogenerated1">[https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sgsm16772.doc.htm Secretary-General Appoints High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing] [[United Nations Secretary-General]], press release of 21 May 2015.</ref>

==Political career==

===European Commissioner===
'''Nomination and confirmation'''

After the former Bulgarian nominee for the post of [[European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management]], [[Rumiana Jeleva]], came under fire during her confirmation hearing from [[Member of the European Parliament|members]] of the [[European Parliament]] over both her competence and allegations of gaps in her declaration of financial interests, she withdrew her bid. The Bulgarian government then proposed Kristalina Georgieva as their new candidate.<ref name="afpnom" /> On 21 January 2010 the [[European Commission]] [[President of the European Commission|President]] [[José Manuel Barroso]] met with Georgieva and expressed his approval, stating that "Mrs. Georgieva has solid international experience and knowledge with which she is going to contribute significantly in her capacity as a EU Commissioner".<ref name="bargeomeet">{{cite news |title=Barroso Welcomes New Bulgarian EU Commissioner-Designate Georgieva |newspaper=Novinite |date=21 January 2010 |url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=112236 |accessdate=21 January 2010}}</ref>

The confirmation hearing of Georgieva took place at the European Parliament on 4 February 2010. She faced questions on her suitability for the portfolio. Georgieva identified [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti]] as a priority, especially the need to provide shelter and health services and to restore the functions and service of the government, so as to start work on reconstruction and long-term development. Other key issues raised in discussions with [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s had been improving co-ordination within the EU (and within the commission), and between humanitarian and military players in order to meet the dual challenge posed by expanding needs and shrinking budgets. The need to improve the effectiveness of EU actions and for better response capacity had also been stressed, together with the establishment of European Voluntary Humanitarian Corps.<ref name="ephear">{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/hearings/headlines/product.htm?language=EN&ref=20100128STO68176&secondRef=0 |title=MEPs quiz new Bulgarian candidate Kristalina Georgieva |accessdate=4 February 2010 |date=3 February 2010 |publisher=European Parliament }}{{dead link|date=March 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Georgieva was given a warm response by MEPs, with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MEP [[Michael Cashman]] praising her "honesty and deep breadth of knowledge". She was applauded by committee members when she told British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MEP [[Nirj Deva]] that she would stand up for the interests of the EU and be an independent mind.<ref name="bbchear">{{cite news |title=Democracy Live – European Parliament |newspaper=BBC |date=3 February 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/europe/newsid_8494000/8494074.stm |accessdate=4 February 2010}}</ref> [[Ivo Vajgl]], a [[Zares|Liberal]] MEP, also praised her, saying: "let me compliment you on your peaceful manner and the confidence you are exuding today".<ref name="ftchear">{{cite news |title=Bulgaria's nominee well-received by MEPs |author=Joshua Chaffin |newspaper=Financial Times |date=4 February 2010 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fdc3233e-10e6-11df-9a9e-00144feab49a.html |accessdate=4 February 2010}}</ref> Her performance at the hearing was widely publicized in Bulgaria and broadcast live on many national media, where it was seen as question of restoration of national honor following Jeleva's unsuccessful hearing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europe.bg/htmls/page.php?category=223&id=27031 |title=Коментари за изслушването на Кристалина Георгиева като кандидат-комисар – Портал ЕВРОПА |publisher=Europe.bg |accessdate=2014-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307230100/http://www.europe.bg/htmls/page.php?category=223&id=27031 |archive-date=7 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The second college of the Barroso Commission, including Georgieva, was approved by the European Parliament on 9 February 2010 by a vote of 488 to 137, with 72 abstentions,<ref name="wsjapprov" /> and she took office the following day.<ref name="euvtakeoff" />

'''Tenure'''

During her time in office as commissioner for international cooperation, humanitarian aid, and crisis response, Georgieva managed one of the world's largest humanitarian aid budgets and promoted the EU as a global champion for resilience and disaster risk reduction. She strongly promoted the use of synergies between humanitarian aid and civil protection tools, which resulted in a more effective response to crises and disasters worldwide. In this role Georgieva tripled funding for the refugee crisis in Europe.<ref name="CB">Xin En Lee, [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/the-first-ceo-of-the-world-bank-is-female-and-shes-doubled-the-world-.html "Meet the first CEO of the World Bank: She’s made the bank the strongest it’s ever been financially"], ''cnbc.com'', 13 July 2018.</ref><ref name="autogenerated1"/> Georgieva pioneered cash-based assistance and the scaling up of cash and social protection approaches in humanitarian aid, notably for refugees and displaced persons; pushed vigorously for operations based on civil-military cooperation and became a key advocate for the respect of international humanitarian law globally.<ref>[https://ec.europa.eu/echo/what/humanitarian-aid/cash-transfers-and-vouchers_en "Cash transfers and vouchers"], ''ec.europa.eu'',.</ref>

Immediately after taking office, she took responsibility for coordinating the EU response to the humanitarian consequence of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]. As result of her actions, the EU became the primary humanitarian donor in the devastated country. Following this initial baptism of fire, Georgieva has ensured EU's response in a number of crises and disasters that struck the world in 2010, including the [[2010 Chile earthquake|earthquake in Chile]] and the [[2010 Pakistan floods|floods in Pakistan]].

Amid the [[2014 Southeast Europe floods|Southeast Europe floods]] in May 2014, Georgieva coordinated post-disaster assistance and helped prepare [[Serbia]]'s request for aid of as much as 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) a year.<ref>Gordana Filipovic (20 May 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-20/serbia-appeals-for-worldwide-aid-to-recover-after-deadly-floods Serbia Appeals for Worldwide Assistance After Deadly Floods] ''[[Bloomberg Business]]''.</ref>

She also has worked to ensure that longer term prevention and preparedness strategies are in place. In parallel with reacting to natural and man-made disasters, Georgieva made good progress on the three declared priorities of her mandate: building up EU's disaster response capacity by creating the ''Disaster Risk Management Knowledge Centre'' and the ''European Response Coordination Centre'', creating the [[ECHO (European Commission)#EU Aid Volunteers|European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps]] foreseen in the [[Lisbon Treaty]], and proceeding with the mid-term review of the [[ECHO (European Commission)#Mandate and Principles|European Union Humanitarian Aid Consensus]] action plan. This work is expected to pave the way for future legislative proposals.

In May 2015, [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] appointed Georgieva and [[Nazrin Shah of Perak]] as co-chairs of the High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing, an initiative aimed at preparing recommendations for the 2016 [[World Humanitarian Summit]]<ref name="autogenerated1"/> and paved the way for new development and humanitarian solutions, including through facilitating the 'Grand Bargain',<ref>[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-1829_en.htm "European Union helps reshape international assistance at the World Humanitarian Summit"], ''europa.eu'', 20 May 2016.</ref> an agreement between the biggest donors and aid providers, which aims to get more means into the hands of people in need.

Georgieva also spearheaded the creation of the 'EU Children of Peace' initiative which drew attention to the underfunded sector of education in emergencies and is now a top funding priority for the EU.<ref>[https://ec.europa.eu/echo/field-blogs/videos/commissioner-georgieva-annoucing-eu-children-peace-projects_en "Commissioner Georgieva {{sic|announcing|nolink=y}} EU Children of Peace projects"], ''ec.europa.eu'', 17 March 2015.</ref>

===Vice-President of the European Commission===
In 2014, news media reported that the ambassadors of several Western EU countries early on indicated their countries' support for Georgieva to be nominated for the incoming [[Juncker Commission]], indicating that she might get the post of [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]].<ref>[http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/eu-heavyweights-advise-bulgaria-nominate-georgieva-ashtons-job-303093 EU heavyweights advise Bulgaria to nominate Georgieva for Ashton's job] ''[[EurActiv]]'', 26 June 2014.</ref> Her candidacy had been uncertain because of political infighting in Bulgaria. The collapse of the socialist government, however, cleared the path for her nomination. By August, [[Georgi Bliznashki]], Bulgaria's interim prime minister, announced her candidacy to replace Britain's [[Catherine Ashton]].<ref>Christian Oliver (6 August 2014), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/470c234a-1d8c-11e4-8f0c-00144feabdc0.html Bulgarian commissioner nominated for EU foreign policy post] ''[[Financial Times]]''.</ref>

Incoming European Commission President [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] instead assigned the post of [[European Commissioner for Financial Programming and the Budget|Vice-President for Budget and Human Resources]] to Georgieva. She was thus the most senior technocrat in the Juncker Commission, the only one of the seven vice-presidents never to have served as a national minister.<ref>Toby Vogel (2 October 2014), [http://www.politico.eu/article/georgieva-catches-committee-mood/ Georgieva catches committee mood] ''[[European Observer]]''.</ref> In this role she was in charge of 33,000 staff and reporting on how the [[budget of the European Union]] is spent to the European Parliament, the council and the [[European Court of Auditors]]. Within months of taking her new position and amid skepticism about the European Union and its budget of around $159 billion reaching new heights, Georgieva was able to negotiate a several-billion-dollar budget increase for 2014.<ref>Benjamin Oreskes (4 November 2015), [http://www.politico.eu/article/un-chatter-as-georgieva-talks-aid-commission-eu/ Georgieva's UN job mission] ''[[Politico Europe]]''.</ref>

On 7 January 2019 it was announced that World Bank Group President Kim would be stepping down and Georgieva would assume the role of interim president of the World Bank Group on 1 February 2019.

On 21 April 2018 it was announced the World Bank shareholders endorsed an ambitious package of measures that include a $13 billion paid-in capital increase, a series of internal reforms, and a set of policy measures that greatly strengthen the global poverty fighting institution's ability to scale up resources and deliver on its mission in areas of the world that need the most assistance.<ref>[https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/04/21/world-bank-group-shareholders-endorse-transformative-capital-package "World Bank Group Shareholders Endorse Transformative Capital Package"], ''worldbank.org'',21 April 2018.</ref> Georgieva is widely recognised as playing a key role in securing this increase, the largest funding increase in the bank's history.<ref name="CB"/>

Georgieva has also been the architect of many reforms with the bank. Georgieva looked at how each she could foster a bank that promotes collaboration across its institutions and draws in more private sector finance. Georgieva also put aside discreet resources to fund staff teams working on the development of new innovative instruments and solutions, particularly those that boost private sector engagement and mobilize commercial financing or focus on developing results and outcome-based instruments. Ultimately, she has said, reforms will aim to bolster the bank's growing emphasis on results.<ref>Sophie Edwards, [https://www.devex.com/news/the-world-bank-s-new-ceo-kristalina-georgieva-lays-out-her-vision-for-an-agile-bank-90068 "The World Bank's new CEO Kristalina Georgieva lays out her vision for an agile bank"], ''devex.com'', 17 April 2017.</ref>
