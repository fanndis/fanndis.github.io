Prior to her appointment at the FDIC, Bair was the Dean's Professor of Financial Regulatory Policy for the [[Isenberg School of Management]] at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], a post she had held since 2002.

Bair is married to Scott P. Cooper and has two children, Preston and Colleen.

==2008 financial crisis==
Bair assumed a prominent role in the government’s response to the 2008 financial crisis, working alongside and sometimes publicly opposing Treasury Secretary [[Hank Paulson]] and [[Timothy Geithner|Tim Geithner]], then president of the New York Federal Reserve. She also helped shape the resulting [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] of 2010.<ref name="nocera"/><ref name="solomon">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Deborah |title=Bair's Legacy: An FDIC With Teeth |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303365804576429782564662532 |accessdate=13 November 2020 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=7 July 2011}}</ref> 

Shortly after taking charge of the FDIC in June 2006, Bair began warning of the potential systemic risks posed by the growing trend of subprime-mortgage-backed bonds. In the spring of 2007 she met privately with industry executives, urging them to modify adjustable-rate mortgages rather than allow homes to go into foreclosure, which could set off a cascading effect throughout the economy.<ref name="nocera"/><ref name="lizza">{{cite news |last1=Lizza |first1=Ryan |title=The Contrarian |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/07/06/the-contrarian |accessdate=12 November 2020 |publisher=The New Yorker |date=29 June 2009}}</ref> In October 2007, Bair took her argument public with an op-ed in ''The New York Times''.<ref name="nytimes-oped">{{cite news |last1=Bair |first1=Sheila |title=Fix Rates to Save Loans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/opinion/19bair.html |accessdate=11 November 2020 |work=The New York Times |date=19 October 2007}}</ref> 

Within the Bush administration, Bair’s mortgage modification argument was initially at odds with the Treasury Secretary who believed such action would have little effect. Bair also resisted many of the government bailouts of insolvent banks; rather she argued that the government should impose greater accountability by forcing those institutions to sell off bad assets, replace management and re-privatize them, more akin to how the FDIC handles smaller banks. Bair argued that when companies are viewed as “too big to fail” it leads to reckless behavior because there is an implicit guarantee of government support.<ref name="lizza"/> Bair favored “market discipline,” meaning shareholders and bondholders would take losses when an institutional fails.<ref name="nocera"/>

Bair fought against the Federal Reserve’s adoption of the Basel II advanced approaches, which would have allowed large banks to use their own internal models to help set their regulatory capital requirements.<ref name="nocera"/><ref name="tooze">{{cite book | last =Tooze | first =Adam | title =Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World | publisher =Penguin Books | date =2019 | location =New York City | pages =87-88 | isbn =9780143110354 }}</ref> In the aftermath of the crisis, Bair pressed the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] to adopt strong capital and leverage standards.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-24/basel-said-to-consider-3-percentage-point-surcharge-on-big-banks.html Basel Committee said to consider 3% surcharge on biggest banks]</ref> She successfully argued for international adoption of ‘Leverage Ratio’ – a strict capital requirement applying to all of a bank’s assets to complement more subjective capital standards based on the perceived riskiness of a bank’s assets.<ref name="tooze2">{{cite book | last =Tooze | first =Adam | title =Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World | publisher =Penguin Books | date =2019 | location =New York City | pages =313-315 | isbn =9780143110354 }}</ref>

The Troubled Asset Relief Program included a mortgage-relief plan partially modeled on Bair’s loan-modification ideas.<ref name="lizza"/> Following the crisis, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was drafted with a number of provisions Bair sought, including the FDIC’s expanded powers to seize large financial institutions, place agency examiners on-site within banks, recover pay from executives deemed responsible for an institution’s failure, and the requirement of banks to create a ‘Living Will’ as a guide for orderly resolution.<ref name="solomon"/>

In a fictional TV movie about the crises, Patricia Randell played Bair in the 2011 [[HBO]] movie ''[[Too Big to Fail (film)|Too Big to Fail]]'', based on the [[Too Big to Fail (book)|popular book of the same name]] by ''New York Times'' journalist [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.ensemblestudiotheatre.org/patricia-randell|title=Patricia Randell|publisher=[[Ensemble Studio Theatre]]|accessdate=April 3, 2019}}</ref>
