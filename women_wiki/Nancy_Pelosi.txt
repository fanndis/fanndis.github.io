'''Nancy Patricia Pelosi''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|s|i}}; {{nee|'''D'Alesandro'''}}; born March 26, 1940) is an American politician serving as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] since 2019, and previously from 2007 to 2011. Pelosi has served as a U.S. representative from [[California]] since 1987. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], she is the only woman in U.S. history to serve as Speaker and, until [[2020 United States presidential election|the election]] of [[Kamala Harris]] as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], was the highest-ranking female elected official in United States history.<ref name=NYT010219>{{cite web| last=Stolberg| first=Sheryl Gay| title=Nancy Pelosi, Icon of Female Power, Will Reclaim Role as Speaker and Seal a Place in History| date=January 2, 2019| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/nancy-pelosi-house-speaker.html| work=The New York Times| accessdate=January 3, 2019}}</ref> As House speaker, Pelosi is second in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]], after the vice president.<ref>See {{usc|3|19}}</ref>

Pelosi was first elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in [[1987 United States House of Representatives elections|1987]], following her father, [[Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.]], who served as a [[Maryland's 3rd congressional district|U.S. representative from Maryland]] and [[List of mayors of Baltimore|Mayor of Baltimore]], into politics. She is the dean of [[California congressional delegation|California's congressional delegation]], having begun her 17th term in 2019. Pelosi represents {{ushr|CA|12}}, which comprises four-fifths of the city and county of [[San Francisco]]. She initially represented the {{ushr|CA|5|c}} (1987–93), and then, when district boundaries were [[redistricting|redrawn]] after the [[1990 United States Census|1990 Census]], the {{ushr|CA|8|c}} (1993–2013). Pelosi has led the House Democrats since 2003—the first woman to lead a party in Congress—serving twice each as [[House Minority Leader|House minority leader]] (2003–07 and 2011–19) and as Speaker (2007–11 and since 2019).

Pelosi was a major opponent of the [[Iraq War]] as well as the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s [[Social Security debate in the United States|2005 attempt to partially privatize]] [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]. During her first speakership, she was instrumental in the passage of [[Presidency of Barack Obama#Major acts and legislation|many of the Obama administration's landmark bills]], including the [[Affordable Care Act]], the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act]], the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]], and the [[2010 Tax Relief Act]].

Pelosi lost the speakership in 2011 after the Republican Party won a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections. But she retained her role as leader of the [[House Democratic Caucus]] and returned to the role of House minority leader. In the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 midterm elections]], the Democrats regained control of the House.<ref>{{cite news| title=TJ Cox beats Republican Rep.

Pelosi was involved with politics from an early age. She helped her father at his campaign events. She attended [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Inaugural address of John F. Kennedy|inaugural address]] when he was sworn in as U.S. president in January 1961.<ref name=":2" />

In 1958, Pelosi graduated from the [[Institute of Notre Dame]], an all-girls Catholic high school in Baltimore. In 1962, she graduated from [[Trinity Washington University|Trinity College]] in Washington, D.C., with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[political science]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Clymer |first=Adam |date=October 11, 2001|title=A new vote counter—nancy patricia pelosi.|newspaper= The New York Times |location=New York}}</ref> Pelosi interned for Senator [[Daniel Brewster]] (D-Maryland) in the 1960s alongside future House majority leader [[Steny Hoyer]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/15/AR2006111501521.html|title=Pelosi Splits Democrats With Push For Murtha|author=Jonathan Weisman and Lois Romano|work=Washington Post|date=November 16, 2006|accessdate=November 16, 2006}}</ref>

After moving to San Francisco, Pelosi became friends with 5th district congressman [[Phillip Burton]], and began working her way up in Democratic politics. In 1976, she was elected as a [[Democratic National Committee]] member from California, a position she would hold until 1996. She was elected as party chair for Northern California in January 1977, and four years later was selected to head the [[California Democratic Party]], which she led until 1983.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/26/nancy-pelosi-politician-speaker |first= Chris| last= McGreal| title= Nancy Pelosi: is this the most powerful woman in US history?| work= The Guardian| date= March 26, 2010 |location= London |accessdate= June 14, 2010 }}</ref> Subsequently, Pelosi served as the San Francisco [[1984 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] Host Committee chairwoman in 1984, and then as [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]] finance chair from 1985 to 1986.<ref name="FastFacts">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/03/01/us/nancy-pelosi-fast-facts/index.html |title=Nancy Pelosi Fast Facts |date=March 21, 2019 |work=CNN |accessdate=May 9, 2019 }}</ref>

===Elections===

[[File:Nancy Pelosi 1993 congressional photo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Pelosi as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, 1993]]

Phillip Burton died in 1983 and was succeeded by his wife, [[Sala Burton|Sala]]. In late 1986, Sala became ill with cancer and decided not to run for reelection in 1988. She picked Pelosi as her designated successor, guaranteeing her the support of the Burtons' contacts.<ref name="nationnewface">{{ cite web | url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20010806/nichols2/2 | title=Is this the new face of the Democratic Party? | work=The Nation| accessdate=February 3, 2010}}</ref> Sala died on February 1, 1987, just a month after being sworn in for a second full term. Pelosi won the special election to succeed her, narrowly defeating San Francisco supervisor [[Harry Britt]] on April 7, 1987, then easily defeating Republican candidate Harriet Ross on June 2, 1987; Pelosi took office a week later.<ref>{{Cite news | agency= Associated Press | title = Democrat Elected in San Francisco | newspaper = The New York Times | date = June 3, 1987 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=It began in Baltimore: The life and times of Nancy Pelosi |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=January 2, 2007 |url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/It-began-in-Baltimore-The-life-and-times-of-2660281.php |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429202942/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2007%2F01%2F02%2FMNG8QNBFNN1.DTL&type=politics |archive-date=April 29, 2011 | accessdate=January 20, 2019}}</ref>

Pelosi represents one of the safest Democratic districts in the country. Democrats have held the seat since 1949 and [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]], who currently make up only 13 percent of registered voters in the district, have not made a serious bid for the seat since the early 1960s. She won reelection in the regular election in 1988 and has been reelected another 16 times with no substantive opposition, winning with an average of 80 percent of the vote. She has not participated in candidates' debates since her 1987 race against Harriet Ross.<ref>{{cite news|first=Edward|last=Epstein|url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/CAMPAIGN-2006-Eighth-Congressional-District-3-2486421.php |title=CAMPAIGN 2006: Eighth Congressional District / three challengers fight for Pelosi seat|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 20, 2006 |page=B-1|accessdate=October 29, 2006}}</ref> The strongest challenge Pelosi has faced was in 2016 when Preston Picus polled 19.1% and Pelosi won with 80.9%.<ref name=ballotpedia>{{cite web |url=https://ballotpedia.org/Nancy_Pelosi#Elections |title=Nancy Pelosi | website= Ballotpedia.org}}</ref>

===Committee assignments===

In the House, she served on the [[U.S. House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations]] and [[U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]] Committees and was the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee until her election as minority leader.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-11-08-pelosi-congress_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Pelosi to lead Congress | first=Andrea | last=Stone | date=November 9, 2006 | accessdate=May 19, 2010}}</ref>

===Pre-speakership career===
In March 1988, Pelosi voted in favor of the [[Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987]] (as well as to override [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]]'s veto).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/100-1988/h506|title=TO PASS S 557, CIVIL RIGHTS RESTORATION ACT, A BILL TO RESTORE THE BROAD COVERAGE AND CLARIFY FOUR CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS BY PROVIDING THAT IF ONE PART OF AN INSTITUTION IS FEDERALLY- FUNDED, THEN THE ENTIRE INSTITUTION MUST NOT DISCRIMINATE.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/100-1988/h527|title=TO PASS, OVER PRESIDENT REAGAN'S VETO, S 557, CIVIL RIGHTS RESTORATION ACT, A BILL TO RESTORE BROAD COVERAGE OF FOUR CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS BY DECLARING THAT IF ONE PART OF AN INSTITUTION RECEIVES FEDERAL FUNDS, THEN THE ENTIRE INSTITUTION MUST NOT DISCRIMINATE.

She was also the second speaker from a state west of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The first was [[Washington (state)|Washington]]'s [[Tom Foley]], the last Democrat to hold the post before Pelosi.

During her speech, she discussed the historical importance of being the first female to hold the position of speaker:
{{quote|text=This is a historic moment—for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the [[Glass ceiling|marble ceiling]]. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them.<ref name=110speech>{{ cite web | date=January 4, 2007 | url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Text-of-Nancy-Pelosi-s-speech-2625996.php | title=Text of Nancy Pelosi's speech | accessdate=January 19, 2019}}</ref>}}

She also spoke on Iraq as the major issue facing the 110th Congress, while incorporating some Democratic Party beliefs:
{{quote|text=The election of 2006 was a call to change—not merely to change the control of Congress, but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in Iraq. The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.<ref name=110speech/>}}

====Tenure====

As speaker, Pelosi was still the leader of the House Democrats; the speaker is considered to be the leader of his or her House caucus. However, by tradition, she did not normally participate in debate and almost never voted on the floor, though she had every right to do so as a full House member. She was also not a member of any House committees.

Pelosi was re-elected speaker in 2009.

A [[CBS News]] poll conducted in March 2010 found that 37% of registered voters had an unfavorable opinion of Speaker Pelosi, with 11% approving.<ref>{{cite news|last=Montopoli |first=Brian |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20000937-503544.html |title=Poll: Low Favorability Ratings For Pelosi, Reid—Political Hotsheet |work=CBS News |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref> According to a March 2010 [[Rasmussen Reports|Rasmussen]] national poll, 64% of voters viewed the speaker unfavorably, and 29% favorably.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/congressional_favorability_ratings |title=Congressional Favorability Ratings—Rasmussen Reports |website=Rasmussenreports.com |date=May 23, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref>

During and after her tenure as speaker, Pelosi was perceived as a contentious political figure, with Republican candidates frequently trying to tie their Democratic opponents to Pelosi and with moderate Democrats seeking to show their moderate bona fides by expressing opposition to Pelosi.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/nancy-pelosi-interview-696750/|title=Nancy Pelosi: 'They Come After Me Because I'm Effective'|last=Dickinson|first=Tim|date=July 8, 2018|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=August 10, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/the-power-of-nancy-pelosi-666110/|title=The Power of Nancy Pelosi|last=Dickinson|first=Tim|date=June 25, 2018|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=August 10, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/24/trump-pelosi-congress-republicans-238683|title=GOP turns to familiar foil amid Trump woes: Pelosi|work=POLITICO|access-date=August 10, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/01/nancy-pelosi-targeted-republican-2018-midterm-congressional-commercials/469453002/|title=Exclusive: Nancy Pelosi targeted in more than a third of GOP House commercials|work=USA TODAY|access-date=August 10, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/democrats-opposing-pelosi-n899536|title=List of Democrats opposing Pelosi|work=NBC News|access-date=August 8, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

=====Social Security=====

Shortly after winning re-election, President [[George W. Bush]] claimed a [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] for an ambitious second-term agenda and proposed reforming [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] by allowing workers to redirect a portion of their Social Security withholding into stock and bond investments.<ref>{{ cite web | last=Sandalow | first=Marc | url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Bush-claims-mandate-sets-2nd-term-goals-I-2637116.php | title=Bush claims mandate, sets 2nd-term goals | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=November 5, 2004 | accessdate=January 19, 2019}}</ref> Pelosi strongly opposed the plan, saying there was no crisis, and as minority leader she imposed intense party discipline on her caucus, leading them to near-unanimous opposition to Bush's proposal, and subsequent defeat of the proposed plan.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1376213-2,00.html | title=Don't Mess With Pelosi | magazine=TIME Magazine | date=August 27, 2006 | accessdate=February 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1376213-3,00.html | title=Don't Mess With Pelosi | magazine=TIME Magazine | date=August 27, 2006 | accessdate=February 3, 2010}}</ref>

=====Blocking of impeachment proceedings against President Bush=====

In the wake of President George W. Bush's reelection in 2004, several leading House Democrats believed they should pursue [[Movement to impeach George W. Bush|impeachment proceedings against the president]]. They asserted that Bush had misled Congress about [[weapons of mass destruction]] in [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq]], and had violated the civil liberties of Americans by [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|authorizing wiretaps without a warrant]].

In May 2006, with an eye on the upcoming congressional elections—which offered the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the House for the first time since 1994—Pelosi told colleagues that, while the Democrats would conduct vigorous oversight of Bush administration policy, an impeachment investigation was "off the table". (A week earlier, she had told the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that, although Democrats would not set out to impeach the president, "you never know where" investigations might lead.)<ref>{{ cite news | last=Babington | first=Charles | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/11/AR2006051101950.html | title=Democrats Won't Try To Impeach President | work=Washington Post | date=May 12, 2006| accessdate=February 3, 2010}}</ref>

After becoming speaker of the House in January 2007, Pelosi held firm against impeachment, notwithstanding strong support for that course of action among constituents in her home district. In the November 2008 election, Pelosi withstood a challenge for her seat by [[anti-war]] activist [[Cindy Sheehan]], who ran as an independent primarily because of Pelosi's refusal to pursue impeachment.<ref>"Sheehan considers challenge to Pelosi", by Angela K. Brown, [[Associated Press]], July 8, 2007.</ref>

=====The "Hundred Hours"=====

{{Main|100-Hour Plan}}

Prior to the [[United States elections, 2006|U.S. 2006 midterm elections]], Pelosi announced a plan for action: If elected, she and the newly empowered Democratic caucus would push through most of its program during the first hundred hours of the 110th Congress's term.<ref>{{cite web|last=Espo|first=David|title=Pelosi Says She Would Drain GOP 'Swamp'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/06/AR2006100600056.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=October 6, 2013|date=October 6, 2006|quote=...{{nbsp}}As in the first 100 hours the House meets after Democrats—in her fondest wish—win control in the November{{nbsp}}7 midterm elections and Pelosi takes the gavel as the first Madam Speaker in history.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=One Hundred Hours|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/rep-nancy-pelosi/one-hundred-hours_b_33529.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=October 6, 2013|last=Pelosi|first=Nancy|author-link=Nancy Pelosi|date=November 7, 2006}}</ref>

The origin for the name "first hundred hours" is a play on words derived from former Democratic [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s promise for quick action on the part of government (to combat the [[Great Depression]]) during his [[Hundred Days Congress|"first hundred days"]] in office. [[Newt Gingrich]], who became speaker of the House in 1995, had a similar 100-day agenda to implement the [[Contract with America]].

=====Opposition to Iraq War troop surge of 2007=====

{{Main|Iraq War troop surge of 2007}}

On January 5, 2007, reacting to suggestions from President Bush's confidantes that he would increase troop levels in Iraq (which he announced in a speech a few days later), Pelosi joined with Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] to condemn the plan. They sent Bush a letter:
{{quote|[T]here is no purely military solution in Iraq. There is only a political solution. Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain.{{nbsp}}... Rather than deploy additional forces to Iraq, we believe the way forward is to begin the phased redeployment of our forces in the next four to six months while shifting the principal mission of our forces there from combat to training, logistics, force protection, and counter-terror.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/congressional-leaders-call-president-reject-flawed-iraq-troop-surge/ |date=January 5, 2007|title=Congressional Leaders Call on President to Reject Flawed Iraq Troop Surge|first1=Nancy | last1=Pelosi | first2=Harry | last2=Reid | accessdate=January 19, 2019}}</ref>

=====Healthcare reform=====

Pelosi has been credited for spearheading [[Barack Obama|President Obama's]] [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health-care law]] when it seemed it would go down in defeat. After Republican [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]] won Democrat [[Ted Kennedy]]'s former senate seat in the [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|January 2010 Massachusetts special election]], thereby causing the Senate Democrats to lose their filibuster proof majority, Obama agreed with then chief of staff [[Rahm Emanuel]]'s idea that he should do smaller initiatives which could pass easily. Pelosi, however, dismissed the president's fear and instead mocked his scaled-back ideas as "kiddie care".<ref>{{cite news |last=Bzdek |first=Vince |date=March 28, 2010 |title=Why it took a woman to fix health care |newspaper=The Washington Post |location=Washington, DC }}</ref> After convincing the president this would be their only shot at health-care because of the large Democratic majorities they currently had, she rallied her Democratic caucus as she began an "unbelievable marathon" of a two-month session to craft the health-care bill, which successfully passed the House with a 219–212 vote. In Obama's remarks before signing the bill into law, he specifically credited Pelosi as being "one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125294497 |title=Health Care Overhaul Boosts Pelosi's Clout |last=Seabrook |first=Andrea |date=March 29, 2010 |work=NPR}}</ref><ref name="healthcarereform" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0310/34753.html|title=Nancy Pelosi steeled White House for health push|author=Carrie Budoff Brown and Glenn Thrush|date=March 20, 2010 |work=Politico}}</ref>

====112th and 113th Congress====

Though Pelosi was re-elected by a comfortable margin in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], the Democrats lost 63 seats and ceded control of the House of Representatives to the Republicans. After the electoral setback suffered by her party, Pelosi sought to continue leading the House Democratic Caucus in the position of minority leader, the office she held prior to becoming speaker. After Pelosi's disparate intra-party opposition failed to pass a motion to delay the leadership vote,<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowman|first=Quinn|title=Pelosi Staves off Leadership Challenge, Elected Minority Leader, Boehner to Be House Speaker|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/move-to-postpone-house-democrats-leadership-election-fails|work=The Rundown|publisher=PBS|accessdate=May 28, 2011}}</ref> Pelosi was elected minority leader for the [[112th Congress]].

In November 2011, ''[[60 Minutes]]'' alleged that Pelosi and several other members of Congress had used information they gleaned from closed sessions to make money on the stock market. The program cited Pelosi's purchases of Visa stock while a bill that would limit credit card fees was in the House. Pelosi denied the allegations and called the report "a right-wing smear".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.ca.msn.com/top-stories/pelosi-fires-back-at-report-on-insider-trading |title=Pelosi fires back at report on 'insider trading' |author=msnbc.com and NBC News (with contributions by NBC News' [[Luke Russert]] and Frank Thorp) |date=November 14, 2011 |website=MSN Canada—News |publisher=[[MSN]] |accessdate=October 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223121014/http://news.ca.msn.com/top-stories/pelosi-fires-back-at-report-on-insider-trading |archive-date=December 23, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/13/politics/60-minutes-pelosi/index.html |title=Pelosi fires back at '60 Minutes' report on 'soft corruption' |author=CNN Wire Staff (with contributions by CNN's Deirdre Walsh) |date=November 14, 2011 |website=[[CNN]] |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Pelosi-aide-calls-60-Minutes-report-a-smear-2289515.php |title=Pelosi aide calls '60 Minutes' report a 'smear' |last=Lochhead |first=Carolyn |date=November 15, 2011 |website=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}</ref> When the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (or [[STOCK Act]]) was introduced the next year, Pelosi voted for the bill and lauded its passing.

====114th and 115th Congress====

In August 2016, Pelosi said her personal contact information was posted online following a cyber attack against top Democratic campaign committees and she had received "obscene and sick calls, voice mails and text messages". She warned members of Congress to avoid letting children or family members answer phone calls or read text messages.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/08/13/pelosi-bombarded-obscene-and-sick-calls-texts-after-cyber-attack/88684466/|title=Pelosi bombarded with 'obscene and sick' calls, texts after cyber attack|date=August 13, 2018|newspaper=USA Today}}</ref>

In 2017, after Democrats lost four consecutive special elections in the House of Representatives, Pelosi's leadership was again called into question. In June 2017, Representative [[Kathleen Rice]] of New York and a small group of other House Democrats, including [[Congressional Black Caucus]] chairman [[Cedric Richmond]] (LA) held a closed-door meeting to discuss potential new Democratic leadership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/22/politics/democrats-consider-ousting-nancy-pelosi/index.html|title=Democrats meet privately to mull ousting Pelosi|author=Walsh, Deirdre|publisher=CNN|date=June 23, 2017|access-date=June 23, 2017}}</ref> Other House Democrats, including Tim Ryan (OH), [[Seth Moulton]] (MA), and [[Filemon Vela Jr.|Filemon Vela]] (TX), publicly called for new House leadership.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/22/politics/nancy-pelosi-kathleen-rice-democrats/index.html|title=Dem rep on Pelosi: 'It's time for people to know when to go'|first=Eugene |last=Scott|website=CNN|date=June 22, 2017|access-date=June 23, 2017}}</ref> In an interview, Rice said, "If you were talking about a company that was posting losing numbers, if you were talking about any sports team that was losing time and time again, changes would be made, right?

In November 2017, after Pelosi called for the resignation of [[John Conyers]] over allegations of harassment, she convened the first in a series of planned meetings on strategies to address reforming workplace policies in the wake of national attention to sexual harassment. Pelosi said Congress had "a moral duty to the brave women and men coming forward to seize this moment and demonstrate real, effective leadership to foster a climate of respect and dignity in the workplace".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/30/nancy-pelosi-sexual-harassment-reform-meeting-274245|title=Pelosi convenes sexual harassment reform meeting|date=November 30, 2017|work=Politico}}</ref>

In February 2018, Pelosi sent a letter to Speaker [[Paul Ryan]] about the proposed public release of a memo prepared by Republican staff at the direction of House Intelligence Committee Chairman [[Devin Nunes]]. The memo attacked the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] for its investigation of [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]]. Pelosi said the FBI and the Department of Justice had warned Nunes and Ryan that the memo was inaccurate and that its release could threaten national security by disclosing federal surveillance methods. She added that Republicans were engaged in a "cover-up campaign" to protect Trump: "House Republicans' pattern of obstruction and cover-up to hide the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal represents a threat to our intelligence and our national security. The GOP has led a partisan effort to distort intelligence and discredit the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence communities."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/01/schumer-pelosi-ask-ryan-to-demote-nunes-over-memo-382313|title=Schumer, Pelosi ask Ryan to demote Nunes over memo|date=February 1, 2018|work=Politico}}</ref> She charged Nunes with "deliberately dishonest actions" and called for his immediate removal from his position.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/371825-pelosi-calls-on-ryan-to-oust-nunes-over-bogus-memo|title=Pelosi calls on Ryan to oust Nunes over 'bogus' memo|date=February 1, 2018|first=Mike|last=Lillis|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

In February 2018, Pelosi broke the record for longest speech in the House of Representatives when she spent more than eight hours recounting stories from [[DREAMers]]—people brought to the United States as minors by undocumented immigrants—to object to a budget deal that would raise spending caps without addressing the future of [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals|DACA recipients]], who were at risk of deportation by the Trump administration.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/07/politics/nancy-pelosi-house-democrats-spending-deal-congress-shutdown/index.html|title=Pelosi marathon speech on DACA sets record|author1=Daniella Diaz |author2=Deirdre Walsh|work=CNN|access-date=February 8, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/02/07/nancy-pelosi-spends-three-hours-reading-dreamer-stories-house-floor/315717002/|title=Nancy Pelosi told DREAMer stories for more than eight hours on the House floor|work=USA TODAY|access-date=February 8, 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/us/politics/pelosi-dreamers-budget-deal.html|title=Pelosi Held House Floor in Advocacy of 'Dreamers' for More Than Eight Hours|author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg |work=The New York Times|date=February 7, 2018|access-date=February 8, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

===Second speakership (2019–present)===

In the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 midterm elections]], the Democrats regained a majority of seats in the House.

Pelosi opposed the [[welfare reform]] proposed by President Bush as well as reforms proposed and passed under President Clinton.<ref name="opinionjournal.com"/> She also opposed the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|tax reform]] signed by President Trump in December 2017, describing it as "probably one of the worst bills in the history of the United States of America{{nbsp}}...

====Infrastructure====

In November 2018, Pelosi said she had spoken with President Trump on infrastructure development. Though he "really didn't come through with it in his first two years in office" while it was a topic during his campaign, the subject had not been a partisan matter in Congress. She mentioned potential bipartisan legislative initiatives that would "create good paying jobs and will also generate other economic growth in their regions".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/415561-nancy-pelosi-touts-bipartisan-potential-of-infrastructure |title=Pelosi touts bipartisan potential of infrastructure |date=November 7, 2018 |first=Chris Mills |last=Rodrigo |newspaper=The Hill}}</ref> On May 1, 2019, Pelosi and Chuck Schumer met with President Trump about infrastructure funding.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Nguyen |first1=Tina |title=HAIL SATAN: IT LOOKS LIKE INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK IS COMING EARLY THIS YEAR |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/05/donald-trump-democrats-2-trillion-dollar-infrastructure-deal |accessdate=May 25, 2019 |magazine=Vanity Fair |date=May 1, 2019}}</ref> In late May, a meeting to discuss an impending $2-trillion infrastructure plan was cut short when President Trump abruptly left after only a few minutes.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Holland |first1=Steve |last2=Mason |first2=Jeff |last3=Cowan |first3=Richard |title=Trump torpedoes meeting with Democrats, blasts Pelosi's 'cover-up' accusation |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-congress/trump-cuts-short-infrastructure-meeting-blasts-pelosis-cover-up-accusation-idUSKCN1SS1R7 |accessdate=May 25, 2019 |work=Reuters |date=May 22, 2019}}</ref>

====Disaster relief====

In August 2018, after President Trump signed an emergency declaration for federal aid in combating the Carr Fire in [[Northern California]], Pelosi lauded the move as "an important first step" but requested the president adhere to a wish by California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] for further aid to other hard-hit areas in California. She called for the Trump administration to take "real, urgent action to combat the threat of the [[climate crisis]], which is making the wildfire season longer, more expensive and more destructive".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://thehill.com/homenews/house/400749-pelosi-urges-trump-to-expand-disaster-relief-for-california-wildfires |title=Pelosi urges Trump to expand disaster relief for California wildfires |first=Mike |last=Lillis |date=August 7, 2018 |newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

[[File:Nancy Pelosi speaks at COP25.jpg|thumb|Nancy Pelosi at [[2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP25)]]

In 2019, Pelosi said climate change was "the existential threat of our time", and called for action to curb climate change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://politi.co/2BWFmd1|title='The existential threat of our time': Pelosi elevates climate change on Day One|last1=Adragna|first1=Anthony|last2=Colman|first2=Zack|website=POLITICO|language=en|access-date=January 4, 2019}}</ref>

===Health care===
====Affordable Care Act====

Pelosi was instrumental in passing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010. She was a key figure in convincing President [[Barack Obama]] to continue pushing for health-care reform after the election of [[Massachusetts]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]] in a January [[special election]]—a defeat seen as potentially fatal to Democratic reform efforts.<ref name="healthcarereform">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/health/policy/21reconstruct.html |title=Health Vote Caps a Journey Back From the Brink |author=Sheryl Gay Strolberg, Jeff Zenley and [[Carl Hulse]] |date=March 20, 2010 |work=New York Times}}</ref> After delivering 219 votes in the House for Obama's signature health-care package, Pelosi was both praised and heckled as she made her way to Capitol Hill.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nancy Pelosi Heckled—Sarah Palin Promises November Vote |work=National Ledger |date=March 22, 2010

On March 10, 2017, Pelosi said Democrats would continue battling Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but they would also be willing to form a compromise measure if Republicans reached out for bipartisan support. She indicated her support for the Republican plan to expand Health Savings Accounts and said the question of Republicans' accepting an expansion of Medicaid was important.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/03/10/pelosi-says-democrats-willing-to-deal-on-health-care/99001568/|title=Pelosi says Democrats willing to deal on health-care fixes if GOP reaches out|date=March 10, 2017|newspaper=USA Today}}</ref> In September, Pelosi sent a letter to Democrats praising Senator [[John McCain]] for announcing his opposition to the latest Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and called for lawmakers and advocacy groups alike to put pressure on Republicans in the health-care discussion. Pelosi said the Democrats would be unified as putting "a stake in the heart of this monstrous bill".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/351951-pelosi-touts-good-news-of-mccains-opposition-to-repeal |title=Pelosi: Democrats will 'put a stake in the heart' of ObamaCare repeal after McCain opposition |date=September 22, 2017 |newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

In July 2018, during a speech at Independence First, Pelosi said the goal of the Democrats "has always been to expand coverage and to do so in a way that improves benefits{{nbsp}}... and we have to address the affordability issue that is so undermined by the Republicans."<ref>{{cite news |last=Barrett |first=Rick |title=Nancy Pelosi pushes for national health care plan during Milwaukee visit |publisher=jsonline.com |url= https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2018/07/21/nancy-pelosi-pushes-national-health-care-plan-during-milwaukee-visit/812013002/ |date=July 21, 2018}}</ref> In November 2018, after the Democrats gained a majority in the House following the 2018 midterm elections, Pelosi said, "I'm staying as speaker to protect the Affordable Care Act. That's my main issue, because I think that's, again, about the health and financial health of the America's families and if Hillary had won, I could go home." She further stated that Republicans had misrepresented their prior position of being opposed to pre-existing conditions during the election cycle and called for Republicans to join Democrats in "removing all doubt that the pre-existing medical condition is the law—the benefit—is the law of the land".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://thehill.com/homenews/house/416134-pelosi-staying-as-speaker-to-protect-the-affordable-care-act |title=Pelosi says she'll be Speaker 'to protect the Affordable Care Act' |first=Michael |last=Burke |date=November 11, 2018 |newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

====Abortion====

Pelosi voted against the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]] of 2003 and earlier attempts at similar bans, and voted against the criminalization of certain situations where a minor is transported across state lines for an abortion (HR 748, passed).<ref name="Project Vote Smart Abortion">{{cite web | title=Representative Pelosi on Abortion Issues |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080103212927/http://www.vote-smart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=H0222103 |archive-date=January 3, 2008 |url=http://www.vote-smart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=H0222103 | url-status=dead |date=January 3, 2008 |accessdate=February 3, 2010}}</ref>

She has voted in favor of lifting the ban on privately funded abortions at overseas U.S. military facilities (HA 209, rejected); in favor of an amendment that would repeal a provision forbidding servicewomen and dependents from getting an abortion in overseas military hospitals (HA 722, rejected); and in favor of stripping the prohibition of funding for organizations working overseas that use their own funds to provide abortion services, or engage in advocacy related to abortion services (HA 997, rejected). She also voted in favor of the 1998 Abortion Funding Amendment, which would have allowed the use of district funds to promote abortion-related activities, but would have prohibited the use of federal funds.<ref name="Project Vote Smart Abortion"/>

In 2008, she was rebuked by Archbishop [[Donald Wuerl]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington|Washington, D.C.]], for being "incorrect" in comments she made to [[Tom Brokaw]] on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' concerning [[Catholic theology|Church teaching]] on the subjects of abortion of when a human life begins. The archbishop's statement quoted Pelosi as saying the church has not been able to come with a definition of when life begins. During the interview she said, "over the history of the church, this [what constitutes the moment of conception] is an issue of controversy."<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401080335/http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/archbishop-pelosis-comments-on-abortion-are-false-2008-08-25.html |archive-date=April 1, 2009 | url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/archbishop-pelosis-comments-on-abortion-are-false-2008-08-25.html | title=Archbishop: Pelosi comments on abortion are false |work=The Hill |date=August 25, 2008|accessdate=May 24, 2019}}</ref> In February 2009, Pelosi met with her [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]], Archbishop [[George Hugh Niederauer]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|San Francisco]], and with [[Pope Benedict XVI]] regarding the controversy.

====Contraception====

In a January 25, 2009, interview with [[George Stephanopoulos]] for [[ABC News]], Pelosi said that one of the reasons she supported [[family planning]] services was that they would "reduce costs to states and to the federal government."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://abcnews.go.com/print?id=6725512 | title=This Week' Transcript: Nancy Pelosi | publisher=ABC News | date=January 25, 2009}}</ref>

===Security===
====Gun laws====

[[File:Nancy Pelosi at 2019 End Gun Violence.jpg|thumb|Nancy Pelosi at 2019 End Gun Violence, September 27, 2019]]

Pelosi stands in favor of increased background checks for potential gun owners, as well as the [[Assault weapons legislation in the United States|banning]] of [[assault weapon]]s. In February 2013, she called for the "Boldest possible move" on gun control, similar to a stance made just weeks earlier by former Representative, mass shooting victim, and fellow gun control advocate [[Gabrielle Giffords]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Memoli |first=Michael A. |title=Pelosi calls for 'boldest possible' gun legislation |url= https://latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-pelosi-boldest-possible-gun-legislation-20130207,0,6085487.story |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=February 7, 2013 |accessdate=February 12, 2013}}</ref> In 2012, she was given a 0% rating by [[Gun Owners of America]] and a 7% rating from the [[National Rifle Association]] for her stances on gun control.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nancy Pelosi |url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/26732/nancy-pelosi#.URnJH6WuneI |work=Project Vote Smart |publisher=Vote Smart}}</ref>

In February 2018, following the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]], Pelosi said Republicans' "cowering" to the gun lobby was "an assault on our whole country" and that the victims were "paying the price for our inaction". She requested House Speaker Ryan and Republicans take action via consideration of legislation expanding background checks or authorizing researchers to use federal dollars to examine public health as it relates to gun violence. Pelosi also advocated for the creation of a special committee on gun violence and said Republicans had previously created committees to investigate [[Planned Parenthood]] and the [[2012 Benghazi attack]].<ref>{{cite news |url= https://thehill.com/homenews/house/374095-pelosi-gun-victims-paying-the-price-for-our-inaction |title=Pelosi: Gun victims 'paying the price for our inaction' |date=February 15, 2018 |newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

In November 2018, after the [[Thousand Oaks shooting]], Pelosi released a statement saying Americans "deserve real action to end the daily epidemic of gun violence that is stealing the lives of our children on campuses, in places of worship and on our streets" and pledged that gun control would be a priority for House Democrats in the 116th United States Congress.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://thehill.com/homenews/house/415847-pelosi-americans-deserve-real-action-on-gun-control-after-california-shooting |title=Pelosi: Americans 'deserve real action' on gun control after California shooting |first=John |last=Bowden |newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

====Military draft====

With regard to Representative [[Charles Rangel]]'s (D-NY) plan to introduce legislation that would reinstate the draft, Pelosi said she did not support it.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/20/rangel.draft/index.html | title=Pelosi says no to draft legislation | work=CNN Politics | date=November 21, 2006}}</ref>

====Use of government aircraft====

In March 2009, the ''[[New York Post]]'' wrote that the conservative watchdog group [[Judicial Watch]] had obtained emails sent by Pelosi's staff requesting the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) to provide specific aircraft—a [[Boeing 757]]—for Pelosi to use for taxpayer-funded travel.<ref>{{cite news |date=March 19, 2009 |last=Gertz |first=Bill |author-link=Bill Gertz |url= http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/mar/19/inside-ring/ |title=Inside the Ring |work=The Washington Times |accessdate=March 19, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=March 11, 2009 |last=Earle |first=Geoff |url= http://www.nypost.com/seven/03112009/news/politics/revealed__pelosis_air_rage_159063.htm |title=Revealed: pelosi's 'air rage' |work=New York Post |accessdate=March 12, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=March 12, 2009 |last=Farooq |first=Sajid |url= http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/archive/Pelosi-Out-Divas-Britney-Spears.html |title=Nancy Pelosi Doesn't Fly Coach |newspaper=[[WRC-TV]] |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}</ref> Pelosi responded that the policy was initiated by President Bush due to post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] security concerns (Pelosi was third in line for [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential succession]]), and was initially provided for the previous Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]].

The Pentagon said "no one has rendered judgment" that Pelosi's use of aircraft "is excessive".<ref>{{cite web |date=March 11, 2009 |last=Miklaszewski |first=Jim |author-link=Jim Miklaszewski |url= http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/03/11/1832174.aspx |title=Pentagon mum on Pelosi flights |work=[[MSNBC]] |accessdate=March 11, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090315024222/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/03/11/1832174.aspx |archive-date=March 15, 2009 }}</ref>

===Trump presidency===

[[File:President-elect Donald J. Trump and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, January 20, 2017.jpg|thumb|Donald Trump with Pelosi in January 2017]]

During a news conference on June 9, 2017, after a reporter asked her about [[Donald Trump on social media|tweets by President Donald Trump]] lambasting former [[Director of the FBI|FBI director]] [[James Comey]] following Comey's testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said no one at the White House seemed courageous enough to tell Trump his tweets were beneath the dignity of the presidency and that she was worried about his fitness for office.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/06/09/nancy-pelosi-trump-needs-sleep-and-shes-worried-his-fitness/102673648/ |title=Nancy Pelosi: Trump 'needs sleep' and she's 'worried' about his fitness |first=Erin |last=Kelley |newspaper=USA Today}}</ref> In November, when asked about Democrats beginning the impeachment process against Trump in the event they won a majority of seats in the 2018 elections, Pelosi said it would not be one of their legislative priorities but that the option could be considered if credible evidence appeared during the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/05/pelosi-trump-impeach-house-democrats-244567 |title=Pelosi: Impeaching Trump 'not someplace that I think we should go' |date=November 5, 2017 |work=Politico}}</ref>

In January 2018, Pelosi referred to Trump's [[2018 State of the Union Address]] as a performance without serious policy ideas the parties could collaborate on.

In July 2015, Pelosi said she was convinced Obama would have enough votes to secure the [[Iran nuclear deal]], crediting the president with having made a "very strong and forceful presentation of his case supporting the nuclear agreement with Iran" and called the deal "a diplomatic masterpiece".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/07/30/nancy-pelosi-iran-deal/30887129/ |title=Pelosi says Iran deal 'a diplomatic masterpiece'|first=Susan |last=Davis |newspaper=USA Today |date=July 30, 2015}}</ref>

In 2016, Pelosi argued against two bills that if enacted would block Iran's access to the dollar and impose sanctions for its ballistic missile program: "Regardless of whether you supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), we all agree that Iran must not possess a nuclear weapon. At this time, the JCPOA is the best way to achieve this critical goal."<ref>{{cite news |title=House votes to toughen Iran sanctions |newspaper=The Hill |url=https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/287775-house-votes-to-enhance-iran-sanctions |date=July 14, 2016}}</ref>

In May 2018, after Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, Pelosi said the decision was an abdication of American leadership and "particularly senseless, disturbing & dangerous".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/386767-dems-hammer-trump-over-withdrawal-from-iran-deal |title=Dems hammer Trump over withdrawal from Iran deal |date=May 8, 2018}}</ref>

It is about respecting the United Nations and a multilateral approach, which is safer for our troops."<ref name=MitchellIraq/>

Although Pelosi voted against the [[Iraq War]], anti-war activists in San Francisco protested against her voting to continue funding the war. UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain said Pelosi had to balance the demands of her anti-war constituency against the moderate views of Democrats in tight races around the country in her role as minority leader.<ref>{{cite news |title=SAN FRANCISCO / Anti-war activists take Pelosi to task / Minority leader negotiates with lawmakers to her right |author=McCormick, E. |url= http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/SAN-FRANCISCO-Anti-war-activists-take-Pelosi-to-2524112.php |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=January 15, 2006 |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}</ref> Pelosi has never faced a serious challenger to her left in her district.<ref>{{ cite news | first=Christine | last=Mai-Duc | url=https://latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-nancy-pelosi-just-got-a-challenger-and-1493224950-htmlstory.html | title=Nancy Pelosi just got a challenger and he's a 'pretty hard-core' Bernie Sanders supporter | work=Los Angeles Times | date=April 26, 2017}}</ref>

====Israel====

[[File:PC290116.JPG (1507386841).jpg|thumb|Pelosi at [[AIPAC]]'s annual Policy Conference in Washington, D.C.]]

Pelosi reaffirms that "America and [[Israel]] share an unbreakable bond: in peace and war; and in prosperity and in hardship".<ref name="onIsrael">{{cite web |title=Pelosi Delivers Speech to American Israel Public Affairs Committee |website=democraticleader.house.gov |year=2005 |url= http://democraticleader.house.gov/press/releases.cfm?pressReleaseID=999 |accessdate=January 4, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060202151116/http://democraticleader.house.gov/press/releases.cfm?pressReleaseID=999 |archive-date=February 2, 2006}}</ref> Pelosi emphasized that "a strong relationship between the [[Israel–United States relations|United States and Israel]] has long been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. America's commitment to the safety and security of the State of Israel is unwavering,&nbsp;... [h]owever, the [[war in Iraq]] has made both America and Israel less safe." Pelosi's voting record shows consistent support for Israel. Pelosi voted in favor of the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]] of 1995, which urged the federal government to [[United States recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel|relocate the American embassy in Israel]] to [[Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Trump's actions on Jerusalem come with Democratic support |url= https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Trump-s-actions-on-Jerusalem-come-with-12414559.php |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=December 7, 2017}}</ref> Prior to 2006 elections in the Palestinian Authority, she voted for a Congressional initiative disapproving of participation in the elections by [[Hamas]] and other organizations defined as terrorist by the legislation. She agrees with the current U.S. stance in support of land-for-peace. She has applauded Israeli "hopeful signs" of offering land while criticizing Palestinian "threats" of not demonstrating peace in turn. She states, "If the Palestinians agree to coordinate with Israel on the evacuation, establish the rule of law, and demonstrate a capacity to govern, the world may be convinced that finally there is a real partner for peace".<ref name="onIsrael" />

During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Pelosi voted in favor of Resolution 921: "...{{nbsp}}seizure of Israeli soldiers by [[Hezbollah]] terrorists was an unprovoked attack and Israel has the right, and indeed the obligation, to respond." She argues that organizations and political bodies in the Mideast like [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]] "have a greater interest in maintaining a state of hostility with Israel than in improving the lives of the people they claim to represent". Pelosi asserts that civilians on both sides of the border "have been put at risk by the aggression of Hamas and Hezbollah" in part for their use of "civilians as shields by concealing weapons in civilian areas".<ref>{{cite news |title=Pelosi Floor Statement on House Resolution Reaffirming Support for Israel |url= http://www.newswest9.com/story/5173845/pelosi-floor-statement-on-house-resolution-reaffirming-support-for-israel |newspaper=News West 9 |date=July 19, 2006 |accessdate=August 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141111021503/http://www.newswest9.com/story/5173845/pelosi-floor-statement-on-house-resolution-reaffirming-support-for-israel |archive-date=November 11, 2014 }}</ref>

In September 2008, Pelosi hosted a reception in Washington with Israeli [[Knesset]] speaker [[Dalia Itzik]], along with 20 members of Congress, where they toasted the "strong friendship" between Israel and the United States. During the ceremony, Pelosi held up the replica dog tags of the three Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah and Hamas in 2006 and said she keeps them as a "symbol of the sacrifices made, sacrifices far too great by the people of the state of Israel".<ref>{{cite news |title=Two speakers toast to U.S.-Israel friendship |url= http://www.jta.org/2008/09/18/news-opinion/two-speakers-toast-to-u-s-israel-friendship |newspaper=JTA |date=September 18, 2008 |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}</ref>

In January 2017, Pelosi voted against a House resolution that would condemn the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334|UN Security Council Resolution 2334]]. This UN Security Council Resolution called [[Israeli settlement|Israeli settlement building]] in the occupied [[Israeli-occupied territories|Palestinian territories]] in the [[West Bank]] a "flagrant violation" of international law and a major obstacle to peace.<ref>{{cite news |title=House votes to rebuke UN on Israeli settlement resolution |url=https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/312956-house-votes-to-rebuke-un-vote-on-israel |work=The Hill |date=January 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=AAI Thanks 80 Representatives For Standing Against Illegal Israeli Settlements |url=http://www.aaiusa.org/aai_thanks_80_representatives_for_standing_against_illegal_israeli_settlements |publisher=Arab American Institute}}</ref> She condemned the [[Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions]] (BDS) movement targeting Israel.<ref>{{cite news |title=Omar hits back at Pelosi over BDS remarks |url=https://thehill.com/homenews/house/435841-omar-hits-back-at-pelosi-over-bds-remarks |work=The Hill |date=March 26, 2019}}</ref>

====North Korea====

Nancy Pelosi is one of the few members of Congress to have traveled to [[North Korea]]. She has expressed concern about the danger of nuclear proliferation from the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|North Korean regime]], and the ongoing problems of hunger and oppression imposed by that country's leadership.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?444272-1/democrats-back-farm-bill-leader-pelosi |title=Democrats Won't Back Farm Bill, Leader Pelosi Says |website=C-SPAN.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/71317-8/ |title=Transcript of Pelosi Press Conference Today—Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi |date=July 13, 2017 |publisher=democraticleader.gov}}</ref>

In August 2017, following Trump's warning that North Korea "will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen" in the event of further threats to the United States, Pelosi said the comments were "recklessly belligerent and demonstrate a grave lack of appreciation for the severity of the North Korean nuclear situation. His saber-rattling and provocative, impulsive rhetoric erode our credibility."<ref>{{cite magazine |url= https://www.weeklystandard.com/jenna-lifhits/top-democrats-knock-trump-for-fire-and-fury-threat-against-north-korea |title=Top Democrats Knock Trump for 'Fire and Fury' Threat Against North Korea |date=August 9, 2017 |magazine=The Weekly Standard}}</ref>

In November 2017, after the Pentagon sent a letter to lawmakers stating a ground invasion was the only way to destroy all [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea's nuclear weapons]] without concern for having missed any, Pelosi said she was concerned about Pyongyang's selling nuclear technology to third parties and called for the United States to "exhaust every other remedy".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/05/politics/nancy-pelosi-north-korea-cnntv/index.html |title=Pelosi: Must 'exhaust' diplomatic options on North Korea |date=November 5, 2017 |publisher=CNN}}</ref>

====Russia====

[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in the United States 25 June 2010-2.jpeg|thumb|Pelosi meeting with Russian president [[Dmitry Medvedev]], foreign minister [[Sergey Lavrov]], and ambassador [[Sergey Kislyak]], June 2010]]

In December 2017, Pelosi wrote a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan advocating for the continued House investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election on the grounds that Americans deserved "a comprehensive and fair investigation into Russia's attack" and "America's democracy and national security" being at stake. Pelosi cited the need for Congress to "fully investigate Russia's assault on our election systems to prevent future foreign attacks".<ref>{{cite news |url= https://thehill.com/homenews/house/366138-pelosi-pressures-ryan-to-continue-russia-investigation |title=Pelosi demands GOP continue Russia probe |first=Julia |last=Manchester |newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

In February 2018, after the release of a Republican report alleging surveillance abuses by the Justice Department, Pelosi accused Trump of siding with [[President of Russia]] [[Vladimir Putin]] at the expense of preserving intelligence sources and methods.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://thehill.com/homenews/house/372041-pelosi-nunes-memo-is-a-bouquet-for-putin |title=Pelosi: Nunes memo is a 'bouquet' for Putin |date=February 2, 2018 |newspaper=The Hill}}</ref> In July, Pelosi asserted that Trump was afraid to mention the 12 indictments against people connected to the intelligence community in Russia during his meeting with Putin and questioned what intelligence the Russians had on Trump to cause his behavior.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://thehill.com/homenews/house/397240-pelosi-the-russians-have-something-on-the-president |title=Pelosi: 'The Russians have something on the president' |date=July 16, 2018 |newspaper=The Hill}}</ref> She said Putin would not be welcomed by Congress even if he visited Washington as a result of his actions: "Putin's ongoing attacks on our elections and on Western democracies and his illegal actions in Crimea and the rest of Ukraine deserve the fierce, unanimous condemnation of the international community, not a VIP ticket to our nation's capital." She called for House Speaker Ryan to "make clear that there is not—and never will be—an invitation for a thug like Putin to address the United States Congress."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://thehill.com/homenews/house/398165-pelosi-thug-putin-not-welcome-in-congress |title=Pelosi: 'Thug' Putin not welcome in Congress |newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

====Syria, Libya, and Afghanistan====

Pelosi supports the [[Syria Accountability Act]] and [[Iran Freedom and Support Act]]. In a speech at the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee|AIPAC]] 2005 annual conference, Pelosi said that "for too long, leaders from both parties haven't done enough" to put pressure on [[Russia]] and China who are providing [[Iran]] with technological information on nuclear issues and missiles. "If evidence of participation by other nations in Iran's nuclear program is discovered, I will insist that the Administration use, rather than ignore, the evidence in determining how the U.S. deals with that nation or nations on other issues."<ref>{{cite news |title=Nancy Pelosi: Israel, don't fear Dems in Congress |website=ynetnews.com |year=2006 |url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3320428,00.html |accessdate=January 4, 2007}}</ref> In April 2007, Pelosi visited Syria, where she met Foreign Minister [[Walid Muallem]], Vice President [[Farouk al-Sharaa]] and President [[Bashar Al-Assad]], despite President Bush efforts to isolate Syria, because of militants crossing from Syria into Iraq, and supporting Hezbollah and Hamas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17920536/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/pelosi-shrugs-bushs-criticism-meets-assad/#.XtA-vDozZPY |title=Pelosi shrugs off Bush's criticism, meets Assad |website=NBC News |date=April 4, 2007 }}</ref> During her visit, she conveyed Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] message for peace, and toured in [[Al-Hamidiyah Souq]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Julie Hill|title=Privileged Witness: Journeys of Rediscovery|year=2014|page=39|isbn=9781496916846}}</ref> and the [[Umayyad Mosque]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/07/washington/07diplo.html |title=As One Syria Trip Draws Fire, Others Draw Silence |website=The New York Times |date=April 7, 2007 }}</ref>

In January 2019, Pelosi criticized President Trump's planned withdrawal of [[American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War|U.S. troops from Syria]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].
