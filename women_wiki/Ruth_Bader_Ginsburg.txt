'''Joan Ruth Bader Ginsburg''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/ˈbeɪdər ˈɡɪnzbɜːrɡ/]] {{respell|BAY|dər}} {{respell|GINZ|burg}}; March 15, 1933{{spnd}}September 18, 2020) was an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] from 1993 until her death on September 18, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Editors|first=History com|title=Ruth Bader Ginsburg|url=https://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/ruth-bader-ginsburg|access-date=2020-09-21|website=HISTORY|language=en}}</ref> She was nominated by President [[Bill Clinton]], replacing retiring justice [[Byron White]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Byron R. White |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Byron-R-White |website=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |access-date=27 October 2020}}</ref> and at the time was generally viewed as a moderate consensus-builder. She eventually became part of the [[Ideological leanings of United States Supreme Court justices|liberal wing]] of the Court as the Court shifted to the right over time. Ginsburg was the first Jewish woman and the second woman to serve on the Court, after [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]. During her tenure, Ginsburg wrote notable majority opinions, including ''[[United States v. Virginia]]''{{nbs}}(1996), ''[[Olmstead v. L.C.]]''{{nbs}}(1999), ''[[Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.]]''{{nbs}}(2000), and ''[[City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York]]''{{nbs}}(2005).

Ginsburg was born and grew up in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]]. Her older sister died when she was a baby, and her mother died shortly before Ginsburg graduated from high school. She earned her bachelor's degree at [[Cornell University]] and married [[Martin D. Ginsburg]], becoming a mother before starting law school at Harvard, where she was one of the few women in her class. Ginsburg transferred to [[Columbia Law School]], where she graduated joint first in her class. During the early 1960s she worked with the Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure, learned Swedish and co-authored a book with Swedish jurist [[Anders Bruzelius]]; her work in Sweden profoundly influenced her thinking on gender equality. She then became a professor at [[Rutgers Law School]] and Columbia Law School, teaching civil procedure as one of the few women in her field.

Ginsburg spent much of her legal career as an advocate for [[gender equality]] and [[women's rights]], winning many arguments before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer attorney for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general counsel in the 1970s. In 1980, President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed her to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], where she served until her appointment to the Supreme Court in 1993. Between O'Connor's retirement in 2006 and the appointment of [[Sonia Sotomayor]] in 2009, she was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, notably in ''[[Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.]]''{{nbs}}(2007). Ginsburg's dissenting opinion was credited with inspiring the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009|Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act]] which was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] in 2009, making it easier for employees to win [[pay discrimination]] claims.

Ginsburg received attention in American popular culture for her passionate dissents in numerous cases, widely seen as reflecting paradigmatically liberal views of the law. She was dubbed "The Notorious R.B.G.", and she later embraced the moniker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/how-ruth-bader-ginsburg-became-the-notorious-rbg-50388/|title=How Ruth Bader Ginsburg Became the 'Notorious RBG'|last1=Kelley|first1=Lauren|date=October 27, 2015|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=January 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125073309/https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/how-ruth-bader-ginsburg-became-the-notorious-rbg-50388/|archive-date=January 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ginsburg [[Death and funeral of Ruth Bader Ginsburg|died]] at her home in [[Washington, D.C.]], on September 18, 2020, at the age of 87, from complications of [[Metastasis|metastatic]] [[pancreatic cancer]]. Given the proximity of her death to the [[2020 presidential election in the united states|2020 election]] and Ginsburg's wish for her replacement not to be chosen "until a new president is installed", the decision for President Trump to appoint and all but one of the Republican Senators to confirm [[Amy Coney Barrett]] as her replacement proved controversial after the [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|Senate Republican majority's prior refusal]] to hold a hearing or vote for [[Merrick Garland]] in early 2016 under [[Barack Obama]] after the death of [[Antonin Scalia]].

==Early life and education==

Joan Ruth Bader was born on March 15, 1933, at [[Beth Moses Hospital]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], the second daughter of Celia (née Amster) and Nathan Bader, who lived in the [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] neighborhood. Her father was a [[Jews|Jewish]] emigrant from [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]], at that time part of the [[Russian Empire]], and her mother was born in New York to parents who came from [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], at that time part of [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Women of Interest—Ruth Bader Ginsburg|url=https://www.voicemagazine.org/2020/10/21/women-of-interest-ruth-bader-ginsburg/}}</ref> The Baders' elder daughter Marylin died of [[meningitis]] at age six, when Ruth was 14 months old. The family called Joan Ruth "Kiki", a nickname Marylin had given her for being "a kicky baby". When "Kiki" started school, Celia discovered that her daughter's class had several other girls named Joan, so Celia suggested the teacher call her daughter "Ruth" to avoid confusion.<ref name="Ginsburg, Hartnett" />{{rp|3–4}} Although not devout, the Bader family belonged to [[East Midwood Jewish Center]], a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] synagogue, where Ruth learned tenets of the Jewish faith and gained familiarity with the [[Hebrew language]].<ref name="Ginsburg, Hartnett" />{{rp|14–15}} Starting as a camper from the age of four, Ruth attended Camp Che-Na-Wah, a Jewish [[summer camp|summer program]] at Lake Balfour near [[Minerva, New York]], where she was later a camp counselor until the age of eighteen.{{Sfn|De Hart|2020|p=13}}

In 1972, Ginsburg co-founded the Women's Rights Project at the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), and in 1973, she became the Project's general counsel.<ref name=Hensley /> The Women's Rights Project and related ACLU projects participated in more than 300 gender discrimination cases by 1974. As the director of the ACLU's Women's Rights Project, she argued six gender discrimination cases before the Supreme Court between 1973 and 1976, winning five.<ref name="Lewis, Neil; Supreme Court Woman rejected">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/us/supreme-court-woman-rejected-clerk-chosen-justice-ruth-joan-bader-ginsburg.html|title=The Supreme Court: Woman in the News; Rejected as a Clerk, Chosen as a Justice: Ruth Joan Bader Ginsburg|last=Lewis|first=Neil A.|date=June 15, 1993|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|access-date=September 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717232135/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/15/us/supreme-court-woman-rejected-clerk-chosen-justice-ruth-joan-bader-ginsburg.html|archive-date=July 17, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Rather than asking the Court to end all gender discrimination at once, Ginsburg charted a strategic course, taking aim at specific discriminatory statutes and building on each successive victory. She chose plaintiffs carefully, at times picking male plaintiffs to demonstrate that gender discrimination was harmful to both men and women.<ref name="Lewis, Neil; Supreme Court Woman rejected" /><ref name="Toobin, Jeffrey; Heavyweight" /> The laws Ginsburg targeted included those that on the surface appeared beneficial to women, but in fact reinforced the notion that women needed to be dependent on men.<ref name="Lewis, Neil; Supreme Court Woman rejected" /> Her strategic advocacy extended to word choice, favoring the use of "gender" instead of "sex", after her secretary suggested the word "sex" would serve as a distraction to judges.<ref name="Toobin, Jeffrey; Heavyweight" /> She attained a reputation as a skilled oral advocate, and her work led directly to the end of gender discrimination in many areas of the law.<ref>Pullman, Sandra (March 7, 2006).

Richardson]]'', {{ussc|411|677|1973}}, which challenged a statute making it more difficult for a female service member (Frontiero) to claim an increased housing allowance for her husband than for a male service member seeking the same allowance for his wife. Ginsburg argued that the statute treated women as inferior, and the Supreme Court ruled 8–1 in Frontiero's favor.<ref name="Lewis, Neil; Supreme Court Woman rejected" /> The court again ruled in Ginsburg's favor in ''[[Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld]]'', {{Ussc|420|636|1975|el=no}}, where Ginsburg represented a widower denied survivor benefits under Social Security, which permitted widows but not widowers to collect special benefits while caring for minor children.

Legal scholars and advocates credit Ginsburg's body of work with making significant legal advances for women under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.<ref name="Toobin, Jeffrey; Heavyweight" /><ref name="Lewis, Neil; Supreme Court Woman rejected" /> Taken together, Ginsburg's legal victories discouraged legislatures from treating women and men differently under the law.<ref name="Toobin, Jeffrey; Heavyweight" /><ref name="Lewis, Neil; Supreme Court Woman rejected" /><ref name="Williams, Wendy W., Columbia Journal2" /> She continued to work on the ACLU's Women's Rights Project until her appointment to the Federal Bench in 1980.<ref name="Toobin, Jeffrey; Heavyweight" /> Later, colleague [[Antonin Scalia]] praised Ginsburg's skills as an advocate. "She became the leading (and very successful) litigator on behalf of women's rights—the [[Thurgood Marshall]] of that cause, so to speak." This was a comparison that had first been made by former solicitor general [[Erwin Griswold]] who was also her former professor and dean at Harvard Law School, in a speech given in 1985.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Labaton |first1=Stephen |title=Senators See Easy Approval for Nominee |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/16/us/senators-see-easy-approval-for-nominee.html?mtrref=undefined&gwh=07BFECEB18F681D38A1B48EF38A012DE&gwt=pay |access-date=December 29, 2018 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 16, 1993 |ref=Page A22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171804/https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/16/us/senators-see-easy-approval-for-nominee.html?mtrref=undefined&gwh=07BFECEB18F681D38A1B48EF38A012DE&gwt=pay |archive-date=December 29, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Scalia|first1=Antonin|title=The 100 Most Influential People: Ruth Bader Ginsburg|url=http://time.com/3823889/ruth-bader-ginsburg-2015-time-100/|access-date=December 9, 2016|work=Time|date=April 16, 2015|ref=Scalia, Antonin; Time|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161209182021/http://time.com/3823889/ruth-bader-ginsburg-2015-time-100/|archive-date=December 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Efn|[[Janet Benshoof]], the president of the [[Center for Reproductive Rights|Center for Reproductive Law and Policy]], made a similar comparison between Ginsburg and Marshall in 1993.<ref name="Lewis, Neil; Supreme Court Woman rejected" />}}

==U.S. Court of Appeals==
In light of the mounting backlog in the federal judiciary, Congress passed the [[Omnibus Judgeship Act of 1978]] increasing the number of federal judges by 117 in district courts and another 35 to be added to the circuit courts. The law placed an emphasis on ensuring that the judges included women and minority groups, a matter that was important to President [[Jimmy Carter]] who had been elected two years before. The bill also required that the nomination process consider the character and experience of the candidates.{{Sfn|De Hart|2020|p=277}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Carter |first1=Jimmy |title=Statement on Signing H.R. 7843 Into Law: Appointments of Additional District and Circuit Judges |url=https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-signing-hr-7843-into-law-appointments-additional-district-and-circuit-judges |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=UC Santa Barbara |access-date=September 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Public Law 95-486 |journal=United States Statutes at Large |date=October 20, 1978 |volume=92 |pages=1629–34 |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-92/pdf/STATUTE-92-Pg1629.pdf |access-date=September 26, 2020}}</ref> Ginsburg was considering a change in career as soon as Carter was elected.

At the time, Ginsburg was a fellow at Stanford University where she was working on a written account of her work in litigation and advocacy for equal rights. Her husband was a visiting professor at [[Stanford Law School]] and was ready to leave his firm, [[Weil, Gotshal & Manges]], for a tenured position. He was at the same time working hard to promote a possible judgeship for his wife. In January 1979, she filled out the questionnaire for possible nominees to the [[United States courts of appeals|court of appeals]] for [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|the Second Circuit]], and another for [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|the District of Columbia Circuit]].{{Sfn|De Hart|2020|p=278}} Ginsburg was nominated by President Carter on April 14, 1980, to a seat on the DC circuit appeals court which was vacated by Judge [[Harold Leventhal (judge)|Harold Leventhal]] upon his death.

====Abortion rights====

Ginsburg discussed her views on abortion and gender equality in a 2009 ''[[New York Times]]'' interview, in which she said, "[t]he basic thing is that the government has no business making that choice for a woman."<ref name="nytimes070709">{{cite news |last=Bazelon |first=Emily |date=July 7, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/magazine/12ginsburg-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all |title=The Place of Women on the Court |work=The New York Times |access-date=September 1, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324081841/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/magazine/12ginsburg-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all |archive-date=March 24, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Although Ginsburg consistently supported [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion rights]] and joined in the court's opinion striking down [[Nebraska]]'s [[Intact dilation and extraction|partial-birth abortion]] law in ''[[Stenberg v.

====Search and seizure====

Although Ginsburg did not author the majority opinion, she was credited with influencing her colleagues on the case ''[[Safford Unified School District v.

====International law====

Ginsburg advocated the use of foreign law and norms to shape U.S. law in judicial opinions, a view rejected by some of her conservative colleagues.<!--<ref name="Liptak, Adam; Ginsburg shares views on Influence of Foreign Law" />--> Ginsburg supported using foreign interpretations of law for persuasive value and possible wisdom, not as precedent which the court is bound to follow.<ref name="Liptak, Adam; Ginsburg shares views on Influence of Foreign Law">{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|title=Ginsburg Shares Views on Influence of Foreign Law on Her Court, and Vice Versa|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/us/12ginsburg.html|access-date=March 7, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207070907/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/us/12ginsburg.html|archive-date=February 7, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Ginsburg expressed the view that consulting international law is a well-ingrained tradition in American law, counting [[John Henry Wigmore]] and President [[John Adams]] as internationalists.<ref name="Anker, Deborah E.2" /> Ginsburg's own reliance on international law dated back to her time as an attorney; in her first argument before the court, ''Reed v. Reed'', 404 U.S. 71 (1971), she cited two German cases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Judith|first=Resnik|date=2013|title=Opening the Door: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Law's Boundaries, and the Gender of Opportunities|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/4942|journal=Faculty Scholarship Series|page=83|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218001748/http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/4942/|archive-date=December 18, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> In her concurring opinion in ''[[Grutter v.

====Voting rights and affirmative action====
In 2013, Ginsburg dissented in ''[[Shelby County v. Holder]]'', in which the court held unconstitutional the part of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] requiring federal preclearance before changing voting practices. Ginsburg wrote, "Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet."<ref>{{cite news|title=Between the Lines of the Voting Rights Act Opinion|author=Schwartz, John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/06/25/us/annotated-supreme-court-decision-on-voting-rights-act.html?ref=us&_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 June 2013|access-date=25 June 2013}}</ref>

Besides ''Grutter'', Ginsburg wrote in favor of affirmative action in her dissent in ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'' (2003), in which the court ruled an affirmative action policy unconstitutional because it was not [[Strict scrutiny|narrowly tailored]] to the state's interest in diversity. She argued that "government decisionmakers may properly distinguish between policies of exclusion and inclusion...Actions designed to burden groups long denied full citizenship stature are not sensibly ranked with measures taken to hasten the day when entrenched discrimination and its after effects have been extirpated."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Heriot |first1=Gail |title=Thoughts on Grutter v.

====Native Americans====
In 1997, Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Strate v. A-1 Contractors]]'' against tribal jurisdiction over tribal owned land in a reservation.<ref>{{cite news |title=RBG's Mixed Record on Race and Criminal Justice |url=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/09/23/rbg-s-mixed-record-on-race-and-criminal-justice |access-date=September 23, 2020 |work=[[The Marshall Project]] |date=September 23, 2020}}</ref> The case involved a nonmember who caused a car crash in the [[Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation]]. Ginsburg reasoned that the state right-of-way on which the crash occurred rendered the tribal owned land equivalent to non-Indian land. She then considered the rule set in ''[[Montana v. United States]]'', which allows tribes to regulate the activities of nonmembers who have a relationship with the tribe. Ginsburg noted that the driver's employer did have a relationship with the tribe, but she reasoned that the tribe could not regulate their activities because the victim had no relationship to the tribe. Ginsburg concluded that although "those who drive carelessly on a public highway running through a reservation endanger all in the vicinity, and surely jeopardize the safety of tribal members", having a nonmember go before an "unfamiliar court" was "not crucial to the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the Three Affiliated Tribes" (internal quotations and brackets omitted). The decision, by a unanimous Court, was generally criticized by scholars of Indian law, such as [[David Getches]] and [[Frank Pommersheim]].<ref name=Goldberg>{{cite journal |last1=Goldberg |first1=Carole |title=Finding the Way to Indian Country: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Decisions in Indian Law Cases |journal=Ohio State Law Journal |date=2009 |volume=70 |issue=4 |url=https://sct.narf.org/articles/finding_the_way_to_indian_country-justice_ruth_bader_ginsburgs_decisions_in_indian_law_cases_goldberg_2010.pdf |access-date=September 22, 2020}}</ref>{{rp|1024-5}}

Later in 2005, Ginsburg cited the [[Discovery doctrine|doctrine of discovery]] in the majority opinion of ''[[City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York]]'' and concluded that the [[Oneida Indian Nation]] could not revive its ancient sovereignty over its historic land.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pappas |first1=George D. |title=The Literary and Legal Genealogy of Native American Dispossession: The Marshall Trilogy Cases |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=9781138188723 |pages=217–218 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Literary_and_Legal_Genealogy_of_Nati/CECTDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=ginsburg+discovery+doctrine&pg=PT300&printsec=frontcover |access-date=September 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Gadoua |first1=Renee K. |title=Nuns to pope: Revoke 15th-century doctrine that allows Christians to seize native land |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/nuns-to-pope-revoke-15th-century-doctrine-that-allows-christians-to-seize-native-land/2014/09/09/fe7453ee-3831-11e4-a023-1d61f7f31a05_story.html |access-date=September 21, 2020 |work=The Washington Post |agency=Religion News Service |date=September 9, 2014 |quote=In 2005, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg cited the Doctrine of Discovery in a land-claim ruling against the Oneidas, one of the six nations of the Haudenosaunee.}}</ref> The discovery doctrine has been used to grant ownership of Native American lands to colonial governments. The Oneida had lived in towns, grew extensive crops, and maintained trade routes to the Gulf of Mexico. In her opinion for the court, Ginsburg reasoned that the historic Oneida land had been "converted from wilderness" ever since it was dislodged from the Oneidas' possession.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Johansen |first1=Bruce E. |last2=Pritzker |first2=Barry M. |title=Encyclopedia of American Indian History: Volume I |date=2008 |publisher=[[ABC-Clio|ABC-CLIO]] |location=Santa Barbara |isbn=978-1-85109-817-0 |page=17 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Encyclopedia_of_American_Indian_History/sGKL6E9_J6IC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=ginsburg+discovery+doctrine&pg=PA17&printsec=frontcover |access-date=September 21, 2020}}</ref> She also reasoned that "the longstanding, distinctly non-Indian character of the area and its inhabitants" and "the regulatory authority constantly exercised by New York State and its counties and towns" justified the ruling. Ginsburg also invoked, [[sua sponte]], the doctrine of [[laches (equity)|laches]], reasoning that the Oneidas took a "long delay in seeking judicial relief". She also reasoned that the dispossession of the Oneidas' land was "ancient". Lower courts later relied on ''Sherrill'' as precedent to extinguish Native American land claims, notably in ''[[Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v. Pataki]]''.<ref name=Goldberg/>{{rp|1030-1}} Ginsburg regretted her decision in ''Sherrill'' more than any other decision she made in the court.<ref name=Quinland>{{cite news |last1=Quinlan |first1=Maggie |title=Realization in Ginsburg's final months highlights complex impact on tribal issues, including in the Northwest |url=https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/sep/20/realization-in-ginsburgs-final-months-highlights-c/ |access-date=September 22, 2020 |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=September 21, 2020}}</ref>

Less than a year after ''Sherrill'', Ginsburg offered a starkly contrasting approach to Native American law. In December 2005, Ginsburg dissented in ''[[Wagnon v. Prairie Band Potawatomi Indians|Wagnon v. Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation]]'', arguing that a state tax on fuel sold to [[Potawatomi]] retailers would impermissibly nullify the [[Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation]]'s own tax authority.<ref name=Goldberg/>{{rp|1032}} In 2008, when Ginsburg's precedent in ''Strate'' was used in ''[[Plains Commerce Bank v. Long Family Land & Cattle Co.]]'', she dissented in part and argued that the tribal court of the Cheyenne River Lakota Nation had jurisdiction over the case.<ref name=Goldberg/>{{rp|1034-5}} Ginsburg has suggested that the next justice should be US District Court Judge [[Diane Humetewa]], who is an enrolled member of the [[Hopi]] Tribe.<ref name=Quinland/> In 2020, Ginsburg joined the ruling of ''[[McGirt v. Oklahoma]]'', which affirmed Native American jurisdictions over reservations in much of Oklahoma.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wamsley |first1=Laurel |title=Supreme Court Rules That About Half Of Oklahoma Is Native American Land |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/07/09/889562040/supreme-court-rules-that-about-half-of-oklahoma-is-indian-land |access-date=September 21, 2020 |work=NPR |date=July 9, 2020}}</ref>

====Other notable majority opinions====
In 1999, Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Olmstead v. L.C.]],'' in which the Court ruled that mental illness is a form of disability covered under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blackwell |first1=Geoff |last2=Hobday |first2=Ruth |title=Ruth Bader Ginsburg: I Know This to Be True |date=2020 |publisher=[[Chronicle Books]] |isbn=978-1-7972-0016-3 |page=64 |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/I_Know_This_to_Be_True_Ruth_Bader_Ginsbu/lVPODwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=ginsburg+Olmstead+v.+L.C.&pg=PA64&printsec=frontcover |access-date=September 23, 2020}}</ref>

In 2000, Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in ''[[Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

Researchers at the [[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]] gave a species of [[Mantis|praying mantis]] the name ''[[Ilomantis ginsburgae]]'' after Ginsburg. The name was given because the neck plate of the ''Ilomantis ginsburgae'' bears a resemblance to a jabot, which Ginsburg was known for wearing. Moreover, the new species was identified based upon the female insect's genitalia instead of based upon the male of the species. The researchers noted that the name was a nod to Ginsburg's fight for gender equality.<ref name="Domonoske, Insect Named">{{cite news|last1=Camila|first1=Domonoske|title=Insect Named For Ruth Bader Ginsburg Is Step Toward Equality Of The 6-Legged Sexes|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/02/480437128/insect-named-for-ruth-bader-ginsburg-is-step-toward-equality-of-the-6-legged-sex|access-date=June 3, 2016|website=NPR|date=June 2, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603140630/http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/02/480437128/insect-named-for-ruth-bader-ginsburg-is-step-toward-equality-of-the-6-legged-sex|archive-date=June 3, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brannoch|first1=Sydney|last2=Svenson|first2=Gavin|date=May 2016|title=Leveraging female genitalic characters for generic and species delimitation in Nilomantis Werner, 1907 and Ilomantis Giglio-Tos, 1915 (Mantodea, Nilomantinae)|journal= Insect Systematics & Evolution|volume=47|issue=3|page=209|doi= 10.1163/1876312X-47032141|url=https://zenodo.org/record/269840}}</ref>
