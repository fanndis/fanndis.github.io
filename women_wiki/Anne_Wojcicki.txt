Consumers can purchase testing kits for $99, $199, and $499 which provide information on ancestry, health, and genetic traits. The company takes saliva samples that are mailed in by buyers, and processes the genetic information, posting the results online for the buyer to view.<ref>{{Cite web|last=23andMe|title=DNA Genetic Testing & Analysis - 23andMe|url=https://www.23andme.com/|access-date=2020-12-02|website=www.23andme.com|language=en-us}}</ref>

== Societal impacts from 23andMe ==
'''GlaxoSmithKline:'''

As part of a four year joint collaboration, Glaxo invested $300 million in 2018, granting the company access to the 23andMe database. This is a step forward for potential illness prevention, as Glaxo is a pharmaceutical company and has developed a leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) receptor inhibitor, which could provide major benefits to Parkinson’s treatments, as the LRRK2 gene is an aspect of the pathology of Parkinson’s. <ref name=":1" />

'''Controversies:'''

23andMe has had controversies regarding data privacy. Wojcicki has noted that consent over data privacy is a top priority, and consumers can opt out, although once this data has been sent to companies it can never be retrieved.<ref name=":1" /> Similar concerns have been posted about Glaxo having access to consumer data. Consumers are also upset that Glaxo’s investment does not benefit individual’s whose genetic data has been used for research.<ref name=":1" />
