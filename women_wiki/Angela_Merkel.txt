Merkel was born in [[Hamburg]] in then-[[West Germany]], moving to [[East Germany]] as an infant when her father, a [[Lutheran]] clergyman, received a pastorate in [[Perleberg]]. She obtained a doctorate in [[quantum chemistry]] in 1986 and worked as a [[research scientist]] until 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/04/angela-merkel-germany-coronavirus-pandemic/610225/|title=The Secret to Germany’s COVID-19 Success: Angela Merkel Is a Scientist|first=Saskia|last=Miller|date=20 April 2020|website=The Atlantic}}</ref> Merkel entered politics in the wake of the [[Revolutions of 1989]], briefly serving as deputy spokesperson for the first democratically elected [[Government of East Germany|East German Government]] led by [[Lothar de Maizière]]. Following [[German reunification]] in 1990, Merkel was elected to the [[Bundestag]] for the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. As the protégée of Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], Merkel was appointed as [[Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth|Minister for Women and Youth]] in 1991, later becoming [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] in 1994. After the CDU lost the [[1998 German federal election|1998 federal election]], Merkel was elected CDU [[General Secretary]], before becoming the party's first female leader two years later in the aftermath of a [[CDU donations scandal|donations scandal]] that toppled [[Wolfgang Schäuble]]. 

She was the [[Leader of the Opposition (Germany)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 2002 to 2005. Following the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal election]], Merkel was appointed to succeed [[Gerhard Schröder]] as Chancellor of Germany, leading a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] consisting of the CDU, its Bavarian sister party the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD). Merkel is the first woman to be elected chancellor, and the first chancellor since [[German reunification]] to have been raised in the former [[East Germany]].

In [[Foreign policy of the Angela Merkel government|foreign policy]], Merkel has emphasized international cooperation, both in the context of the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]], and strengthening [[Transatlantic Economic Council|transatlantic economic relations]]. In 2007, Merkel served as [[President of the European Council]] and played a central role in the negotiation of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] and the [[Berlin Declaration (2007)|Berlin Declaration]]. Merkel played a crucial role in managing the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]] and the [[European debt crisis]]. She negotiated a [[2008 European Union stimulus plan|stimulus package in 2008]] focusing on infrastructure spending and public investment to counteract the [[Great Recession]]. In domestic policy, Merkel's "[[Energiewende]]" program has focused on future [[energy development]], seeking to phase out [[nuclear power in Germany]], reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, and increase [[renewable energy]] sources. Reforms to the [[Bundeswehr]] which abolished conscription, [[Health care reform]], and more recently her government's response to the [[European migrant crisis|2010s migrant crisis]] and the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Germany]] have been major issues during her chancellorship.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/angela-merkel/11984378/Angela-Merkel-faces-outright-rebellion-within-her-own-party-over-refugee-crisis.html|title=Angela Merkel faces outright rebellion within her own party over refugee crisis|newspaper=The Telegraph|accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref> She has served as [[List of G7 leaders|senior G7 leader]] since 2014, and previously from 2011 to 2012.

== Education and scientific career ==
Merkel was educated at [[Leipzig University|Karl Marx University, Leipzig]], where she studied [[physics]] from 1973 to 1978.<ref name="Ruetter, Werner, Who's Afraid of Merkel" /> While a student, she participated in the reconstruction of the ruin of the [[Moritzbastei]], a project students initiated to create their own club and recreation facility on campus. Such an initiative was unprecedented in the [[East Germany|GDR]] of that period, and initially resisted by the University; however, with backing of the local leadership of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] party, the project was allowed to proceed.<ref>{{cite news|language=de |work=Der Spiegel |date=27 March 2009 |url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/authoralbumbackground/3852/drogenwahn_auf_der_baustelle.html |title=Drogenwahn auf der Dauerbaustelle |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113154152/http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/authoralbumbackground/3852/drogenwahn_auf_der_baustelle.html |archivedate=13 January 2010 |accessdate=19 August 2011 |url-status = live}}</ref> At school she learned to speak Russian fluently, and was awarded prizes for her proficiency in Russian and mathematics.

Near the end of her studies, Merkel sought an assistant professorship at an engineering school. As a condition for getting the job, Merkel was told she would need to agree [[Unofficial collaborator (Stasi)|to report]] on her colleagues to officers of the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security (Stasi)]]. Merkel declined, using the excuse that she could not keep secrets well enough to be an effective spy.<ref name="Crawford, Alan Czuczka, Tony" />

Merkel worked and studied at the Central Institute for [[Physical Chemistry]] of the [[German Academy of Sciences Berlin|Academy of Sciences]] in [[Adlershof|Berlin-Adlershof]] from 1978 to 1990.

In the [[1990 German federal election|German federal election of 1990]], the first to be held following reunification, Merkel successfully stood for election to the [[Bundestag]] in the parliamentary constituency of [[Stralsund&nbsp;– Nordvorpommern&nbsp;– Rügen (electoral district)|Stralsund&nbsp;– Nordvorpommern&nbsp;– Rügen]] in north [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.focus.de/regional/mecklenburg-vorpommern/kommunen-merkel-im-landkreis-vorpommern-ruegen-erwartet_id_6455183.html|title=Merkel wirbt für gute Finanzausstattung der Kommunen|date=6 January 2010|work=Focus Online|access-date=29 April 2017|language=de}}</ref> She has won re-election from this constituency (renamed, with slightly adjusted borders, [[Vorpommern-Rügen – Vorpommern-Greifswald I]] in 2003) at the seven federal elections held since then.

===Leader of the opposition===
After the [[Helmut Kohl|Kohl Government]] was [[1998 German federal election|defeated at the 1998 election]], Merkel was appointed Secretary-General of the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]],<ref name=":0" /> a key position as the party was no longer part of the federal government.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Merkel oversaw a string of CDU election victories in six out of seven state elections in 1999, breaking the long-standing SPD-Green hold on the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]. Following a [[1999 CDU contributions scandal|party funding scandal]] that compromised many leading figures of the CDU – including Kohl himself and his successor as CDU Leader, [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] – Merkel criticised her former mentor publicly and advocated a fresh start for the party without him.<ref name=":0" /> She was subsequently elected to replace Schäuble, becoming the first female leader of a German party on 10 April 2000.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G4QnDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT117 |title=Angela Merkel: Europe's Most Influential Leader|last=Qvortrup|first=Matthew|date=2016|publisher=The Overlook Press|isbn=978-1468314083|language=en}}</ref> Her election surprised many observers, as her personality offered a contrast to the party she had been elected to lead; Merkel is a [[Centrism|centrist]] [[Protestant]] originating from predominantly Protestant northern Germany, while the CDU is a male-dominated, [[social conservative|socially conservative]] party with strongholds in western and southern Germany, and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has deep Catholic roots.

Following Merkel's election as CDU Leader, the CDU was not able to win in subsequent state elections. As early as February 2001 her rival [[Friedrich Merz]] had made clear he intended to become [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s main challenger in the [[2002 German federal election|2002 election]]. Merkel's own ambition to become Chancellor was well-known, but she lacked the support of most Minister-presidents and other grandees within her own party. She was subsequently outmaneuvered politically by CSU Leader [[Edmund Stoiber]], to whom she eventually ceded the privilege of challenging Schröder.<ref>Barry Turner (ed.) ''The Statesman's Yearbook 2015: The Politics, Cultures and Economies of the World'', Springer 2014 p. 516</ref> He went on to squander a large lead in opinion polls to lose the election by a razor-thin margin in an election campaign that was dominated by the [[Iraq War]]. While Chancellor Schröder made clear he would not join the war in Iraq,<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/09/23/germany.0700/ Schroeder wins second term] ''[[CNN]]'', 23 September 2002.</ref> Merkel and the CDU-CSU supported the invasion of Iraq. After Stoiber's defeat in 2002, in addition to her role as CDU Leader, Merkel became Leader of the Opposition in the [[Bundestag]]; Friedrich Merz, who had held the post prior to the 2002 election, was eased out to make way for Merkel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/opposition-meltdown-the-great-disintegration-act-a-324300.html|title=Opposition meltdown: The great disintegration act|work=Der Spiegel|date=22 October 2004|accessdate=28 November 2015}}</ref>

Merkel supported a substantial [[reform movement|reform]] agenda for Germany's economic and social system, and was considered more pro-market than her own party (the CDU). She advocated German labour law changes, specifically removing barriers to laying off employees and increasing the allowed number of work hours in a week. She argued that existing laws made the country less competitive, because companies could not easily control labour costs when business is slow.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,249207,00.html |title=Merkel fordert längere Arbeitszeit |language=de |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=18 May 2003 |accessdate=27 August 2011 |archivedate=13 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613150234/http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0%2C1518%2C249207%2C00.html |url-status = live}}</ref>

Merkel argued that Germany should phase out [[nuclear power]] less quickly than the Schröder administration had planned.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP_Merkel_Nuclear_phase_out_is_wrong_1006081.html|title=Merkel: Nuclear phase-out is wrong|newspaper=[[World Nuclear News]]|date=10 June 2008|accessdate=27 August 2011|archivedate=16 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616040957/http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP_Merkel_Nuclear_phase_out_is_wrong_1006081.html|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-nuclear-phase-out-explained/a-39171204 | title=Germany's nuclear phase-out explained | work=DW | accessdate=27 July 2019}}</ref>

Merkel advocated a strong transatlantic partnership and German-American friendship. In the spring of 2003, defying strong public opposition, Merkel came out in favour of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. invasion of Iraq]], describing it as "unavoidable" and accusing Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] of [[anti-Americanism]]. She criticised the government's support for the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]] and favoured a "[[privileged partnership]]" instead. In doing so, she reflected public opinion that grew more hostile toward Turkish membership of the European Union.<ref>Marlies Casier and Joost Jongerden, eds. ''Nationalisms and Politics in Turkey'' (2010) p. 110</ref>

On 22 November 2005, Merkel assumed the office of Chancellor of Germany following a [[2005 German federal election|stalemate election]] that resulted in a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]].

Reports at the time indicated that the grand coalition would pursue a mix of policies, some of which differed from Merkel's political platform as leader of the opposition and candidate for Chancellor. The coalition's intent was to cut public spending whilst increasing [[VAT]] (from 16 to 19%), [[social insurance]] contributions and the top rate of [[income tax]].<ref>{{cite news|title=German coalition poised for power |date=11 November 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4429518.stm |work=BBC News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125031009/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4429518.stm |archivedate=25 November 2005 |url-status = live}}</ref>

In November 2015, there were talks inside the governing coalition to stop family unification for migrants for two years, and to establish "Transit Zones" on the border and – for migrants with low chances to get asylum approved – to be housed there until their application is approved. The issues are in conflict between the CSU who favoured those new measures and threatened to leave the coalition without them, and the SPD who opposes them; Merkel agreed to the measures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germany-coalition-split-on-transit-zones/av-18824248|title=Germany: Coalition split on transit zones|work=DW.COM|access-date=4 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104013756/http://www.dw.com/en/germany-coalition-split-on-transit-zones/av-18824248|archive-date=4 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[November 2015 Paris attacks]] prompted a reevaluation of German officials' stance on the EU's policy toward migrants.<ref name=ParisAttacksMigrants>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/11/14/world/europe/ap-eu-germany-migrants-rising-tensions.html|title=Paris Attacks Provoke Fresh Migrant Fears in Europe|author=Eldar Emric, Demetri Nellas, and the Associated Press|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 November 2015|accessdate=14 November 2015}}</ref> There appeared to be a consensus among officials, with the exception of Merkel, that a higher level of scrutiny was needed in vetting migrants with respect to their mission in Germany.<ref name=ParisAttacksMigrants/> However, while not officially limiting the influx numerically, Merkel tightened asylum policy in Germany.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/29/world/europe/merkel-whilerefusing-to-halt-migrant-influx-works-to-limit-it.html?ref=Europe|title=Merkel, While Refusing to Halt Migrant Influx, Works to Limit It|author=Alison Smale|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 November 2015|accessdate=28 November 2015}}</ref>

In October 2016, Merkel travelled to [[Mali]] and [[Niger]].

The migrant crisis spurred right-wing electoral preferences across Germany with the Alternative for Germany (AfD) gaining 12% of the vote in the [[2017 German federal election]]. These developments prompted debates over the reasons for increased right-wing populism in Germany. Literature argued that the increased right-wing preferences are a result of the European migrant crisis which has brought thousands of people, predominantly from Muslim countries to Germany, and spurred a perception among a share of Germans that refugees constitute an ethnic and cultural threat to Germany.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lucassen|first1=Geertje|last2=Lubbers|first2=Marcel|title=Who Fears What?

Merkel's foreign policy has focused on strengthening European cooperation and international trade agreements. Merkel has been widely described as the ''de facto'' leader of the [[European Union]] throughout her tenure as Chancellor.

In [[2015 G20 Antalya summit|2015]], with the absence of [[Stephen Harper]], Merkel became the only leader to have attended every [[G20]] meeting since the first in [[2008 G20 Washington summit|2008]], having been present at a record [[List of G20 summits|fourteen summits]] as of [[2019 G20 Osaka summit|2019]].

One of Merkel's priorities was strengthening transatlantic economic relations. She signed the agreement for the Transatlantic Economic Council on 30 April 2007 at the White House.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=11 September 2012|title=Enterprise policies|url= http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/international/files/tec_framework_en.pdf|publisher=[[European Council]]}}</ref>

In recognition of the importance of [[People's Republic of China|China]] to the German economy, by 2014 Merkel had led seven trade delegations to China since assuming office in 2005.

===Social expenditure===

At the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, 2013, she said that Europe had only 7% of the global population and produced only 25% of the global GDP, but that it accounted for almost 50% of global social expenditure. She went on to say that Europe could only maintain its prosperity by being innovative and measuring itself against the best.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesregierung.de/ContentArchiv/DE/Archiv17/Reden/2013/01/2013-01-24-merkel-davos.html |title=Bundesregierung {{pipe}} Rede von Bundeskanzlerin Merkel beim Jahrestreffen 2013 des World Economic Forum |language=de |publisher=Bundesregierung.de |date=24 January 2013 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref> Since then, this comparison has become a central element in major speeches.<ref>Among others, in her speech on the occasion of her honorary doctoral degree at the [[University of Szeged]] in Hungary, see http://www.bundesregierung.de/Content/DE/Rede/2015/02/2015-02-02-merkel-budapest.html.</ref> The international financial press has widely commented on her thesis, with ''The Economist'' saying that:

{{blockquote|If Mrs Merkel's vision is pragmatic, so too is her plan for implementing it. It can be boiled down to three statistics, a few charts and some facts on an A4 sheet of paper. The three figures are 7%, 25% and 50%. Mrs Merkel never tires of saying that Europe has 7% of the world's population, 25% of its GDP and 50% of its social spending. If the region is to prosper in competition with emerging countries, it cannot continue to be so generous.<ref name="economist.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21579144-germanys-vision-europe-all-about-making-continent-more-competitive-merkel |title=The Merkel plan |work=The Economist |date=15 June 2013 |accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref>}}

The ''[[Financial Times]]'' commented:

Most probably, the author claims, Merkel's 50% ratio is the product of a mere, simple projection of data for the OECD-member countries onto the world level <http://www.oecd.org/social/expenditure.htm>. Tausch also claims that the data reveal the successful social Keynesianism of the Anglo-Saxon overseas democracies, which are in stark contrast to the savings agenda in the framework of the European "[[European Fiscal Compact|fiscal pact"]], see Tausch, Arno, Wo Frau Kanzlerin Angela Merkel Irrt: Der Sozialschutz in Der Welt, Der Anteil Europas Und Die Beurteilung Seiner Effizienz (Where Chancellor Angela Merkel Got it Wrong: Social Protection in the World, Europe's Share in it and the Assessment of its Efficiency) (4 September 2015). {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.2656113}}}}}}

===Cabinets===

The [[Cabinet Merkel I|first cabinet of Angela Merkel]] was sworn in at 16:00 [[Central European Time|CET]] on 22 November 2005. On 31 October 2005, after the defeat of his favoured candidate for the position of Secretary General of the SPD, [[Franz Müntefering]] indicated that he would resign as party chairman, which he did in November. Ostensibly responding to this, [[Edmund Stoiber]] (CSU), who was originally nominated as Minister for Economics and Technology, announced his withdrawal on 1 November 2005. While this was initially seen as a blow to Merkel's attempt at forming a viable coalition, the manner in which Stoiber withdrew earned him much ridicule and severely undermined his position as a Merkel rival. Separate conferences of the CDU, CSU, and SPD approved the proposed Cabinet on 14 November 2005. The [[Second Merkel cabinet|second Cabinet of Angela Merkel]] was sworn in on 28 October 2009.<ref name="cabinet2009">{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4836127,00.html |title=Merkel's new cabinet sworn in |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=30 October 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2009 |last=Penfold |first=Chuck |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601171452/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0%2C%2C4836127%2C00.html |archivedate=1 June 2010  }}</ref>

On 29 October 2018, Merkel announced that she would not seek reelection as leader of CDU at their party conference in December 2018, but intended to remain as chancellor until the [[2021 German federal election]] is to be held. She stated that she does not plan to seek any political office after this.

==Comparisons==
[[File:Press conference EU-Mercosul on June 26, 2019 (VII).jpg|thumb|Merkel, often depicted as the unofficial leader of Europe, at the [[2019 G20 Osaka summit]]]]
As a female politician from a centre-right party who is also a scientist, Merkel has been compared by many in the English-language press to former British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] (Thatcher also had a science degree from [[Oxford University]] in chemistry). Some have referred to her as "Iron Lady", "Iron Girl", and even "The Iron Frau", all alluding to Thatcher, whose nickname was "The Iron Lady". Political commentators have debated the precise extent to which their agendas are similar.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2122001/ |title=Is Angela Merkel the next Maggie Thatcher? |newspaper=Slate |date=5 July 2005 |last=Risen |first=Clay |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428223123/http://www.slate.com/id/2122001/ |archivedate=28 April 2009 |url-status = live}}</ref> Later in her tenure, Merkel acquired the nickname ''"Mutti"'' (a German familiar form of "mother").
She has also been called the "Iron Chancellor", in reference to [[Otto von Bismarck]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/node/21540283 |title=The new iron chancellor |date=26 November 2009 |newspaper=The Economist |archivedate=24 November 2011 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124193154/http://www.economist.com/node/21540283  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hillary is America's Merkel, but not in the way Trump thinks |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=18 August 2016 |last=Barro |first=Josh |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-merkel-donald-trump-2016-8 |accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref>

In addition to being the first female German chancellor, the first to have grown up in the former East Germany (though she was born in the West),<ref>{{cite book|last=Langguth|first=Gerd|title=Angela Merkel |date=August 2005|publisher=DTV|location=Munich|language=de|isbn=3423244852|page=10}}</ref> and the youngest German chancellor since the Second World War, Merkel is also the first born after World War II, and the first chancellor of the Federal Republic with a background in natural sciences. While she studied physics, her predecessors studied law, business or history, among other professions.
