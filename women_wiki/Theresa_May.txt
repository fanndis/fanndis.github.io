Ideologically, she identifies herself as a [[one-nation conservative]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/30/theresa-may-sets-out-one-nation-conservative-pitch-for-leadership |title=Theresa May sets out 'one-nation Conservative' pitch for leadership |first=Ben |last=Quinn |date=30 June 2016 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=24 July 2018}}</ref>

May grew up in [[Oxfordshire]] and attended [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]]. After graduating in 1977, she worked at the [[Bank of England]] and the [[Association for Payment Clearing Services]]. She also served as a councillor for Durnsford in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]]. After two unsuccessful attempts to be elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], she was elected as the MP for Maidenhead in 1997. From 1999 to 2010, May held several roles in [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|shadow cabinets]]. She was also [[Chairman of the Conservative Party|chairwoman of the Conservative Party]] from 2002 to 2003. Following [[2010 United Kingdom government formation|the formation]] of [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|the coalition government]] after the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], May was appointed Home Secretary and [[Minister for Women and Equalities]], but gave up the latter role in 2012. Reappointed after the Conservative success in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], she became the longest-serving Home Secretary in over 60 years. During her tenure she pursued reform of the [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]], implemented a harder line on drugs policy including the banning of [[khat]] and brought in [[Home Office hostile environment policy|additional restrictions on immigration]]. She also oversaw the introduction of elected [[Police and Crime Commissioners]], the deportation of [[Abu Qatada]] and the creation of the [[National Crime Agency]].<ref name="rentoul">{{cite news |last=Rentoul |first=John |author-link=John Rentoul |date=1 July 2016 |title=Boring and competent Theresa May is what the nation needs after the shock of the Brexit vote |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boring-and-competent-theresa-may-is-what-the-nation-needs-after-the-shock-of-the-brexit-vote-a7114531.html |url-status=live |department=Voices |work=[[The Independent]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701191546/http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/boring-and-competent-theresa-may-is-what-the-nation-needs-after-the-shock-of-the-brexit-vote-a7114531.html |archivedate=1 July 2016 |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>

In July 2016, after [[David Cameron]] resigned, May was elected Conservative Party leader and became the UK's second female prime minister after [[Margaret Thatcher]]. She is the first, and to date, the only woman to hold two of the [[Great Offices of State]]. She began the process of [[Brexit|withdrawing the UK from the European Union]], triggering [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50]] in March 2017. The following month, she announced a [[snap election|snap]] [[2017 United Kingdom general election|general election]], with the aims of strengthening her hand in [[Brexit negotiations]] and highlighting her "[[strong and stable]]" leadership.<ref name="Crace 2018-07-09">{{cite news |url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/brexit-secretary-david-davis-resigns |title=Political crises don't come much bigger than Brexit |last=Crace |first=John |date=9 July 2018 |work=[[GQ]] |accessdate=10 July 2018 |authorlink=John Crace (writer)}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40210957 |title=General election 2017: Why did Theresa May call an election? |date=9 June 2017 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=4 September 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905062304/http://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40210957 |archivedate=5 September 2017}}</ref> This resulted in a [[hung parliament]] in which the number of Conservative seats had fallen from 330 to 317, despite the party winning its highest vote share [[1983 United Kingdom general election|since 1983]]. The loss of an overall majority prompted her to enter a [[confidence and supply]] [[Conservative–DUP agreement|arrangement]] with the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) to support a [[minority government]]. May survived a [[Next Conservative Party (UK) leadership election#12 December confidence vote|vote of no confidence from Conservative MPs]] in December 2018 and a [[2019 vote of confidence in the May ministry|vote of no confidence]] tabled by [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Opposition Leader]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in January 2019. 

As Prime Minister, she carried out the Brexit negotiations with the [[European Union]], adhering to the [[Chequers Agreement]], which resulted in the [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]]. She also oversaw a £20 billion increase in funding to the [[National Health Service]] through the [[NHS Long Term Plan]], established the first-ever Race Disparity Audit and launched a 25-Year Environment Plan, amending the [[Climate Change Act 2008]] to end the UK's contribution to global warming by 2050. [[Unemployment in the United Kingdom]] fell to record lows, the lowest jobless rate since 1975.<ref name=ons061516>{{cite web|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/july2017 |title=UK Labour Market, July 2017 |publisher=ONS |date=2017-07-12 |accessdate=2017-07-12}}</ref> After versions of her draft withdrawal agreement were [[Parliamentary votes on Brexit|rejected by Parliament three times]], she resigned and was succeeded by [[Boris Johnson]], her former [[Foreign Secretary]].

===Unsuccessful national attempts===
In the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] May was the Conservative Party candidate for the safe Labour seat of [[North West Durham (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Durham]], placing second to incumbent MP [[Hilary Armstrong]], with future Liberal Democrat leader [[Tim Farron]] placing third.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Stamp|first=Brian Wheeler and Gavin|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-46225949|title=The Theresa May story|date=2019-05-24|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-03-27|language=en-GB}}</ref> May then stood at the [[1994 Barking by-election]], which was prompted by the death of Labour MP [[Jo Richardson]]. The seat had been continuously held by Labour since it was created in 1945, and Labour candidate [[Margaret Hodge]] was expected to win easily, which she did.

==Early Parliamentary career==
Having entered [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], May became a member of [[William Hague]]'s front-bench [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition (United Kingdom)|Opposition]] team, as Shadow Spokesman for Schools, Disabled People and Women (1998–1999). She became the first of the 1997 MPs to enter the Shadow Cabinet when in 1999 she was appointed Shadow Education and Employment Secretary. After the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 election]] the new Conservative leader [[Iain Duncan Smith]] kept her in the Shadow Cabinet, moving her to the Transport portfolio.

May was appointed the first female [[Chairman of the Conservative Party]] in July 2002. During her speech at the 2002 Conservative Party Conference, she explained why, in her view, her party must change: "You know what people call us? The Nasty Party.<ref name="Knowles2007">{{cite book|first=Elizabeth|last=Knowles|title=Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rjLTsncFKCgC&pg=PA217|date=23 August 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-920895-1|page=217|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225212002/https://books.google.com/books?id=rjLTsncFKCgC&pg=PA217|archivedate=25 February 2017}}</ref><ref name="Childs2008">{{cite book|first=Sarah|last=Childs|title=Women and British Party Politics: Descriptive, Substantive and Symbolic Representation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2yZ-AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT21|date=8 April 2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-21157-9|pages=21–22|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225212241/https://books.google.com/books?id=2yZ-AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT21|archivedate=25 February 2017}}</ref> In recent years a number of politicians have behaved disgracefully and then compounded their offences by trying to evade responsibility.

She accused some unnamed colleagues of trying to "make political capital out of demonising minorities", and charged others with indulging themselves "in petty feuding or sniping instead of getting behind a leader who is doing an enormous amount to change a party which has suffered two landslide defeats". She admitted that constituency selection committees seemed to prefer candidates they would "be happy to have a drink with on a Sunday morning", continuing to say, "At the last general election 38 new Tory MPs were elected. Of that total, only one was a woman and none was from an ethnic minority. Is that fair? Is one half of the population entitled to only one place out of 38?"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/oct/08/uk.conservatives2002 |title='Nasty party' warning to Tories |last1=White |first1=Michael |date=8 October 2002 |work=The Guardian |access-date=17 May 2019 |last2=Perkins |first2=Anne |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In 2003, after [[Michael Howard]]'s election as Conservative Party and Opposition Leader in November that year, May was appointed Shadow [[Secretary of State for Transport|Secretary of State for Transport and the Environment]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3255441.stm |title=Howard unveils his top team |date=10 November 2003 |work=BBC News |accessdate=9 June 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060311034146/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3255441.stm |archivedate=11 March 2006}}</ref>

In June 2004, she was moved to become [[Shadow Secretary of State for the Family]]. Following the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] she was also made Shadow [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]]. [[David Cameron]] appointed her [[Shadow Leader of the House of Commons]] in December 2005 after his accession to the leadership. In January 2009, May was made Shadow [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]].

On 6 May 2010, May was re-elected MP for Maidenhead with an increased majority of 16,769{{spaced ndash}}60% of the vote. This followed an earlier failed attempt by the Liberal Democrats to unseat her in 2005, as one of that party's leading "decapitation-strategy" targets.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1489270/Defiant-Kennedy-takes-decapitation-strategy-into-Tory-heartland.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=4 May 2005 |location=London |title=Defiant Kennedy takes 'decapitation' strategy into Tory heartland |last2=Sapsted |first1=Brendan |last1=Carlin |first2=David |accessdate=11 July 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706184240/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1489270/Defiant-Kennedy-takes-decapitation-strategy-into-Tory-heartland.html |archivedate=6 July 2016}}</ref>

May's debut as Home Secretary involved overturning several of the previous Labour government's measures on data collection and surveillance in England and Wales.

In 2012, despite inquiries by both [[Scotland Yard]] and the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] ruling that there was no new evidence to warrant further investigation, after discussions with [[Doreen Lawrence|Dame Doreen Lawrence]], May commissioned [[Mark Ellison]] to review Scotland Yard's investigations into alleged police corruption.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/lawrence-murder-police-corruption-will-be-investigated-7811117.html|title=May defies Met to order inquiry after Independent campaign|author=Andrew Grice & Paul Peachey|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 June 2012|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> The report was presented to Parliament by May on 6 March 2014.

In July 2013, May welcomed the fact that crime had fallen by more than 10% under the coalition government, while still being able to make savings. She said that this was partly due to the government removing red tape and scrapping targets to allow the police to concentrate on crime-fighting.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/crime-is-down-by-more-than-10-under-this-government |title=Crime is down by more than 10% under this government |publisher=Home Office |date=18 July 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917172845/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/crime-is-down-by-more-than-10-under-this-government |archivedate=17 September 2016}}</ref>

In 2014, May delivered a speech to the [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]], in which she criticised aspects of the culture of the police force.<ref name="May tells police – change or be changed">{{cite news |last1=Robinson |first1=Nick |title=May tells police – change or be changed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27511997 |work=BBC News|date=21 May 2014 |accessdate=10 July 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214033013/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27511997 |archivedate=14 February 2017}}</ref> In the speech, she said:

{{blockquote|When you remember the list of recent revelations about police misconduct, it is not enough to mouth platitudes about "a few bad apples". The problem might lie with a minority of officers, but it is still a significant problem and a problem that needs to be addressed ... according to one survey carried out recently, only 42% of black people from a Caribbean background trust the police. That is simply not sustainable ... I will soon publish proposals to strengthen the protections available to whistleblowers in the police. I am creating a new criminal offence of police corruption.

On 9 December 2010, in the wake of violent [[2010 United Kingdom student protests|student demonstrations]] in central London against increases to higher-education [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]], May praised the actions of the police in controlling the demonstrations but was described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as "under growing political pressure" due to her handling of the protests.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8193115/Royal-car-attack-How-did-the-police-get-it-so-wrong-again.html |title=Royal car attack: How did the police get it so wrong |date=10 December 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=10 December 2010 |first=James |last=Kirkup |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210215059/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8193115/Royal-car-attack-How-did-the-police-get-it-so-wrong-again.html |archivedate=10 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Student-Protests-Prince-Charles-And-Camillas-Car-Attacked-As-Protesters-March-On-London/Article/201012215850255?lpos=Politics_News_Your_Way_Region_2&lid=NewsYourWay_ARTICLE_15850255_Student_Protests%3A_Prince_Charles_And_Camillas_Car_Attacked_As_Protesters_March_On_London |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730011732/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Politics/Student-Protests-Prince-Charles-And-Camillas-Car-Attacked-As-Protesters-March-On-London/Article/201012215850255?lpos=Politics_News_Your_Way_Region_2&lid=NewsYourWay_ARTICLE_15850255_Student_Protests:_Prince_Charles_And_Camillas_Car_Attacked_As_Protesters_March_On_London |url-status=dead |archivedate=30 July 2012 |title=Royal car is attacked by protesters |date=9 December 2010 |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=10 December 2010}}</ref>

In December 2010, May declared that deployment of water cannon by police forces in mainland Britain was an operational decision which had been "resisted until now by senior police officers."<ref>{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Porter |title=Police could use water cannon to disperse rioters, Theresa May says |date=12 December 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8197432/Police-could-use-water-cannon-to-disperse-rioters-Theresa-May-says.html |accessdate=9 August 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420083705/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8197432/Police-could-use-water-cannon-to-disperse-rioters-Theresa-May-says.html |archivedate=20 April 2012}}</ref> She rejected their use following the [[2011 England riots|widespread rioting in summer 2011]] and said: "the way we police in Britain is not through use of water cannon.

In the aftermath of the riots May urged the identification of as many as possible of the young criminals involved. She said: "when I was in Manchester last week, the issue was raised to me about the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of crimes of this sort. The Crown Prosecution Service is to order prosecutors to apply for anonymity to be lifted in any youth case they think is in the public interest. The law currently protects the identity of any suspect under the age of 18, even if they are convicted, but it also allows for an application to have such restrictions lifted, if deemed appropriate." May added that "what I've asked for is that CPS guidance should go to prosecutors to say that where possible, they should be asking for the anonymity of juveniles who are found guilty of criminal activity to be lifted".<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitehead |first=Tom |date=14 August 2011 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8700761/UK-riots-juveniles-could-be-named-and-shamed-says-Theresa-May.html |title=UK riots: Juveniles could be named and shamed, says Theresa May |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=28 November 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114224855/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8700761/UK-riots-juveniles-could-be-named-and-shamed-says-Theresa-May.html |archivedate=14 November 2013}}</ref>

====Anti-social behaviour====
In July 2010, May proposed to review the previous [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government's [[anti-social behaviour]] legislation signalling the abolition of the "[[Asbo|Anti-Social Behaviour Order]]" (ASBO). She identified the policy's high level of failure with almost half of ASBOs breached between 2000 and 2008, leading to "fast-track" criminal convictions. May proposed a less punitive, community-based approach to tackling social disorder. May suggested that anti-social behaviour policy "must be turned on its head", reversing the ASBO's role as the flagship crime control policy legislation under Labour.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10784060 |title=Time to 'move beyond ASBOS' says Home Secretary May |date=28 July 2010 |work=BBC News|accessdate=28 July 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728185910/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-10784060 |archivedate=28 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7914859/Home-Secretary-signals-the-end-of-Asbos.html |title=Home Secretary signals the end of Asbos |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731090347/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/7914859/Home-Secretary-signals-the-end-of-Asbos.html |archivedate=31 July 2010}}</ref> Former Labour Home Secretaries [[David Blunkett]] (who introduced ASBOs) and [[Alan Johnson]] expressed their disapproval of the proposals.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/approach-to-antisocial-behaviour-must-be-turned-on-its-head-2037410.html |title=Approach to anti-social behaviour "must be turned on its head" |date=28 July 2010 |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=28 July 2010 |first=Wesley |last=Johnson |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730123651/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/approach-to-antisocial-behaviour-must-be-turned-on-its-head-2037410.html |archivedate=30 July 2010}}</ref>

====Drug policy====
[[File:Deakhat.jpg|thumb|[[Khat]] bundles]]
In July 2013, May decided to ban the stimulant [[khat]], against the advice of the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] (ACMD). The council reached the conclusion that there was "insufficient evidence" it caused health problems.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23163017 "Herbal stimulant khat to be banned"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711045838/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23163017 |date=11 July 2013 }}. BBC News. 3 July 2013.</ref> Explaining the change in the classification May said: "The decision to bring khat under control is finely balanced and takes into account the expert scientific advice and these broader concerns", and pointed out that the product had already been banned in the majority of other EU member states, as well as most of the G8 countries including Canada and the US.<ref>[https://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/may-under-fire-for-banning-khat-8685624.html "May under fire for banning khat".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707042248/http://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/may-under-fire-for-banning-khat-8685624.html |date=7 July 2013 }} ''London Evening Standard''. 3 July 2013.</ref> A report on khat use by the ACMD published in January 2013 had noted the product had been associated with "acute psychotic episodes", "chronic liver disease" and family breakdown. However, it concluded that there is no risk of harm for most users, and recommended that khat remain uncontrolled due to lack of evidence for these associations.<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/144120/report-2013.pdf ACMD Report on Khat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205044630/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/144120/report-2013.pdf |date=5 February 2016 }}. 2013.</ref>

====Family migration====
In June 2012, Theresa May announced that new restrictions would be introduced to reduce the number of non-[[European Economic Area]] family migrants. The changes were mostly intended to apply to new applicants after 9 July 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120611/debtext/120611-0002.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 11 Jun 2012 (pt 0002) |publisher=UK Parliament |accessdate=19 October 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020164414/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120611/debtext/120611-0002.htm |archivedate=20 October 2013}}</ref>

The newly introduced rules came into effect on 9 July 2012 allowing only those British citizens earning more than £18,600 to bring their spouses or their children to live with them in the UK.

====Deportation decisions====
[[File:Memorandum of Understanding on transnational crime (5937407114).jpg|thumb|May, David Cameron and [[Najib Razak]], 14 July 2011]]
At the Conservative Party Conference in October 2011, while arguing that the Human Rights Act needed to be amended, May gave the example of a foreign national who the Courts ruled was allowed to remain in the UK, "because—and I am not making this up—he had a pet cat". In response, the Royal Courts of Justice issued a statement, denying that this was the reason for the tribunal's decision in that case, and stating that the real reason was that he was in a genuine relationship with a British partner, and owning a pet cat was simply one of many pieces of evidence given to show that the relationship was "genuine". The Home Office had failed to apply its own rules for dealing with unmarried partners of people settled in the UK.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15160326 |title= Theresa May under fire over deportation cat claim |date= 4 October 2011 |work=BBC News|accessdate= 5 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111005020900/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15160326 |archivedate= 5 October 2011 }}</ref> Amnesty International said May's comments only fuelled "myths and misconceptions" about the Human Rights Act and Justice Secretary [[Kenneth Clarke]] subsequently called May's comments "laughable and childlike."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/Clarke-hits-childish-remarks/story-13490799-detail/story.html |title=Clarke hits out at 'childish remarks' |date=6 October 2011 |work=Nottingham Post |accessdate=14 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008201216/http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/Clarke-hits-childish-remarks/story-13490799-detail/story.html |archivedate=8 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15160326|title=Theresa May under fire over deportation cat claim|work=BBC News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005020900/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15160326|archivedate=5 October 2011|date=4 October 2011}}</ref>

In June 2012, May was found in [[contempt of court]] by Judge Barry Cotter, and stood accused of "totally unacceptable and regrettable behaviour", being said to have shown complete disregard for a legal agreement to free an Algerian from a UK Immigration Detention Centre.

May pointed to Qatada's deportation as a triumph, guaranteeing in September 2013 that "he will not be returning to the [[United Kingdom|UK]]", and declaring in her 2016 leadership campaign announcement that she was told that she "couldn't deport Abu Qatada" but that she "flew to Jordan and negotiated the treaty that got him out of Britain for good".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Halliday |first1=Josh |title=Abu Qatada will not be allowed back in UK, says Theresa May |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/24/abu-qatada-not-allowed-back-uk-theresa-may-jordan-acquittal-terror |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=24 September 2014 |accessdate=2 July 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160717201355/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/24/abu-qatada-not-allowed-back-uk-theresa-may-jordan-acquittal-terror |archivedate=17 July 2016}}</ref><ref name="rentoul" /> The Qatada deportation also shaped May's views on the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and [[European Court of Human Rights]], saying that they had "moved the goalposts" and had a "crazy interpretation of our human rights laws", as a result, May has since campaigned against the institutions, saying that British withdrawal from them should be considered.<ref name="The Guardian" />

===Leadership election===
{{Further|Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016}}
On 30 June 2016, May announced her candidacy for the leadership of the Conservative Party to replace [[David Cameron]], who resigned following the outcome of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|European Union membership referendum]] in which 52% of voters voted in favour of leaving the EU. May emphasised the need for unity within the party regardless of positions on leaving the EU, saying she could bring "strong leadership" and a "positive vision" for the country's future. Despite having backed a vote to remain in the EU, she insisted that there would be no second referendum, saying: "The campaign was fought... and the public gave their verdict. There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door... Brexit means Brexit". An opinion poll that day found 47% of people choosing May as their preferred candidate to be prime minister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1719848/theresa-may-is-britons-favourite-for-pm-poll |title=Theresa May Is Britons' Favourite For PM – Poll |last=Carr |first=Harry |date=30 June 2016 |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=2 July 2016 |quote=The other candidates lagged far behind, with Michael Gove on 9% |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702045052/http://news.sky.com/story/1719848/theresa-may-is-britons-favourite-for-pm-poll |archivedate=2 July 2016}}</ref>

On 20 July, May attended her first [[Prime Minister's Questions]] since taking office, then afterwards made her first [[List of international prime ministerial trips made by Theresa May|overseas trip as prime minister]], visiting Berlin for talks with German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]. During the visit, May said that she would not trigger [[UK Invocation of Article 50|Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon]]—the process for withdrawing from the European Union—before 2017, suggesting it would take time for the UK to negotiate a "sensible and orderly departure" from the EU. However, although Merkel said it was right for the UK to "take a moment" before beginning the process, she urged May to provide more clarity on a timetable for negotiations. Shortly before travelling to Berlin, May had also announced that in the wake of the referendum, Britain would relinquish the [[presidency of the Council of the European Union]], which passes between member states every six months on a rotation basis, and that the UK had been scheduled to hold in the second half of 2017.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36841066 |title=Brexit: Theresa May says talks won't start in 2016 |work=BBC News|date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720014459/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36841066 |archivedate=20 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first1=Rowena |last1=Mason |first2=Philip |last2=Oltermann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/angela-merkel-backs-theresa-mays-plan-not-to-trigger-brexit-this-year |title=Angela Merkel backs Theresa May's plan not to trigger Brexit this year |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720232931/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/angela-merkel-backs-theresa-mays-plan-not-to-trigger-brexit-this-year |archivedate=20 July 2016}}</ref>

Before the [[Manchester Arena bombing]] and after the [[November 2015 Paris attacks|Paris attacks]], she was warned by a [[Manchester]] senior police officer that the cuts on the force and [[community policing]] risked terror attacks in the city due to the lack of resources to do proper intelligence and anti-terrorist measures.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/theresa-may-warned-by-manchester-police-that-cuts-risked-terror-attack-2017-5?r=UK&IR=T|title=Theresa May was warned by Manchester police officer that cuts risked terror attack in the city|last1=Bienkov|first1=Adam|date=26 May 2017|work=Business Insider|accessdate=26 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/theresa-may-army-deployment-manchester-bombing-police-federation-police-cuts-steve-white_uk_5925d9f0e4b062f96a336e5f|title=Theresa May's Police Cuts Exposed By Manchester Bombing Army Deployment – Police Federation|last1=Waugh|first1=Paul|date=24 May 2017|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=26 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-34875077|title=Police cuts: Terror response warning to home secretary|date=20 November 2015|work=BBC|accessdate=26 May 2017}}</ref>

===Environment===
Following the impact of ''[[Blue Planet II]]'' in 2017, the May administration outlined plans to approve further green policy. A particular focus has been on plastic and its impact on the environment. In March 2018, May announced plans for a plastic deposit scheme modelled on a similar policy in Norway to boost recycling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-43563164|title=Drinks bottles and can deposit return scheme proposed|date=27 March 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

In a leaked recording prior to the Brexit referendum, May said,
{{quote|I think the economic arguments are clear. I think being part of a 500-million trading bloc is significant for us. I think, as I was saying to you a little earlier, that one of the issues is that a lot of people will invest here in the UK because it is the UK in Europe. If we were not in Europe, I think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say, do they need to develop a mainland Europe presence rather than a UK presence? So I think there are definite benefits for us in economic terms.<ref Name="Guardian26/10/2016">[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit Exclusive: what Theresa May really thinks about Brexit shown in leaked recording] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026091230/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/25/exclusive-leaked-recording-shows-what-theresa-may-really-thinks-about-brexit |date=26 October 2016 }} ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>}}

May also said Britain was more secure as part of the [[European Union|EU]] due to the European arrest warrant and Europe-wide information sharing among other factors. She said, "There are definitely things we can do as members of the European Union that I think keep us more safe".<ref Name="Guardian26/10/2016"/>
