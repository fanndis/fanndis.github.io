=== Facebook ===
[[File:Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg meets PM Modi.jpg|thumb|Sandberg meeting [[India]]'s Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] in [[New Delhi]] on July 3, 2014]]
In late 2007, [[Mark Zuckerberg]], co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, met Sandberg at a Christmas party held by [[Dan Rosensweig]].<ref name="newyorker11"/> Zuckerberg had no formal search for a Chief Operating Officer (COO), but thought of Sandberg as "a perfect fit" for this role.<ref name="newyorker11"/> In March 2008, Facebook announced the hiring of Sandberg for the role of COO and her leaving Google.<ref>{{cite web|last=Swisher |first=Kara |author-link=Kara Swisher|url= http://kara.allthingsd.com/20080304/sheryl-sandberg-will-become-coo-of-facebook/?mod=ATD_search |title=Sheryl Sandberg Will Become COO of Facebook |publisher= [[All Things Digital]] |date=March 4, 2008 |access-date= July 22, 2010}}</ref>

After joining the company, Sandberg quickly began trying to figure out how to make Facebook profitable. Before she joined, the company was "primarily interested in building a really cool site; profits, they assumed, would follow."<ref name="newyorker11"/> By late spring,{{when|date=March 2018}} Facebook's leadership had agreed to rely on advertising, "with the ads discreetly presented"; by 2010, Facebook became profitable.<ref name="newyorker11"/> According to Facebook, she oversees the firm's business operations including [[sales]], [[marketing]], [[business development]], [[human resources]], [[public policy]], and [[communication]]s.<ref name=FBM>{{cite web |url=https://newsroom.fb.com/content/default.aspx?NewsAreaId=1 |title=Management - Facebook Newsroom |publisher=FB.com |year=2012 |access-date=July 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616055842/http://newsroom.fb.com/content/default.aspx?NewsAreaId=1 |archive-date=June 16, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2012, she became the eighth member (and the first woman) of Facebook's board of directors.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Raice |first1=Shayndi |first2=Joann S. |last2=Lublin |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304782404577489003831226744 |title=Sheryl Sandberg Joins Facebook Board |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=June 25, 2012 |access-date=October 7, 2012}}</ref>

In April 2014, it was reported that Sandberg had sold over half of her shares in Facebook since the company went public. At the time of Facebook's IPO, she held approximately 41 million shares in the company; after several rounds of sales she is left with around 17.2 million shares, amounting to a stake of 0.5% in the company, worth about $1 billion.<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/sheryl-sandberg-sells-half-her-stake-in-facebook-1.1746213 Sheryl Sandberg sells half her stake in Facebook], ''The Irish Times'', April 2, 2014</ref>

==Criticism==

''The New York Times'' published a report in 2018 detailing Sandberg's role in handling Facebook's public relations after revelations of [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]] and its [[Cambridge Analytica data scandal]].<ref>Frankel, Sheera et al (November 14, 2018) [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html "Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook’s Leaders Fought Through Crisis."] ''New York Times.'' (Retrieved November 15, 2018.)</ref> Soon after, on November 29, 2018, the ''New York Times'' reported that Sandberg had personally asked Facebook's communications staff to conduct research into [[George Soros]]'s finances days after Soros publicly criticized tech companies, including Facebook, at the [[World Economic Forum]].<ref name="nyt-nov" /> In a statement, Facebook said the research into Soros "was already underway when Sheryl [Sandberg] sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook's stock."<ref name="nyt-nov">{{cite web |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Matthew |last2=Confessore |first2=Nicholas |title=Sheryl Sandberg Is Said to Have Asked Facebook Staff to Research George Soros |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/technology/george-soros-facebook-sheryl-sandberg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=30 November 2018 |quote=In a statement, Facebook said that the company had already begun researching Mr. Soros when Ms. Sandberg made her request.  “Mr. Soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to Facebook,” the company said. “That research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook’s stock.” The company said that while Ms. Sandberg “takes full responsibility for any activity that happened on her watch,” she did not personally direct any research on Freedom from Facebook, an anti-Facebook coalition whose members were among the subjects of Definers’ later work.}}</ref>

According to ''The Wall Street Journal'', during a meeting [[Mark Zuckerberg]] blamed Sandberg personally for the outcome of the [[Cambridge Analytica]] scandal, stating that Zuckerberg "blamed her and her teams for the public fallout over Cambridge Analytica,"<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/with-facebook-at-war-zuckerberg-adopts-more-aggressive-style-1542577980|title=With Facebook at 'War,' Zuckerberg Adopts More Aggressive Style|last=Seetharaman|first=Deepa|work=WSJ|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en-US}}</ref> and that Sandberg "confided in friends that the exchange rattled her, and she wondered if she should be worried about her job."<ref name=":0" />

''Lean In'' is intended for professional women to help them achieve their career goals and for men who want to contribute to a more equitable society. The book argues that barriers are still preventing women from taking leadership roles in the workplace, barriers such as discrimination, blatant and subtle sexism, and sexual harassment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sandberg|first=Sheryl|title=Lean In: Women Work and the Will to Lead|url=https://archive.org/details/leanin00sher|url-access=registration|year=2013|publisher=Knopf|page=[https://archive.org/details/leanin00sher/page/8 8]}}</ref> Sandberg claims there are also barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal [[gender roles]]. Sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles. The ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more female voices in positions of power there will be more equitable opportunities created for everyone.

"She's not leaning in at all," [[Roger McNamee|McNamee]] said, in a reference Sandberg's widely read book published five years ago. "If ever there was a time for her to lean in, this is it." <ref name="guardian">{{cite news |last=Solon|first=Olivia|title=Sheryl Sandberg: Facebook business chief leans out of spotlight in scandal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/29/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-cambridge-analytica |date=March 29, 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

In her book, she does suggest other women to lean in during challenges.

Instead, she has been perceived as a [[Chief operating officer|COO]] who avoids engaging in this crisis.
"Sandberg, the architect of the business model that is now the subject of so much scrutiny, has remained silent in public." <ref name="guardian" /> In her book she recognizes those who do tackle crises:
{{quote|I have the deepest respect for people who provide hands-on help to those in crises.

=== ''Option B'' ===
Sandberg released her second book, ''Option B,'' in April 2017. ''Option B'' is co-authored with [[Adam Grant]], a professor at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]. The book puts emphasis on grief and resilience in challenges within life.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/sheryl-sandberg/|title=Sheryl Sandberg|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en}}</ref> It offers practical tips for creating resilience in the family and community. 2.75 million copies have been sold since publication.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.recode.net/2016/7/29/12320222/sheryl-sandberg-leans-into-next-book-option-b-about-grieving-and-healing|title=Sheryl Sandberg leans into her next book, "Option B", about grieving and healing|work=Recode|access-date=2017-11-15}}</ref>

=== Ban Bossy ===
{{main|Ban Bossy}}

In March 2014, Sandberg and Lean In sponsored the [[Ban Bossy]] campaign, a television and social media campaign designed to discourage the word ''bossy'' from general use due to its perceived harmful effect on young girls. Several video spots with spokespersons including [[Beyoncé]], [[Jennifer Garner]], and [[Condoleezza Rice]] among others were produced along with a web site providing school training material, leadership tips, and an online pledge form to which visitors can promise not to use the word.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jolie Lee |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/03/10/ban-bossy-sheryl-sandberg-beyonce-gardner/6262309/|title=Beyonce, Jennifer Garner, Jane Lynch join 'Ban Bossy" campaign.

=== Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation ===

In November 2016, Sandberg renamed her Lean In Foundation to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation. This new foundation will serve as an umbrella for [[LeanIn.Org]] and a new organization around her book, ''Option B''. Sandberg also transferred roughly $100,000,000 in [[Facebook]] stock to fund the foundation and other charitable endeavors.<ref>{{cite news|last=Swisher |first=Kara |author-link=Kara Swisher|url= http://www.recode.net/2016/11/30/13797136/sheryl-sandberg-donation-100-million-facebook-stock-option-b |title=Sheryl Sandberg is donating more than $100 million in Facebook stock to charity |work= [[Recode]] |date=November 30, 2016 |access-date= December 23, 2016}}</ref>
