Before Mazumdar could move, she met Leslie Auchincloss, the founder of Biocon Biochemicals Limited, of [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland. Auchincloss's company produced enzymes for use in the brewing, food-packaging and textile industries.  Auchincloss was looking for an  entrepreneur in India to help establish an Indian subsidiary.<ref name=Breaking />{{rp|154}} Mazumdar agreed to undertake the job on the condition that if she did not wish to continue six months later she would be given a brewmaster's position comparable to the one she was giving up.<ref name=Leading>{{cite book|last1=Leading|first1=Sudha|title=Leading ladies : women who inspire India|date=2010|publisher=Fortytwo Bookz Galaxy|location=Mumbai|isbn=978-81-908411-8-4|edition=1st}}</ref>{{rp|108}}

=== Beginning with enzymes ===
After a brief period as a trainee manager at Biocon Biochemicals Limited, of Cork, Ireland, to learn more about the business, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw returned to India.<ref name=Leading /> She started Biocon India in 1978 in the garage of her rented house in Bengaluru with a seed capital of Rs. 10,000.<ref name=CNN2012>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/15/business/kiran-mazumdar-shaw/index.html|title= $800 million biotech business started in a garage|publisher=CNN|accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref> Although it was a joint venture, Indian laws restricted foreign ownership to only 30% of the company, which meant that 70% of the company belonged to Kiran Mazumdar Shaw.<ref name=Forbes2004>{{cite news|title=Big Shot in Bengaluru|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2004/1018/088.html|accessdate=18 September 2014|work=Forbes|date=18 October 2004}}</ref>

Initially, she faced credibility challenges because of her youth, gender and her untested business model. She was unable to secure funding for her company at the early stages of her business. A chance meeting with a banker at a social event finally enabled her to get her first financial backing.<ref name=Breaking /><ref name=Pota /><ref name=Leading /> She also found it difficult to recruit people to work for her start-up, her first employee was a retired garage mechanic <ref name=WomenInChemistryTranscript /> and her first factory was in a nearby 3,000-square-foot shed.<ref name=Breaking /> The most complicated piece of equipment in her lab at that time was a [[spectrophotometer]].<ref name=HistoryLive2014>{{cite web|title=History Live: Building a Global Biotech Enterprise|url=http://vimeo.com/channels/chfinterviews/96252872|publisher=Science History Institute|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref> Moreover, she faced the technological challenges associated with trying to build a biotech business in a country with poor infrastructure.<ref name=Breaking />{{rp|156}}<ref name=Pota />{{rp|114}} Uninterrupted power, good quality water, sterile labs, imported research equipment, and workers with advanced scientific skills were not easily available in India at that period of time.<ref name=CNN2008>{{cite news|title=Quiz India's mother of invention|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/14/india.mazumdarshaw/index.html?iref=newssearch|accessdate=22 September 2014|work=CNN/Asia|date=28 November 2008}}</ref>

The company's initial projects were the extraction of [[papain]] (an enzyme from papaya used to tenderize meat) and [[isinglass]] (obtained from tropical catfish and used to clarify beer).<ref name=Pota /> Within a year of its inception, Biocon India was able to manufacture enzymes and export them to the U.S. and Europe, the first Indian company to do so.<ref name=Breaking /> At the end of her first year, Mazumdar used her earnings to buy a 20-acre property with plans to expand in the future.<ref name=WomenInChemistryTranscript />

=== Expanding into biopharmaceuticals ===

Mazumdar spearheaded Biocon's evolution from an industrial enzymes manufacturing company to a fully integrated bio-pharmaceutical company with a well-balanced business portfolio of products and a research focus on diabetes, oncology and auto-immune diseases.<ref name=Bloomberg>{{cite web|title=Need To Change Mindset: Kiran Mazumdar Shaw|url=http://www.btvin.com/videos/watch/6569/need-to-change-mindset:-kiran-mazumdar-shaw|publisher=Bloomberg TV}}</ref><ref name="ForbesProfile">{{cite web|title=Power Women #92 Kiran Mazumdar Shaw|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/kiran-mazumdar-shaw/|work=Forbes|date=October 2013}}</ref> She also established two subsidiaries: Syngene (1994) which provides early research and development support services on a contract basis and Clinigene (2000) which focuses on clinical research trials and the development of both generic and new medicines. Clinigene was later merged with Syngene.

In 1984, Kiran began to develop a research and development team at Biocon, focusing on the discovery of novel enzymes and on development of novel techniques for [[solid substrate fermentation]] technology.<ref name=Ghose>{{cite book|last1=Ghose|first1=T.K.|last2=Ghosh|first2=P.|title=Biotechnology in India|date=2003|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-00563-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-UsrSQrRI4C&pg=PA33|accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref> The company's first major expansion came in 1987, when [[Narayanan Vaghul]] of [[ICICI Bank|ICICI Ventures]] supported creation of a venture capital fund of US$250,000.<ref name=Leading /> This money enabled Biocon to expand its research and development efforts. They built a new plant featuring proprietary solid substrate fermentation technology based on a semi-automated tray culture process, inspired by Japanese techniques.<ref name=Breaking /><ref name=Leading /><ref name=Ghose /> In 1989, Biocon became the first Indian biotech company to receive U.S. funding for proprietary technologies.<ref name=Breaking />

In 1990, Mazumdar incorporated Biocon Biopharmaceuticals Private Limited (BBLP) to manufacture and market a select range of biotherapeutics in a joint venture with the Cuban [[Center of Molecular Immunology]].<ref name=Breaking />

=== Establishing independence ===
Biocon Biochemicals of Ireland was acquired from Leslie Auchincloss by [[Unilever]] in 1989.<ref name=Fernando>{{cite book|last1=Fernando|first1=A.C.|title=Business Ethics An Indian Perspective.|date=2009|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Chennai|isbn=978-8131711736|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-k_uWkGCEUC&pg=PA50|accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref>{{rp|50}} The partnership with Unilever helped Biocon to establish global best practices and quality systems.<ref name=HistoryLive2014 /> In 1997, Unilever sold its specialty chemicals division, including Biocon, to [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI).<ref name=Forbes2004 /> In 1998, Kiran Mazumdar's fiancée, Scotsman John Shaw, personally raised $2 million to purchase the outstanding Biocon shares from ICI.<ref name=Leading /><ref name=Hiscock>{{cite book|last1=Hiscock|first1=Geoff|title=India's global wealth club : the stunning rise of its billionaires and the secrets of their success|date=2008|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0-470-82238-8|page=226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YiLBD_IpgIkC&pg=PA225|accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref> The couple married in 1998, whereupon she became known as Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw.

In 2004, after seeking the advice of [[N. R. Narayana Murthy|Narayana Murthy]], Mazumdar-Shaw decided to list Biocon on the stock market.<ref name=Leading /> Her intent was to raise capital to further develop Biocon's research programs. Biocon was the first biotechnology company in India to issue an [[IPO]].<ref name=Breaking />{{rp|159}} Biocon's IPO was oversubscribed 33 times and its first day at the bourses and closed with a market value of $1.11 billion,<ref name=Breaking /> making Biocon the second Indian company to cross the $1-billion mark on the first day of listing.<ref name=Estudio>{{cite web|title=India: Biocon|url=http://estudioagml.com.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=207:india-biocon&catid=1:actualidad&Itemid=72|website=Estudio AGML|accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref>

=== Affordable innovation ===
Mazumdar-Shaw's belief in "affordable innovation" has always been a driving philosophy behind Biocon's expansion. Inspired by the need for [[affordable drugs]] in less-wealthy countries, she has looked for opportunities to develop cost-effective techniques and low-cost alternatives.<ref name=Estudio /><ref name=Scitable>{{cite journal|last1=Weidmann|first1=Bhavana|title=Healthcare Innovation: An Interview with Dr. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw|journal=Scitable by Nature Education|date=4 January 2014|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/blog/the-success-code/healthcare_innovation_an_interview_with|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> She has also proposed that drug companies be cost-sensitive in marketing to developing countries, so that people can afford the drugs they need, particularly chronic therapies.<ref name=Breaking /><ref name=Scitable />

Mazumdar-Shaw noticed the market potential for [[statins]] (cholesterol fighting drugs) early on. When the patent of the cholesterol-lowering drug [[lovastatin]] expired in 2001, Biocon got involved in its development. Then the company expanded to other forms of statins. Part of her strategy was to enter into long-term supply contracts, establishing a dependable market base over time. Statins soon accounted for over 50 per cent of the company's revenue. The company’s revenue went up from ₹70 crore in 1998, to ₹500 crore in 2004 when it went public.<ref name=Estudio />

Biocon continues to expand into new areas. [[Yeast expression platforms]] offer a desirable alternative to mammalian [[cell cultures]] for the genetic manipulation of cells for use in a variety of drug treatments. Unicellular methylotrophic yeasts such as [[Pichia pastoris]] are used in the production of [[vaccines]], [[antibody fragment]]s, [[hormones]], [[cytokines]], matrix proteins, and [[biosimilar]]s.<ref name=Rios>{{cite journal|last1=Rios|first1=Maribel|title=A Decade of Microbial Fermentation|journal=BioProcess International|date=1 June 2012|url=http://www.bioprocessintl.com/upstream-processing/fermentation/a-decade-of-microbial-fermentation-331179/|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>

Biocon's major areas of research now include cancer, [[diabetes]], and other [[Autoimmune disease|auto-immune diseases]] such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[psoriasis]].<ref name=Leading /><ref name=psoriasis2013>{{cite news|title=Biocon to launch psoriasis drug novel biologic in July|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/biocon-to-launch-psoriasis-drug-novel-biologic-in-july/|accessdate=24 September 2014|work=The Indian Express|date=28 April 2013}}</ref> Because of the high percentage of people in India who chew [[betel]] or [[tobacco]], India accounts for eighty-six per cent of [[oral cancer]] in the world, known locally as "cancer cheek".<ref name=NewYorker2012 /><ref name=ForbesAsia20114 /> Diabetes is prevalent, and people who do not wear shoes are at risk to have a minor scrape or injury develop into [[gangrene]], or "diabetes foot".<ref name=NewYorker2012 /><ref name=ForbesAsia20114 /> Biocon is also working on drugs to treat [[psoriasis]], a skin pigment disease.<ref name=NewYorker2012 />

Bio-pharmaceuticals developed by the company include Pichia-derived recombinant human [[insulin]] and insulin analogs for diabetes, an anti-EGFR [[monoclonal antibody]] for head and neck cancer, and a [[Biologic medical product|biologic]] for psoriasis.<ref name="Scitable" /> Biocon is Asia's largest insulin producer,<ref name=keck>{{cite web|title=KGI Welcomes India's Leading Biotech Executive |url=http://www.kgi.edu/news-and-events/news-stories/2010/news-story-kgi-welcomes-india%E2%80%99s-leading-biotech-executive.html |accessdate=22 September 2014 |publisher=Keck Graduate Institute |date=11 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924041853/http://www.kgi.edu/news-and-events/news-stories/2010/news-story-kgi-welcomes-india%E2%80%99s-leading-biotech-executive.html |archivedate=24 September 2014 }}</ref> and has the largest perfusion-based antibody production facilities.<ref name=APBN2007>{{cite journal|title=A Woman's Dream Come True (Interview)|journal=Asia Pacific Biotech News|date=2007|volume=11|issue=14|pages=1011–1015|url=http://www.asiabiotech.com/publication/apbn/11/english/preserved-docs/1114/1011_1015.pdf|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref>

As of 2014, Biocon directed about 10% of its revenue into research and development, a much higher proportion than most Indian pharmacological companies.<ref name=ChangeMaestros /> Biocon has filed at least 950 patent applications based on its research activity.<ref name=ChangeMaestros /> Mazumdar-Shaw has remained actively engaged in acquisitions, partnerships and in-licensing in the pharmaceuticals and bio-pharmaceutical areas, entering into more than 2,200 high-value R&D licensing and other deals between 2005 and 2010.<ref name=Estudio />

== Philanthropic activities ==

In 2004, Mazumdar-Shaw started a corporate social responsibility wing at Biocon, the Biocon Foundation. The Foundation focuses on health, education and infrastructure, especially in rural areas of [[Karnataka]] which lack healthcare facilities.<ref name=Estudio />
