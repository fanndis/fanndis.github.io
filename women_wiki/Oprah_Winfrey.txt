==Early life==
Winfrey was born Orpah Gail Winfrey; her first name was spelled ''Orpah'' (not ''Oprah'') on her birth certificate after the [[Orpah|biblical figure]] in the [[Book of Ruth]], but people mispronounced it regularly and "Oprah" stuck.<ref name="AoA"/><ref name="A of A">Winfrey has said in interviews that "my name had been chosen from the Bible.

A [[genetic test]] in 2006 determined that her matrilineal line originated among the [[Kpelle people|Kpelle]] ethnic group, in the area that today is [[Liberia]]. Her genetic makeup was determined to be 89% Sub-Saharan African, 8% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], and 3% East Asian.

After Winfrey's birth, her mother traveled north, and Winfrey spent her first six years living in rural poverty with her maternal grandmother, Hattie Mae (Presley) Lee (April 15, 1900 – February 27, 1963).

At age six, Winfrey moved to an inner-city neighborhood in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], with her mother, who was less supportive and encouraging than her grandmother had been, largely as a result of the long hours she worked as a maid.<ref name=":2" /> Around this time, Lee had given birth to another daughter, Winfrey's younger half-sister, Patricia<ref name="Mair pg 12">Mair (1999) p. 12.</ref> who died of causes related to [[cocaine]] addiction in February 2003 at age 43.<ref name="Garson20">Garson, Helen S.

As a result, her mother once again sent her to live with Vernon in [[Nashville]], although this time she did not take her back. Vernon was strict but encouraging, and made her education a priority.

Winfrey's career in media would not have surprised her grandmother, who once said that ever since Winfrey could talk, she was on stage. As a child, she played games interviewing her corncob doll and the crows on the fence of her family's property. Winfrey later acknowledged her grandmother's influence, saying it was Hattie Mae who had encouraged her to speak in public and "gave me a positive sense of myself".<ref>Mel Novit.

Working in local media, she was both the youngest news anchor and the first black female news anchor at [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]'s [[WTVF-TV|WLAC-TV]]. In 1976, she moved to [[Baltimore]]'s [[WJZ-TV]] to co-anchor the six o'clock news. In 1977, she was removed as co-anchor and worked in lower profile positions at the station. She was then recruited to join [[Richard Sher (newscaster)|Richard Sher]] as co-host of WJZ's local talk show ''People Are Talking'', which premiered on August 14, 1978.

In 1983, Winfrey relocated to Chicago to host [[WLS-TV]]'s low-rated half-hour morning talk show, ''AM Chicago''. The first episode aired on January 2, 1984. Within months after Winfrey took over, the show went from last place in the ratings to overtaking ''[[The Phil Donahue Show|Donahue]]'' as the highest-rated talk show in Chicago. The movie critic [[Roger Ebert]] persuaded her to sign a syndication deal with [[King World]].

Their much-publicized contest was the subject of enormous scrutiny. ''TIME'' magazine wrote:
{{Pull quote|Few people would have bet on Oprah Winfrey's swift rise to host of the most popular talk show on TV. In a field dominated by white males, she is a black female of ample bulk. As interviewers go, she is no match for, say, Phil Donahue&nbsp;... What she lacks in journalistic toughness, she makes up for in plainspoken curiosity, robust humor and, above all empathy. Guests with sad stories to tell are apt to rouse a tear in Oprah's eye&nbsp;... They, in turn, often find themselves revealing things they would not imagine telling anyone, much less a national TV audience.

In the early years of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'', the program was classified as a tabloid talk show. In the mid-1990s, Winfrey began to host shows on broader topics such as heart disease, geopolitics, spirituality, and meditation. She interviewed celebrities on social issues they were directly involved with, such as cancer, charity work, or substance abuse, and hosted televised giveaways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/you-get-a-car-oprah-winfrey-giveaway-studio-audience-gift-tax-members-guests-pay-show-a8208051.html|title=Oprah once gave an entire audience free cars – but it turns out there was a hidden cost|date=February 13, 2018|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=December 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/sep/14/oprah-winfrey-australia-john-travolta|title=Oprah surprises her audience with a trip to Australia – on a plane flown by John Travolta|last=Benedictus|first=Leo|date=September 14, 2010|work=The Guardian|access-date=December 9, 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In later years Winfrey was criticized for allowing celebrities to make pseudoscientific claims on her show such as [[Jenny McCarthy]]'s unfounded assertions about vaccines, and [[Suzanne Somers]]'s promotion of bioidenticals.<ref>Mathis-Lilley, Ben (January 8, 2018).

In addition to her talk show, Winfrey also produced and co-starred in the 1989 drama miniseries [[The Women of Brewster Place (miniseries)|''The Women of Brewster Place'']] and a short-lived spin-off, ''Brewster Place''. As well as hosting and appearing on television shows, Winfrey co-founded the women's cable television network [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]] which was the initial network for her ''[[Oprah After the Show]]'' program from 2002 to 2006 before moving to Oprah.com when Winfrey sold her stake in the network. She is also the president of [[Harpo Productions]] (''Oprah'' spelled backwards). She also moderated three ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]''s from 1992 to 1994.

On January 15, 2008, Winfrey and [[Discovery Communications]] announced plans to change [[Discovery Health Channel]] into a new channel called ''[[Oprah Winfrey Network|OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network]]''.

In 2006, rappers [[Ludacris]], [[50 Cent]], and [[Ice Cube]] criticized Winfrey for what they perceived as an anti-[[hip hop music|hip hop]] bias. In an interview with ''[[GQ]]'' magazine, Ludacris said that Winfrey gave him a "hard time" about his lyrics, and edited comments he made during an appearance on her show with the cast of the film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]''.

===Film===
In 1985, Winfrey co-starred in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'' as distraught housewife [[The Color Purple#Sofia|Sofia]]. She was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance. The [[Alice Walker]] novel went on to become [[The Color Purple (musical)|a Broadway musical]] which opened in late 2005, with Winfrey credited as a producer. In October 1998, Winfrey produced and starred in the film ''[[Beloved (1998 film)|Beloved]]'', based on [[Toni Morrison]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[Beloved (novel)|novel of the same name]]. To prepare for her role as Sethe, the protagonist and former slave, Winfrey experienced a 24-hour simulation of the experience of slavery, which included being tied up and blindfolded and left alone in the woods. Despite major advertising, including two episodes of her [[The Oprah Winfrey Show|talk show]] dedicated solely to the film, and moderate to good critical reviews, ''Beloved'' opened to poor box-office results, losing approximately $30&nbsp;million. While promoting the movie, co-star [[Thandie Newton]] described Winfrey as "a very strong technical actress and it's because she's so smart. She's acute. She's got a mind like a razor blade."<ref>''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' October 1998</ref> In 2005, [[Harpo Productions]] released a film adaptation of [[Zora Neale Hurston]]'s 1937 novel ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]''.

==Personal life==

===Homes===
[[File:OprahEstate.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Oprah's [[Montecito, California|Montecito]] estate]]
Winfrey currently lives on "The Promised Land", her 42-acre (17-ha) estate with ocean and mountain views in [[Montecito, California]]. Winfrey also owns a house in [[Lavallette, New Jersey]]; an apartment in Chicago; an estate on [[Fisher Island, Florida]]; a ski house in [[Telluride, Colorado]]; and properties on [[Maui]], [[Hawaii]]; [[Antigua]]; and [[Orcas Island]], Washington State.

===Romantic history===
Winfrey's high school sweetheart Anthony Otey recalled an innocent courtship that began in Winfrey's senior year of high school, from which he saved hundreds of love notes; Winfrey conducted herself with dignity and was a model student.<ref name="Mair pg 28-29">Mair (1999), pp. 28–29.</ref> The two spoke of getting married, but Otey claimed to have always secretly known that Winfrey was destined for a far greater life than he could ever provide.<ref name="Mair pg 30">Mair (1999) p. 30</ref> She broke up with him on Valentine's Day of her senior year.<ref name="Mair pg 30" /><ref name="Mair pg 31">Mair (1999), p. 31.</ref>

In 1971, several months after breaking up with Otey, Winfrey met William "Bubba" Taylor at Tennessee State University. According to CBS journalist George Mair, Taylor was Winfrey's "first intense, to die for love affair". Winfrey helped get Taylor a job at WVOL, and according to Mair, "did everything to keep him, including literally begging him on her knees to stay with her."<ref name="Mair pg 33">Mair (1999) p. 33</ref> Taylor, however, was unwilling to leave Nashville with Winfrey when she moved to Baltimore to work at WJZ-TV in June 1976. "We really did care for each other", Winfrey would later recall. "We shared a deep love. A love I will never forget."<ref name="Mair pg 43">Mair (1999), p. 43.</ref>

In the 1970s, Winfrey had a romantic relationship with [[John Tesh]]. Biographer [[Kitty Kelley]] claims that Tesh split with Winfrey over the pressures of an interracial relationship.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/04/12/oprah-john-tesh-briefly-dated-lived-toger-new-book-claims/?test=faces|publisher=Fox News Channel|title=Oprah and John Tesh Briefly Dated, Lived Together, New Book Claims|date=April 12, 2010}}</ref>

When WJZ-TV management criticized Winfrey for crying on air while reporting tragedies and were unhappy with her physical appearance (especially when her hair fell out as a result of a bad perm), Winfrey turned to reporter Lloyd Kramer for comfort. "Lloyd was just the best", Winfrey would later recall. "That man loved me even when I was bald! He was wonderful. He stuck with me through the whole demoralizing experience. That man was the most fun romance I ever had."<ref name="Mair pg 47">{{cite book|last=Mair|first=George|title=Oprah Winfrey: The Real Story|page=[https://archive.org/details/oprahwinfreyreal00mair/page/47 47]|year=1995|publisher=Carol Pub. Group|isbn=1-55972-250-9|url=https://archive.org/details/oprahwinfreyreal00mair/page/47}}</ref>

According to Mair, when Kramer moved to NBC in New York, Winfrey had a love affair with a married man who had no intention of leaving his wife.<ref>Mair (1999), p. 49: "the major problem with this intense love affair arose from her lover's being married, with no plans to leave his wife".</ref> Winfrey would later recall: "I'd had a relationship with a man for four years. I wasn't living with him. I'd never lived with anyone—and I thought I was worthless without him. The more he rejected me, the more I wanted him. I felt depleted, powerless. At the end, I was down on the floor on my knees groveling and pleading with him".<ref name="Mair pg 49"/> Winfrey became so depressed that on September 8, 1981, she wrote a suicide note to best friend [[Gayle King]] instructing King to water her plants.<ref name="Mair pg 49">Mair (1999), p. 49.</ref> "That suicide note had been much overplayed" Winfrey told ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine. "I couldn't kill myself. I would be afraid the minute I did it, something really good would happen and I'd miss it."<ref Name="Mair p50">Mair (1999), p. 50.</ref>

According to Winfrey, her emotional turmoil gradually led to a weight problem: "The reason I gained so much weight in the first place and the reason I had such a sorry history of abusive relationships with men was I just needed approval so much. I needed everyone to like me, because I didn't like myself much. So I'd end up with these cruel self-absorbed guys who'd tell me how selfish I was, and I'd say 'Oh thank you, you're so right' and be grateful to them. Because I had no sense that I deserved anything else. Which is also why I gained so much weight later on. It was the perfect way of cushioning myself against the world's disapproval."<ref Name="Mair p50"/>

Winfrey later confessed to smoking [[crack cocaine]] with a man she was romantically involved with during the same era. She explained on her show: "I always felt that the drug itself is not the problem but that I was addicted to the man." She added: "I can't think of anything I wouldn't have done for that man."<ref name="Jet">{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n12_v87/ai_16404541 |title=Oprah reveals on her show she smoked crack cocaine during her 20s |work=Jet |date=January 30, 1995 |accessdate=August 25, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208105953/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n12_v87/ai_16404541 |archive-date=December 8, 2008 }} Archived at FindArticles in 2004.</ref>

Winfrey was allegedly involved in a second drug-related love affair. Self-proclaimed former boyfriend Randolph Cook said they lived together for several months in 1985 and did drugs. In 1997, Cook tried to sue Winfrey for $20&nbsp;million for allegedly blocking a [[tell-all book]] about their alleged relationship.<ref name="FindLaw">{{cite court|litigants=Randolph L.

In the mid-1980s, Winfrey briefly dated movie critic [[Roger Ebert]], whom she credits with advising her to take her show into syndication.<ref name="Ebert-How"/>

In 1985, before Winfrey's Chicago talk show had gone national, Haitian filmmaker Reginald Chevalier claims he appeared as a guest on a look-alike segment and began a relationship with Winfrey involving romantic evenings at home, candlelit baths, and dinners with [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Danny Glover]]. Chevalier says Winfrey ended the relationship when she met [[Stedman Graham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/02/exclusive-interview-stedman-stole-oprah-me-secret-lover-tells-radar|title=EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Stedman Stole Oprah From Me, Secret Lover Tells Radar|date=February 17, 2011|publisher=radaronline.com|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref>

Winfrey and her boyfriend Stedman Graham have been together since 1986. They were engaged to be married in November 1992, but the ceremony never took place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oprah.about.com/od/oprahbiography/p/personallife.htm|title=A Look Into the Personal Life of Oprah Winfrey|publisher=Oprah.about.com|date=November 14, 2008|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>

===Close friends===
[[File:Oprah Winfrey (2004).jpg|alt=|thumb|Winfrey celebrating her 50th birthday among friends at her Santa Barbara estate, 2004]]
Winfrey's best friend since their early twenties is [[Gayle King]]. King was formerly the host of ''The Gayle King Show'' and is currently an editor of ''O, the Oprah Magazine''. Since 1997, when Winfrey played the therapist on an episode of the sitcom ''Ellen'' in which [[Ellen DeGeneres]] came out of the closet, Winfrey and King have been the target of persistent rumors that they were gay. "I understand why people think we're gay", Winfrey says in the August 2006 issue of ''O'' magazine. "There isn't a definition in our culture for this kind of bond between women. So I get why people have to label it—how can you be this close without it being sexual?"<ref name="Not Gay">{{cite web|last=Lehner |first=Marla |title=Oprah: Gayle and I Are Not Gay |work=People |date=July 18, 2006 |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,1215402,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421013629/http://www.people.com/people/article/0%2C26334%2C1215402%2C00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 21, 2007 |accessdate=August 25, 2008 }}</ref> "I've told nearly everything there is to tell.

===Personal wealth===
Born in rural poverty, and raised by a mother dependent on government welfare payments in a poor urban neighborhood, Winfrey became a millionaire at the age of 32 when her talk show received national syndication. Winfrey negotiated ownership rights to the television program and started her own production company.

Oprah was raised a [[Baptist]].

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' coined the term "Oprahfication", meaning public confession as a form of therapy.<ref Name="Church of O">[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/april1/1.38.html "The Church of O"], ''Christianity Today'' April 1, 2002. Retrieved August 26, 2010.</ref> By confessing intimate details about her weight problems, tumultuous love life, and sexual abuse, and crying alongside her guests, Winfrey has been credited by ''Time'' magazine with creating a new form of media communication known as "rapport talk" as distinguished from the "report talk" of Phil Donahue: "Winfrey saw television's power to blend public and private; while it links strangers and conveys information over public airwaves, TV is most often viewed in the privacy of our homes. Like a family member, it sits down to meals with us and talks to us in the lonely afternoons. Grasping this paradox, ...&nbsp;She makes people care because she cares. That is Winfrey's genius, and will be her legacy, as the changes she has wrought in the talk show continue to permeate our culture and shape our lives."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988512-2,00.html "The TV Host"], ''Time'', June 8, 1998.

The November 1988 ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' observed that "in a society where fat is taboo, she made it in a medium that worships thin and celebrates a bland, white-bread prettiness of body and personality [...] But Winfrey made fat sexy, elegant&nbsp;– damned near gorgeous&nbsp;– with her drop-dead wardrobe, easy body language, and cheerful sensuality."<ref>Kelley, Kitty.

====Mainstream acceptance of LGBT people====
While [[Phil Donahue]] has been credited with pioneering the tabloid talk show genre, Winfrey's warmth, intimacy, and personal confession popularized and changed it.<ref name="TIME 100 1998" /><ref name="Coming Afer Oprah">{{cite press release|title=Coming After Oprah |publisher=Dr. Leonard Mustazza |url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/l/x/lxm7/oprah.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030625111121/http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/l/x/lxm7/oprah.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 25, 2003 |accessdate=August 25, 2008 }}</ref> Her success at popularizing the tabloid talk show genre opened up a thriving industry that has included ''[[Ricki Lake (TV series)|Ricki Lake]]'', ''[[The Jenny Jones Show]]'', and ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]''. Sociologists such as Vicki Abt criticized tabloid talk shows for redefining social norms. In her book ''Coming After Oprah: Cultural Fallout in the Age of the TV talk show'', Abt warned that the media revolution that followed Winfrey's success was blurring the lines between "normal" and "deviant" behavior. In the book ''Freaks Talk Back'',<ref name="FTB UCPress">{{cite web|title=An interview and excerpt from Freaks Talk Back|publisher=University of Chicago Press|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/280640.html|accessdate =August 25, 2008}}</ref> Yale sociology professor [[Joshua Gamson]] credits the tabloid talk show genre with providing much needed high impact media visibility for gay, [[bisexual]], [[transsexual]], and [[transgender]] (LGBT) people and doing more to make them mainstream and socially acceptable than any other development of the 20th century. In the book's editorial review, [[Michael Bronski]] wrote, "In the recent past, lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgendered people had almost no presence on television. With the invention and propagation of tabloid talk shows such as ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|Jerry Springer]]'', ''[[The Jenny Jones Show|Jenny Jones]]'', ''Oprah'', and ''[[Geraldo Rivera|Geraldo]]'', people outside the sexual mainstream now appear in living rooms across America almost every day of the week."<ref name="FTP Amazon">Gamson, Joshua (1999) University Of Chicago Press {{ISBN|0-226-28065-9}}</ref> Gamson credits the tabloid talk show with making alternative sexual orientations and identities more acceptable in mainstream society. Examples include a ''Time'' magazine article{{page needed|date=January 2017}} on early 21st-century gays coming out of the closet at an increasingly younger age and on plummeting [[Suicide among LGBT youth|gay suicide]] rates. Gamson also believes that tabloid talk shows caused gays to be accepted on more traditional forms of media.

In April 1997, Winfrey played the therapist in "[[The Puppy Episode]]" on the sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' to whom the character (and the real-life [[Ellen DeGeneres]]) said she was a lesbian.

The segment focused on new books and classics and often brought obscure novels to popular attention. The book club became such a powerful force that whenever Winfrey introduced a new book as her book-club selection, it instantly became a best-seller; for example, when she selected the classic [[John Steinbeck]] novel ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', it soared to the top of the book charts. Being recognized by Winfrey often means a million additional book sales for an author.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/23/books/23oprah.html?scp=1&sq=%22oprah%27s+book+club%22&st=nyt "Oprah's Book Club to Add Contemporary Writers"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' article.

In 2007, Winfrey began to endorse the self-help program ''[[The Secret (2006 film)|The Secret]]''. ''The Secret'' claims that people can change their lives through positive thoughts or 'vibrations', which will then cause them to attract more positive vibrations that result in good things happening to them.

In 1998, Winfrey created the [[Oprah's Angel Network]], a charity that supported charitable projects and provided grants to nonprofit organizations around the world. Oprah's Angel Network raised more than $80,000,000 ($1&nbsp;million of which was donated by [[Jon Bon Jovi]]). Winfrey personally covered all administrative costs associated with the charity, so 100% of all funds raised went to charity programs. In May 2010, with Oprah's show ending, the charity stopped accepting donations and was shut down.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/26/oprah-winfreys-angel-netw_n_590941.html|title=Oprah Winfrey's Angel Network Charity To Close Down|date=May 26, 2010|work=HuffPost|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529175959/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/26/oprah-winfreys-angel-netw_n_590941.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 29, 2010|access-date=February 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oprahsangelnetwork.org/how-to-help/thank-you-donors|title=How to Help – Thank You to Our Donors|date=May 24, 2010|publisher=Opera's Angel Network|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809132838/http://oprahsangelnetwork.org/how-to-help/thank-you-donors|archive-date=August 9, 2011|access-date=February 24, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Oprah created the Oprah Angel Network Katrina registry which raised more than $11&nbsp;million for relief efforts. Winfrey personally gave $10&nbsp;million to the cause.<ref name="LAStarz">{{cite web|last=Mirabella|first=Linda|title=Cash Donations, Benefit Concerts, Celebrity Auctions and Celebrity Volunteers to Benefit Victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita|publisher=LAStarz|url=http://www.la-starz.com/HurricaneKatrina_CelebrityEfforts.html|access-date=August 25, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622181458/http://www.la-starz.com/HurricaneKatrina_CelebrityEfforts.html|archive-date=June 22, 2008}}</ref> Homes were built in Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama before the one-year anniversary of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/article/angelnetwork/uyl_katrina_main/1|title=Building Oprah Katrina Homes|publisher=Oprah.com|date=January 15, 2006|access-date=August 26, 2010}}</ref>

====South Africa====
{{Main|Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls}}
In 2004, Winfrey and her team filmed an episode of her show, ''Oprah's Christmas Kindness'', in which Winfrey travelled to South Africa to bring attention to the plight of young children affected by poverty and AIDS. During the 21-day trip, Winfrey and her crew visited schools and orphanages in poverty-stricken areas, and distributed Christmas presents to 50,000 children,<ref Name="Christmas Kindness">{{cite web|title=Christmas Kindness|publisher=Harpo Productions|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/ChristmasKindness-Inspiration|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref> with dolls for the girls and soccer balls for the boys, and school supplies. Throughout the show, Winfrey appealed to viewers to donate money to Oprah's Angel Network for poor and AIDS-affected children in Africa. From that show alone, viewers around the world donated over $7,000,000. Winfrey invested $40&nbsp;million and some of her time establishing the [[Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls]] in [[Henley on Klip]] south of [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. The school set over 22 acres, opened in January 2007 with an enrollment of 150 pupils (increasing to 450) and features state-of-the-art classrooms, computer and science laboratories, a library, theatre, and beauty salon. [[Nelson Mandela]] praised Winfrey for overcoming her own disadvantaged youth to become a benefactor for others. Critics considered the school elitist and unnecessarily luxurious.<ref name=timesonline>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1288597.ece|location=London|work=The Times|first1=Elsa|last1=McLaren|title=Oprah Winfrey opens school for poor South African girls|date=January 2, 2007}}</ref> Winfrey rejected the claims, saying: "If you are surrounded by beautiful things and wonderful teachers who inspire you, that beauty brings out the beauty in you."<ref name=timesonline /> Winfrey, who has no surviving biological children, described maternal feelings towards the girls at Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls.<ref Name="Samuels">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2007/01/07/oprah-goes-to-school.html|title=Oprah goes to school|last=Samuels|first=Allison|work=Newsweek|date=January 8, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913121426/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2007/01/07/oprah-goes-to-school.html|archive-date=September 13, 2011|access-date=May 27, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Jeff Koinange|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/01/05/btsc.koinange/index.html|title=CNN.com|publisher=CNN|date=January 8, 2007|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref> Winfrey teaches a class at the school via satellite.<ref Name="Samuels"/>
