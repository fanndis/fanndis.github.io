'''Tsai Ing-wen''' (<!--Do not add Chinese characters. See infobox-->born 31 August 1956) is a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] [[politician]] and academic serving as the seventh [[president of the Republic of China (Taiwan)]], since 2016. A member of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], Tsai is the first female president of Taiwan. She has served as [[List of leaders of the Democratic Progressive Party|Chair of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)]] since 2020, and previously from 2008 to 2012 and 2014 to 2018.

Tsai studied [[law]] and [[international trade]], and later became a [[Jurist|law professor]] at [[Soochow University School of Law]] and [[National Chengchi University]] after earning an [[LLB]] from [[National Taiwan University]], an [[LLM]] from [[Cornell Law School]]. She later studied law at [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] and was awarded [[Ph.D.]] in law from [[University of London]]. In 1993, as an independent (without party affiliation), she was appointed to a series of governmental positions, including trade negotiator for [[WTO]] affairs, by the then-ruling [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and was one of the chief drafters of the [[special state-to-state relations]] doctrine of then [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Lee Teng-hui]].

After DPP President [[Chen Shui-bian]] took office in 2000, Tsai served as Minister of the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] throughout Chen's first term as a non-partisan. She joined the DPP in 2004 and served briefly as a DPP-nominated at-large member of the [[Legislative Yuan]]. From there, she was appointed Vice Premier under [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] [[Su Tseng-chang]] until the [[Executive Yuan|cabinet]]'s mass resignation in 2007. She was elected and assumed DPP leadership in 2008, following her party's defeat in the [[2008 Taiwan presidential election|2008 presidential election]]. She resigned as chair after losing the [[2012 Taiwanese presidential election|2012 presidential election]].

Tsai ran for [[New Taipei City]] [[Mayor of New Taipei City|mayor]]ship in the November 2010 [[2010 Republic of China municipal elections|municipal elections]] but was defeated by another former vice premier, [[Eric Chu]] (KMT). In April 2011, Tsai became the first female presidential candidate of a major party in the history of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] after defeating her former superior, Su Tseng-chang, in the DPP's primary by a slight margin. She was defeated by incumbent Kuomintang candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] in the 5th direct presidential election in 2012, but was elected by a [[landslide victory|landslide]] four years later in the [[2016 Taiwanese presidential election|sixth direct presidential election in 2016]]. Tsai is the second President from the Democratic Progressive Party. She is the first President to have never held an elected executive post before serving as President and the first to be popularly elected without having previously served as the [[Mayor of Taipei]]. Tsai was re-elected as President with an increased share of the vote in the [[2020 Taiwanese presidential election|2020 presidential election]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/01/11/795573457/rebuking-china-taiwan-votes-to-reelect-president-tsai-ing-wen|title=Rebuking China, Taiwan Votes To Reelect President Tsai Ing-wen|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref>

==Rise in politics==
In 2000, Tsai was given the high-profile appointment of chair of the [[Mainland Affairs Council]]. Confirming the widely held belief that she maintained [[Pan-Green Coalition|Pan-Green]] sympathies, Tsai joined the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) in 2004.<ref name=tnprofile/> She was subsequently nominated by the DPP to be a candidate in the [[2004 Republic of China legislative election|2004 legislative election]] and was elected as a legislator-at-large.

On 26 January 2006, Tsai was appointed to the post of vice president of the [[Executive Yuan]], a position commonly referred to as vice premier.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Chuang |first1=Jimmy |title=Premier Su enjoys busy first morning in his new office |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/01/27/2003290913 |accessdate=24 July 2020 |work=Taipei Times |date=26 January 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Tsai Ing-wen confirmed as Su deputy |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2006/01/21/2003290001 |accessdate=24 July 2020 |work=Taipei Times |date=21 January 2006}}</ref> She concurrently served as chairwoman of the [[Consumer Protection Commission]].

On 17 May 2007, Tsai, along with the rest of the cabinet of out-going [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] [[Su Tseng-chang]], resigned to make way for incoming [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier]] [[Chang Chun-hsiung]] and his cabinet. Premier Chang named [[Chiou I-jen]], the incumbent secretary-general of the [[President of the Republic of China|Presidential Office]] to replace Tsai as vice premier.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/archives/front/2007517/109921.htm |title=Taiwan's new premier picks tough strategist as deputy in limited Cabinet reshuffle |publisher=[[The China Post]] |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=22 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194836/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/archives/front/2007517/109921.htm |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=live  }}</ref> She then served as the chair of TaiMedBiologics, a [[biotechnology]] company based in Taiwan.

In Kuomintang candidate Ma Ying-jeou's search for his running mate for the [[2008 Republic of China presidential election|2008 ROC presidential election]], Tsai, a DPP member, was surprisingly suggested. Ma stated that there were no set criteria for a running mate, that his search would not be defined by gender, occupation, or even political party affiliations.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:又傳創意組合　蔡英文會是馬英九副手搭檔？ |url=http://hk.crntt.com/doc/1003/7/9/9/100379928.html?coluid=7&kindid=0&docid=100379928 |accessdate=4 January 2015 |work=China Review News |publisher=crntt.com |date=1 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104032844/http://hk.crntt.com/doc/1003/7/9/9/100379928.html?coluid=7&kindid=0&docid=100379928 |archive-date=4 January 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

On 19 May 2008, Tsai defeated [[Koo Kwang-ming]] in the [[2008 Democratic Progressive Party chairmanship election|election for DPP chair]], and succeeded outgoing [[Frank Hsieh]] as the 12th-term chair of the party. She was the first woman to chair a major Taiwanese political party.

She said that DPP would work to deepen the [[Taiwanese localization movement]] while defending social justice. She criticized Ma for mentioning closer [[Cross-Strait relations]] but nothing about Taiwan's sovereignty and national security.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/05/22/2003412588 |title=New DPP chief bothered by what Ma did not say |accessdate=22 May 2008 |date=22 May 2008 |publisher=[[Taipei Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529210450/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/05/22/2003412588 |archive-date=29 May 2008 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

Tsai questioned Ma's stand on Taiwan's sovereign status. Ma emphasized the importance of the so-called [[1992 Consensus]] and called Tsai a [[Taiwan independence]] extremist. Tsai criticized Ma's government for not answering her question and labeling others.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/06/04/2003413779 |title=Tsai rejects independence criticism |date=4 June 2008 |accessdate=3 June 2008 |publisher=[[Taipei Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606125327/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/06/04/2003413779 |archive-date=6 June 2008 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

On 25 April 2010, Tsai participated in a televised [[ECFA TV Debate|debate]] against President and Kuomintang chairman [[Ma Ying-jeou]] over a proposed trade agreement, the [[Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement]] (ECFA); while President Ma believed ECFA would increase Taiwanese exports to mainland China and lower [[unemployment rate]]s, Tsai said it "will force Taiwan to open up for cheap Chinese exports eventually" and certain domestic industries will be harmed by the mainland trade invasion. Tsai also said that the pact "will make Taiwan lose its independence in cross-strait relations and become a Chinese parasite" and that Taiwan should negotiate with China under the multilateral-framework [[World Trade Organization]], which would offer more trade protections and emphasize Taiwan's distinct status.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9FA3LH80.htm |title=Taiwan president and opposition debate China deal |accessdate=25 April 2010 |date=25 April 2010 |publisher=[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428230750/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9FA3LH80.htm |archive-date=28 April 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

Afterwards, she indicated there had been no major "policy shift".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-china-tsai-idUSKBN13V1T7|title=Taiwan's Tsai: no major policy shifts, despite Trump call – reports|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|work=Reuters|date=6 December 2016|access-date=2 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819033708/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-china-tsai-idUSKBN13V1T7|archive-date=19 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Cross-strait relations===
[[File:2016年5月20日總統就職 10.jpg|thumb|Member of the House of Representatives of Japan [[Keiji Furuya]] and President Tsai, 20 May 2016]]
The DPP's traditional position on the issue of [[cross-strait relations]] is that the Republic of China, widely known as Taiwan, is already an independent state governing the territories of [[Kinmen]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], [[Penghu Islands]], and the island of Taiwan, thus rendering a formal declaration of independence unnecessary. While Tsai has never departed fundamentally from the party line, her personal approach to the issue is nuanced and evolving.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

During the 2012 presidential election cycle, Tsai said that she disagreed with the [[1992 Consensus]] as the basis for negotiations between Taiwan and mainland China, that such a consensus only served to buttress the "[[One China Principle]]", and that "no such consensus exists" because the majority of the Taiwanese public does not necessarily agree with this consensus. She believed that broad consultations should be held at all levels of Taiwanese society to decide the basis on which to advance negotiations with Beijing, dubbed the "[[Taiwan consensus]]". During the 2016 election cycle, Tsai was notably more moderate, making "maintaining the status quo" the centerpiece of party policy. She vowed to work within the Republic of China governing framework in addition to preserving the progress made in cross-strait relations by previous governments, while preserving "freedom and democracy" for the residents of Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://udn.com/news/story/7983/827842-%E8%94%A1%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%EF%BC%9A%E5%85%A9%E5%B2%B8%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%E5%8E%9F%E5%89%87-%E7%B6%AD%E6%8C%81%E7%8F%BE%E7%8B%80|script-title=zh:蔡英文：兩岸基本原則 維持現狀|website=udn.com|access-date=22 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823071607/http://udn.com/news/story/7983/827842-%E8%94%A1%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%EF%BC%9A%E5%85%A9%E5%B2%B8%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%E5%8E%9F%E5%89%87-%E7%B6%AD%E6%8C%81%E7%8F%BE%E7%8B%80|archive-date=23 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Tsai believes in the importance of economic and trade links with mainland China, but publicly spoke out against the [[Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement]] (ECFA), a preferential trade agreement that increased economic links between Taiwan and mainland China. She generally supports the diversification of Taiwan's economic partners.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In response to the death of Chinese [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Liu Xiaobo]], who died of organ failure while in government custody, Tsai pleaded with the Communist government to "show confidence in engaging in political reform so that the Chinese can enjoy the God-given rights of freedom and democracy".<ref>"[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2102682/how-world-leaders-reacted-liu-xiaobos-death World leaders call for release of Liu Xiaobo's widow] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714221947/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2102682/how-world-leaders-reacted-liu-xiaobos-death |date=14 July 2018 }}".

Tsai has accused the [[50 Cent Party|Communist Party of China's troll army]] of spreading [[fake news]] via social media to influence voters and support candidates more sympathetic to Beijing ahead of the [[2018 Taiwanese local elections]].<ref>{{cite news |title='Fake news' rattles Taiwan ahead of elections |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/news-rattles-taiwan-elections-181123005140173.html |work=Al-Jazeera |date=23 November 2018 |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214075425/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/news-rattles-taiwan-elections-181123005140173.html |archive-date=14 December 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Analysis: 'Fake news' fears grip Taiwan ahead of local polls |url=https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/c200fqlq |publisher=BBC Monitoring |date=21 November 2018 |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214164847/https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/c200fqlq |archive-date=14 December 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Fake news: How China is interfering in Taiwanese democracy and what to do about it |url=https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3580979 |work=Taiwan News |date=23 November 2018 |access-date=14 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214213851/https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3580979 |archive-date=14 December 2018 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

In January 2019, [[Xi Jinping]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]], had announced an open letter to Taiwan proposing a [[one country, two systems]] formula for eventual unification. Tsai responded to Xi in a January 2019 speech by stating that Taiwan rejects "[[one country, two systems]]" and that because Beijing equates the [[1992 Consensus]] with "one country, two systems", Taiwan rejects the 1992 Consensus as well.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/world/asia/taiwan-xi-jinping-tsai-ing-wen.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 5, 2019|last=Horton|first=Chris|title=Taiwan’s President, Defying Xi Jinping, Calls Unification Offer ‘Impossible’|access-date=January 18, 2019}}</ref>

Tsai expressed her solidarity with [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests|Hong Kong protesters]], remarking that Taiwan's democracy was hard-earned and had to be guarded and renewed. Pledging that as long as she was Taiwan's president, she would never accept "one country, two systems", Tsai cited what she considered to be the constant and rapid deterioration of [[Democratic development in Hong Kong|Hong Kong's democracy]] over the course of 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201906100017.aspx|title=Tsai, Lai voice support for Hong Kong extradition bill protesters|date=10 June 2019|website=Focus Taiwan|publisher=The Central News Agency}}</ref>

===Domestic policy===
Tsai has traditionally been supportive of disadvantaged groups in society, including the poor, women and children, Taiwanese aborigines, and LGBT groups. She favours government action to reduce unemployment, introducing incentives for entrepreneurship among youth, expanding [[public housing]], and government-mandated childcare support. She supports government transparency and more prudent and disciplined fiscal management.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Tsai advocated for the non-partisanship of the president of the [[Legislative Yuan]], the increase in the number of "at-large" seats in the legislature, the broadening of participation among all political parties and interest groups. She supports proactively repairing the damage done to [[Taiwanese aboriginal]] groups, as well as the government actions in the [[February 28 Incident]] and during the phase of [[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]]. She has also called for the de-polarization of Taiwanese politics, and advocates for a more open and consensus-based approach to addressing issues and passing legislation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iing.tw/posts/51 |script-title=zh:五大政治改革 – 點亮台灣 LIGHT UP TAIWAN |website=點亮台灣 LIGHT UP TAIWAN |access-date=22 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131193805/http://iing.tw/posts/51 |archive-date=31 January 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

== Presidency ==
{{main|Presidency of Tsai Ing-wen}}
In the inauguration speech for her first term, Tsai stated policy goals such as pension reform, long-term care for the elderly, transitional justice, and judicial reform.  She outlined an economic policy of diversification via the [[New Southbound Policy]] as well as prioritization of innovative industries.   In terms of cross-strait policy, she acknowledged the [[1992 Consensus]] without agreeing to it and called for continued cross-strait dialogue.<ref name="inaug1">{{cite web|url=https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/201605200008|title=Full text of President Tsai's inaugural address|date=May 20, 2016|access-date=May 20, 2020|work=[[Central News Agency (Republic of China)|Central News Agency]]}}</ref>

In her second inauguration speech, Tsai outlined her major goals in her second term, including instituting a [[lay judge]] system, lowering the [[voting age]] from 20 to 18, and establishing a human rights commission under the [[Control Yuan]].  She also outlined her economic policy, which included transitioning from manufacturing to high-tech industries, with a focus on existing semiconductor and [[information and communications technology]] industries, [[cybersecurity]], [[biotechnology]] and [[healthcare industry|healthcare]], domestic production of military equipment, green energy and strategically-critical industries.  She proposed goals for defense reform, including a focus on [[asymmetric warfare]], maintenance of a [[military reserve force]], and reform in management to reflect a democratic society.  On cross-strait issues, she explicitly rejected the [[one country, two systems]] model proposed by Beijing and expressed a desire for both sides to coexist peacefully.<ref name="inaug2">{{cite web|url=https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202005200003|title=Full text of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen's second-term inaugural address|date=May 20, 2020|access-date=May 20, 2020|work=[[Central News Agency (Republic of China)|Central News Agency]]}}</ref>

During her first inauguration speech, Tsai acknowledged that the talks surrounding the [[1992 Consensus]] took place without agreeing that a consensus was reached.

The Tsai administration proposed a [[lay judge]] system modelled after Japan's over a [[jury system]] proposed by the [[New Power Party]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/04/28/2003735430|title=Reformists criticize Judicial Yuan’s draft|work=[[Taipei Times]]|date=April 28, 2020|first=Shelley|last=Shan|access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref>  The [[Lay judges in Taiwan|Citizen Judges Act]] was passed on July 22, 2020, instituting a lay judge system with three professional judges along six lay judges.

On the flexible rest day, workers may work for overtime pay, and the compulsory rest day guaranteed that workers could not work more than six days in a row.  The amendments also reduced the number of national holidays from 19 to 12, eliminating Youth Day, Teachers’ Day, Retrocession Day, Chiang Kai-shek's birthday, Sun Yat-sen's birthday, Constitution Day and the day following New Year's Day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2018/12/05/2003705533|title='No need' to reinstate holidays: Cabinet|first=Ann|last=Maxon|work=Taipei Times|date=5 December 2018|access-date=15 October 2019}}</ref>  Prior to the amendments, the Labor Standards Act stipulated a maximum of 84 hours of work in any given 14 day period.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201609130023.aspx|title=Labor Ministry passes regulation to enforce one rest day per week|work=Central News Agency|date=13 September 2016|last1=Yu|first1=Hsiao-han|last2=Hou|first2=Elaine|access-date=15 October 2019}}</ref>  The amendments were met with protests from labor groups, who opposed the reduction of national holidays and demanded that work on flexible rest days should result in compensatory vacation days in addition to overtime pay.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201606300017.aspx|title=Cabinet approves draft bill on new work week; labour unions protest|work=Central News Agency|date=30 June 2016|last1=Tai|first1=Ya-chen|last2=Hsu|first2=Elizabeth|access-date=15 October 2019}}</ref>

=== National languages ===
{{further|Languages of Taiwan}}

The Tsai administration took actions to preserve languages facing a crisis of inheritance and to put them on more equal footing to [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]].  Previously, the only national language was Mandarin; during her administration, the [[Languages of Taiwan|national languages of Taiwan]] were eventually broadened to include [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Taiwanese Hokkien]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], 16 [[Formosan languages|indigenous Formosan languages]], [[Taiwanese Sign Language]] and the [[Matsu dialect]] of [[Eastern Min]] spoken on the [[Matsu Islands]].

The Indigenous Languages Development Act took effect on 14 June 2017, designating 16 indigenous Formosan languages as national languages.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2&post=116946|title=Indigenous languages development act takes effect|date=15 June 2017|work=Taiwan Today|access-date=10 October 2019}}</ref>  Hakka was made a national language via amendments to the Hakka Basic Act on 29 December 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2017/12/30/2003684894|title=Hakka made an official language|date=30 December 2017|work=Taipei Times|access-date=10 October 2019}}</ref>  On 25 December 2018, the sweeping National Languages Development Act passed the legislature, creating broadcast services for each national language of Taiwan, guaranteeing access to public services in each language, and introducing elective language classes in primary schools.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&post=147829|title=National languages development act passed by Legislature|work=Taiwan Today|date=26 December 2018|access-date=10 October 2019}}</ref>  The act also directed the government to work with civic groups to create standard orthographies for each national language, and to develop a plan for preserving and revitalizing threatened languages.

On 1 July 2018, the pension reforms came into effect.  Civil servants, upon retirement, have a choice between receiving pensions in monthly instalments subject to a preferential interest rate or via a lump sum.  Under the reforms, the previous preferential interest rate for those who opted for monthly instalments would be gradually reduced from 18% to 0% over the span of 30 months.  Civil servants who opted for a lump sum would see their interest rates decreased from 18% to 6% over a period of 6 years.  The reforms were estimated to affect 63,000 military veterans, 130,000 public servants and 140,000 schoolteachers.  The reforms simultaneously set minimum monthly pensions for schoolteachers and civil servants at $32,160 NTD and for military veterans at $38,990 NTD.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201806300017.aspx|title=New pension systems come into force Sunday|last1=Hsieh|first1=Chia-chen|last2=Yu|first2=Matt|last3=Lin|first3=Ko|work=Central News Agency|date=30 June 2018|access-date=9 October 2019}}</ref>  The reforms also raised the minimum retirement age to 60 from 55, to increase by 1 per year until the retirement age reaches 65.<ref name="pension-reuters" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://theasiadialogue.com/2017/07/28/pension-reform-made-in-taiwan/|title=Pension Reform Made in Taiwan|work=Asia Dialogue|publisher=University of Nottingham, Asia Research Institute|last=Schubert|first=Gunter|date=28 July 2017}}</ref>  Though the reforms were met with protests from government retirees and veterans,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-pension-protests/thousands-protest-outside-taiwan-presidential-office-over-pension-reform-plan-idUSKBN1560EM|title=Thousands protest outside Taiwan Presidential Office over pension reform plan|last=Hung|first=Faith|work=Reuters|date=22 January 2017|access-date=9 October 2019}}</ref> polls have shown that the majority of Taiwanese are satisfied with the outcome of the pension reforms.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201807020029.aspx|title=Most Taiwanese satisfied with pension reform outcome: poll|work=Central News Agency|last1=Lu|first1=Hsin-hui|last2=Kao|first2=Evelyn|date=2 July 2018|access-date=9 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/01/24/2003663694|title=Wide support for pension reform: poll|date=24 January 2017|last=Chen|first=Wei-han|work=Taipei Times|access-date=9 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2017/07/20/2003674924|title=Poll finds pension reform pushed up president's ratings|last=Chen|first=Wei-han|work=Taipei Times|date=20 July 2017|access-date=9 October 2019}}</ref>  After a legal challenge by the [[Kuomintang|KMT]], the [[Judicial Yuan|Constitutional Court]] found most of the pension reform constitutional, while striking down clauses regarding the suspension of pensions for retirees that took jobs later in the private sector.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aipl/201908230024.aspx|work=Central News Agency|title=Parts of pension reform laws violate Constitution: court|date=23 August 2018|access-date=9 October 2019|last1=Lin|first1=Chang-chun|last2=Hsu|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Chen|first3=Christie}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2019/08/24/2003721023|title=Most pension reforms constitutional|work=Taipei Times|date=24 August 2019|last1=Pan|first1=Jason|last2=Lin|first2=Sean|access-date=9 October 2019}}</ref>

The act sought to rectify injustices committed by the authoritarian Kuomintang government of the Republic of China on [[Taiwan]], and to this end established the Transitional Justice Commission to investigate actions taken from 15 August 1945, the date of the [[Jewel Voice Broadcast]], to 6 November 1992, when president [[Lee Teng-hui]] lifted the [[Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion]] for [[Fujian Province, Republic of China]], ending the [[Period of mobilization for the suppression of Communist rebellion|period of mobilization]].<ref name="taitimeslawpassed">{{cite news |last1=Lin |first1=Sean |title=Lawmakers pass transitional justice act |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/12/06/2003683504 |accessdate=1 June 2018 |work=Taipei Times |date=6 December 2017}}</ref><ref name="taidaylawpassed">{{cite news |title=Legislature passes bill promoting transitional justice |url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=2,6,10,15,18&post=126176 |accessdate=1 June 2018 |work=Taiwan Today |date=7 December 2017}}</ref>  This time period, in particular, includes the [[February 28 Incident]] as well as [[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]].
