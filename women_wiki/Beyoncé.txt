'''Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter''' ({{IPAc-en|b|iː|ˈ|j|ɒ|n|s|eɪ}} {{respell|bee|YON|say}}; [[née]] '''Knowles'''; born September 4, 1981)<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2009/12/23/beyonce_knowles_name_change/|title=Beyoncé Knowles' name change|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=December 23, 2009|access-date=March 8, 2013}}</ref> is an American singer, actress and record producer. Born and raised in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], Beyoncé performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of [[Destiny's Child]], one of the [[List of best-selling girl groups|best-selling girl groups of all time]]. Beyoncé is often cited as an influence by [[List of artists influenced by Beyoncé|other artists]].

During Destiny's Child's hiatus, Beyoncé made her theatrical film debut with a role in the US box-office number-one ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'' (2002) and began her solo music career. She became the first music act to debut at number one with their first six solo studio albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7350372/beyonce-earns-sixth-no-1-album-on-billboard-200-chart-with-lemonade|title=Beyonce Earns Sixth No. 1 Album on Billboard 200 Chart With 'Lemonade'|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|work=Billboard|access-date=May 31, 2018}}</ref> Her debut album ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'' (2003) featured four [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top five songs, including the number-one singles "[[Crazy in Love]]" featuring rapper [[Jay-Z]] and "[[Baby Boy (Beyoncé song)|Baby Boy]]" featuring singer-rapper [[Sean Paul]]. Following the disbandment of Destiny's Child in 2006, she released her second solo album, ''[[B'Day (Beyoncé album)|B'Day]]'', which contained her first US number-one solo single "[[Irreplaceable]]", and "[[Beautiful Liar]]", which topped the charts in most countries. Beyoncé continued her acting career with starring roles in ''[[The Pink Panther (2006 film)|The Pink Panther]]'' (2006), ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'' (2006), and ''[[Obsessed (2009 film)|Obsessed]]'' (2009). Her marriage to Jay-Z and her portrayal of [[Etta James]] in ''[[Cadillac Records]]'' (2008) influenced her third album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' (2008), which earned a record-setting [[Grammy Award records#Most Grammys won by a female artist in one night|six Grammy Awards]] in 2010. It spawned the UK number-one single "[[If I Were a Boy]]", the US number-one single "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" and the top five single "[[Halo (Beyoncé song)|Halo]]".

After splitting from her manager and father [[Mathew Knowles]] in 2010, Beyoncé released the album ''[[4 (Beyoncé album)|4]]'' (2011); it was influenced by 1970s [[funk]], 1980s pop, and 1990s [[Soul music|soul]]. She achieved back-to-back widespread critical acclaim for her sonically experimental visual albums, ''[[Beyoncé (album)|Beyoncé]]'' (2013) and ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]'' (2016); the latter was the world's best-selling album of 2016 and the most acclaimed album of her career, exploring themes of [[infidelity]] and [[womanism]]. In 2018, she released ''[[Everything Is Love]]'', a collaborative album with her husband, Jay-Z, as [[the Carters]]. As a featured artist, Beyoncé topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 with the remixes of "[[Perfect (Ed Sheeran song)#Perfect Duet|Perfect]]" by [[Ed Sheeran]] in 2017 and "[[Savage (song)#Beyoncé remix|Savage]]" by [[Megan Thee Stallion]] in 2020. The same year, she made her directorial and screenwriting debut with the [[musical film]] and [[visual album]] ''[[Black Is King]]'', which received widespread critical acclaim after premiering on [[Disney+]].

Beyoncé has long received criticism, including from journalists and musicians, for the extensive writing credits on her songs.<ref name="Fallon"/> The controversy surrounding her songwriting credits began with interviews in which she attributed herself as the songwriter for songs in which she was a co-writer<ref name="Kritselis"/> or for which her contributions were marginal.<ref name="Fallon"/> In a cover story for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 2005, she claimed to have "written" several number-one songs for Destiny's Child, contrary to the credits, which list her as a co-writer among others.<ref name="Kritselis">{{cite news|last=Kritselis|first=Alex|date=May 4, 2014|url=https://www.pressreader.com/south-africa/the-sunday-independent/20140504/282235188670231|title=Beyonce is great, but... she steals from other artists|newspaper=[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]|access-date=August 24, 2020|via=PressReader.com}}</ref> In a 2007 interview with [[Barbara Walters]], she claimed to have conceived the musical idea for the Destiny's Child hit "Bootylicious",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theboombox.com/beyonce-bootylicious/|title=Beyonce Accused of Stealing Credit for 'Bootylicious'|website=[[The Boombox]]|access-date=August 27, 2020}}</ref> which provoked the song's producer [[Rob Fusari]] to call her father and then-manager Mathew Knowles in protest over the claim. As Fusari tells ''Billboard'', "[Knowles] explained to me, in a nice way, he said, 'People don't want to hear about Rob Fusari, producer from Livingston, N.J. No offense, but that's not what sells records.

In 2007, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] ruled out Beyoncé as a songwriter on "Listen" (from ''Dreamgirls'') for its Oscar nomination in the Best Original Song category. Responding to a then-new three-writer limit, the Academy deemed her contribution the least significant for inclusion.<ref name="Fallon"/> In 2009, Ryan Tedder's original demo for "Halo" leaked on the Internet, revealing an identical resemblance to Beyoncé's recording, for which she received a writing credit. When interviewed by ''The Guardian'', Tedder explained that Beyoncé had edited the bridge of the song vocally and thus earned the credit, although he vaguely questioned the ethics of her possible "demand" for a writing credit in other instances.<ref name="Kritselis"/> Tedder elaborated when speaking to Gigwise that “She does stuff on any given song that, when you go from the demo to the final version, takes it to another level that you never would have thought of as the writer. For instance, on ‘Halo,’ that bridge on her version is completely different to my original one. Basically, she came in, ditched that, edited it, did her vocal thing on it, and now it’s become one of my favorite parts of the song. The whole melody, she wrote it spontaneously in the studio. So her credit on that song stems from that.” <ref name="WMag">{{cite web|date=June 19, 2018|url=https://wmagazine.com/story/beyonce-writes-her-own-songs/|title=Beyoncé Is “100 Percent Involved” in Writing Her Own Songs Say Everything Is Love Producers Cool & Dre|website=[[W Magazine]]|accessdate=August 27, 2020}}</ref> In 2014, the popular industry songwriter [[Linda Perry]] responded to a question about Beyoncé receiving a co-writing credit for changing one lyric to a song: "Well haha um that's not songwriting but some of these artists believe if it wasn't for them your song would never get out there so they take a cut just because they are who they are.

Beyoncé's success has led to her becoming a cultural icon and earning her the nickname "Queen Bey".<ref>{{cite web|title= Beyoncé's star formation: from Destiny's Child to Queen Bey|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/27/beyonce-star-formation-destinys-child-queen-bey-tour|newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 27, 2016}}</ref> In ''[[The New Yorker]]'', music critic [[Jody Rosen]] described Beyoncé as "the most important and compelling popular musician of the twenty-first century ... the result, the logical end point, of a century-plus of pop."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/02/her-highness.html|title=Her Highness|website=The New Yorker|date=February 20, 2013|access-date=February 20, 2013}}</ref> Author James Clear, in his book ''Atomic Habits'' (2018), draws a parallel between the singer's success and the dramatic transformations in modern society: "In the last one hundred years, we have seen the rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, and Beyoncé."<ref>https://books.google.com.br/books?id=fFCjDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT121</ref> When ''[[The Observer]]'' named her Artist of the Decade in 2009, Llewyn-Smith wrote:

{{quote|"Why Beyoncé? ... Because she made not one but two of the decade's greatest singles, with 'Crazy in Love' and 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)', not to mention her hits with Destiny's Child; and this was the decade when singles – particularly R&B singles – regained their status as pop's favourite medium. ... [She] and not any superannuated rock star was arguably the greatest live performer of the past 10 years."<ref name="smith" />|author=|title=|source=}}

Writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Alex Suskind noticed how Beyoncé was the decade's (2010s) defining pop star, stating that "no one dominated music in the 2010s like Queen Bey", explaining that her "songs, album rollouts, stage presence, social justice initiatives, and disruptive public relations strategy have influenced the way we've viewed music since 2010."<ref name="EW">{{cite news|last=Suskind|first=Alex|title=Best of the Decade: How Beyoncé defined the last 10 years of music|url=https://ew.com/music/2019/11/20/best-of-the-decade-how-beyonce-defined-the-last-10-years-of-music/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=November 22, 2019|date=November 20, 2019}}</ref> British publication ''[[NME]]'' also shared similar thoughts on her impact in the 2010s, including Beyoncé on their list of the "10 Artists Who Defined The Decade", explaining: "So much more than a popstar, Beyonce has become an outspoken advocate for civil rights, feminism and self-expression, proving that it's possible to be politically engaged and still hold down an extremely successful career in mainstream entertainment."<ref name="NME2">{{cite news|last=Cooper|first=Leonie|title=10 Artists Who Defined The Decade: The 2010s|url=https://www.nme.com/features/nmes-10-artists-who-defined-the-decade-the-2010s-2583451|work=[[NME]]|access-date=December 24, 2019|date=December 3, 2019}}</ref>

In 2013, Beyoncé made the ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' 100 list, with [[Baz Luhrmann]] writing:

{{quote|"No one has that voice, no one moves the way she moves, no one can hold an audience the way she does ... When Beyoncé does an album, when Beyoncé sings a song, when Beyoncé does anything, it's an event, and it's broadly influential.

It's one reason Beyoncé may be the most universally beloved artist of the Gen Y. A figure of talent, beauty and grace, Queen Bey has developed into the most exciting artist of the millennium as well as a political figure, setting the tone for how other major stars speak about feminism and the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement with the release of her landmark ''Lemonade'' album in 2016."<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/the-millennial-100-737215/beyonce-rules-the-world-737225/ |date=October 17, 2018 |work=Rolling Stone |author=Spanos, Brittany |access-date=October 8, 2019| title=The Millennial 100}}</ref>

She is often credited for the cultural shift towards female pop singers rapping and for creating the staccato style of 'rap-singing' she used in songs like "[[Bug a Boo]]" and "[[Say My Name]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/female-pop-singers-rap/|title=Why Are Female Pop Singers Turning To Rap?|website=Highsnobiety|date=March 27, 2018|access-date=June 22, 2019}}</ref> ''[[Uproxx]]'' stated that Beyoncé is the primary pioneer of the singsong style that dominates Hip-Hop currently,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/music/what-genre-is-beyonce/|title=What Genre Is Beyonce, Anyway?|website=Uproxx|date=July 27, 2020|access-date=July 28, 2020}}</ref> while Sheldon Pearce of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' noticed her contribution in changing the sound of pop music radio with her hip-hop assisted style, writing:

{{quote|"Her hip-hop fluency gave her an advantage in the pop-star arms race, helping her to become the presiding voice in an increasingly rap-dominated musical landscape.

Beyoncé's releases of ''[[Beyoncé (album)|Beyoncé]]'' in 2013 and ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]'' in 2016, which are both [[concept album]]s and visual albums, have been credited with revolutionizing the music industry, reinventing the album and transforming how people consume music.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Robinson|first=Peter|date=January 1, 2014|title=Beyoncé has reinvented how to release an album.
