Yellen graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from [[Pembroke College in Brown University]] with a degree in economics in 1967.

In August 1994, Yellen took leave from Berkeley for five years. [[Bill Clinton]] appointed her as a member of the [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]], where she served from August 12, 1994 to February 17, 1997.

Within this study, the Council analyzed data from 1969 to 1996 to determine the cause for women to earn substantially less than men. By observing trends attributable to issues like occupation/industry as well as familial status, it was determined that while the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]] was a step forward, there was no explanation as to why there was a 75 percent difference between average pay for women and men. It was concluded that this gap had no correlation with differences in productivity and, as such, was the repercussions of discrimination within the workforce.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/WH/EOP/CEA/html/gendergap.html|title=EXPLAINING TRENDS IN THE GENDER WAGE GAP|website=clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov|access-date=2019-11-12|archive-date=November 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112163200/https://clintonwhitehouse2.archives.gov/WH/EOP/CEA/html/gendergap.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Yellen served as president of the [[Western Economic Association International]] and is a former vice president of the [[American Economic Association]].

In a 2005 speech in San Francisco, Yellen argued against deflating the housing bubble because "arguments against trying to deflate a bubble outweigh those in favor of it" and predicted that the housing bubble "could be large enough to feel like a good-sized bump in the road, but the economy would likely be able to absorb the shock."<ref>{{cite web

Bullard's statement was interpreted as a possible shift within the FOMC balance between inflation hawks and doves. Yellen's pending confirmation, along with those of [[Peter A.
