==Award shows==

DeGeneres received wider exposure on November 4, 2001, when she hosted the televised broadcast of the [[Emmy Award]]s. Presented after two cancellations due to network concerns that a lavish ceremony following the [[September 11 attacks]] would appear insensitive, the show required a more somber tone that would also allow viewers to temporarily forget the tragedy. DeGeneres received several standing [[ovation]]s for her performance that evening, which included the line: "What would bug the [[Taliban]] more than seeing a gay woman in a suit surrounded by [[Jews]]?"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-ellen-degeneres-hosting-history-598767|title=Oscars: Ellen DeGeneres' Hosting History|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=July 15, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715235830/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-ellen-degeneres-hosting-history-598767|archive-date=July 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Humanitarianism===
In November 2011, Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] named DeGeneres a [[special envoy]] for Global [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] Awareness.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/09/us-ellendegeneres-idUSTRE7A85O520111109 |agency=Reuters |title=Ellen DeGeneres named global envoy for AIDS awareness |date=November 9, 2011 |first=Chris |last=Michaud |access-date=July 1, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005130302/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/09/us-ellendegeneres-idUSTRE7A85O520111109 |archive-date=October 5, 2015 |url-status=live  }}</ref> On December 3, 2011, DeGeneres opened the show at the [[David Lynch Foundation]]'s 3rd annual "Change Begins Within" gala at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] to raise funds to bring [[Transcendental Meditation]] to at-risk populations suffering from epidemic levels of chronic [[stress (psychological)|stress]] and [[PTSD|stress-related disorders]]. She says: "TM is the only time I have that stillness… it gives me this peaceful feeling, and I love it so much. I can't say enough good things about it.

In November 2017, it was announced that President [[Donald Trump]] would begin allowing the importation of elephant trophies from Africa.
