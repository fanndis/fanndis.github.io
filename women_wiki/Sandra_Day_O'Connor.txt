'''Sandra Day O'Connor''' (born March 26, 1930) is a retired attorney, politician, and the first woman [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]], a position she held from 1981 until her retirement in 2006. She was the first woman nominated and confirmed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Weisman |first=Steven R. |date=July 7, 1981 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0707.html |title=Reagan Nominating Woman, an Arizona Appeals Judge, to Serve on Supreme Court |work=The New York Times |access-date=September 10, 2009 }}</ref> Nominated by President [[Ronald Reagan]], she was considered the [[swing vote]] for the [[Rehnquist Court]] and the beginning of the [[Roberts Court]].

Prior to O'Connor's tenure on the Court, she was a judge and an elected official in [[Arizona]], serving as the first female majority leader of a state senate as the Republican leader in the [[Arizona Senate]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=O'Connor, Sandra Day |publisher=[[Federal Judicial Center]] |url=http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=1796 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040306042155/http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=1796 |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 6, 2004 |access-date=March 21, 2006 }}</ref> Upon her nomination to the Court, O'Connor was confirmed unanimously by the Senate.

As a [[Rockefeller Republican|moderate Republican]], O'Connor tended to approach each case narrowly without seeking to establish sweeping precedents. She most frequently sided with the Court's conservative bloc. She often wrote concurring opinions that limited the reach of the majority holding. Her majority opinions in landmark cases include ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'' and ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]''. She also wrote in part the ''[[per curiam]]'' majority opinion in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', and was one of three co-authors of the lead opinion in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]''.

During her time on the court, some publications ranked O'Connor among the most powerful women in the world.<ref>{{Cite news|first=John |last=McCaslin |title=Power Women |url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/JohnMcCaslin/2001/11/07/mccaslins_beltway_beat |work=McCaslin's Beltway Beat |publisher=[[Townhall.com]] |location=Washington, D.C. |date=November 7, 2001 |access-date=June 15, 2009 |quote= ...

=== Tenure ===
O'Connor has said she felt a responsibility to demonstrate women could do the job of justice.<ref name="freshair" /> She faced some practical concerns, including the lack of a woman's restroom near the Courtroom.<ref name="freshair" />

Two years after O'Connor joined the Court, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an editorial which mentioned the "nine men"<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/29/opinion/topics-in-the-name-of-the-law-legal-abc-s.html|title=Topics: In the Name of the LawOPICS: Legal ABC's|date=September 29, 1983|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 22, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> of the "SCOTUS", or Supreme Court of the United States.<ref name=":2" /> O'Connor responded with a letter to the editor reminding the ''Times'' that the Court was no longer composed of nine men and referred to herself as FWOTSC (First Woman On The Supreme Court).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/12/opinion/l-high-court-s-9-men-were-a-surprise-to-one-225413.html|title=High Court's '9 Men' Were a Surprise to One|date=October 12, 1983|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 19, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

O'Connor was a proponent of collegiality among justices on the court, often insisting that the justices eat lunch together.<ref name=":18" />

In 1993, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] became the second female Supreme Court justice.<ref name=":18">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/03/15/693542112/from-triumph-to-tragedy-first-tells-story-of-justice-sandra-day-oconnor|title=From Triumph To Tragedy, 'First' Tells Story Of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor|last=Totenberg|first=Nina|date=March 15, 2019|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref> O'Connor said she felt relief from the media clamor when she was no longer the only woman on the court.<ref name=":18" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?57167-1/women-bench|title=Women on the Bench {{!}} C-SPAN.org|website=www.c-span.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref> In May 2010, O'Connor warned female Supreme Court nominee [[Elena Kagan]] about the "unpleasant" process of confirmation hearings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/sandra-day-oconnor-cautions-elena-kagan-dreadful-nomination/story?id=10754455|title=Retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor Backs Elena Kagan Nomination|last=Clarke|first=Suzan|date=May 27, 2010|publisher=[[ABC News]]|access-date=December 19, 2010}}</ref>

===Supreme Court jurisprudence===

[[File:O'ConnorGonzalesCloseUp.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Justice O'Connor presents [[Alberto Gonzales]] to the audience after swearing him in as [[U.S. Attorney General]], as Becky Gonzales looks on.]]
Initially, O'Connor's voting record aligned closely with the conservative [[William Rehnquist]] (voting with him 87% of the time her first three years at the Court).<ref>{{harvp|Greenburg|2007|p=68}}</ref> From that time until 1998, O'Connor's alignment with Rehnquist ranged from 93.4% to 63.2%, hitting above 90% in three of those years.<ref name="la times">{{cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Herman |date=April 12, 1998 |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/12/opinion/op-38686 |title=O'Connor as a 'Centrist'? Not When Minorities Are Involved |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}</ref> In nine of her first sixteen years on the Court, O'Connor voted with Rehnquist more than with any other justice.<ref name="la times"/>

Later on, as the Court's make-up became more conservative (e.g., [[Anthony Kennedy]] replacing [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.|Lewis Powell]], and [[Clarence Thomas]] replacing [[Thurgood Marshall]]), O'Connor often became the [[swing vote]] on the Court. However, she usually disappointed the Court's more liberal bloc in contentious 5–4 decisions: from 1994 to 2004, she joined the traditional conservative bloc of Rehnquist, [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Anthony Kennedy]], and Thomas 82 times; she joined the liberal bloc of [[John Paul Stevens]], [[David Souter]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and [[Stephen Breyer]] only 28 times.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/118/Nov04/Nine_Justices_Ten_YearsFTX.pdf |title=Nine Justices, Ten Years: A Statistical Retrospective |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume= 118 |number=1 |page=521 |date=November 2004 |access-date=August 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327053526/http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/118/Nov04/Nine_Justices_Ten_YearsFTX.pdf |archive-date=March 27, 2006}}</ref>

Some notable cases in which O'Connor joined the majority in a 5–4 decision were:
* ''[[McConnell v. FEC]]'', {{ussc|540|93|2003}}, upholding the constitutionality of most of the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|McCain-Feingold campaign-finance bill]] regulating "[[Campaign finance in the United States#Hard money and soft money|soft money]]" contributions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/cases-which-sandra-day-oconnor-cast-decisive-vote|title=Cases in Which Sandra Day O'Connor Cast the Decisive Vote|website=American Civil Liberties Union|language=en|access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>
* ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', {{ussc|539|306|2003}} and ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'', {{ussc|539|244|2003}}, O'Connor wrote the opinion of the Court in ''Grutter'' and joined the majority in ''Gratz''. In this pair of cases, the [[University of Michigan]]'s undergraduate admissions program was held to have engaged in unconstitutional [[reverse discrimination]], but the more-limited type of [[affirmative action]] in the [[University of Michigan Law School]]'s admissions program was held to have been constitutional.
* ''[[Lockyer v. Andrade]]'', {{ussc|538|63|2003}}: O'Connor wrote the majority opinion, with the four conservative justices concurring, that a 50-year to life sentence without parole for petty shoplifting a few children's videotapes under California's three strikes law was not cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment because there was no "clearly established" law to that effect. Leandro Andrade, a Latino nine year Army veteran and father of three, will be eligible for parole in 2046 at age eighty-seven.
* ''[[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]]'', {{ussc|536|639|2002}}, O'Connor joined the majority holding that the use of school vouchers for religious schools did not violate the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.
*''[[United States v. Lopez]]'', {{ussc|514|549|1995}}: O'Connor joined a majority holding unconstitutional the [[Gun-Free School Zones Act]] as beyond Congress's [[Commerce Clause]] power.
* ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', {{ussc|531|98|2000}}, O'Connor joined with four other justices on December 12, 2000, to rule on the ''Bush v. Gore'' case that ceased challenges to the results of the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] (ruling to stop the ongoing [[Florida election recount]] and to allow no further recounts). This case effectively ended Gore's hopes to become president. Some legal scholars have argued that she should have recused herself from this case, citing several reports that she became upset when the media initially announced that Gore had won Florida, with her husband explaining that they would have to wait another four years before retiring to Arizona.<ref name="Neumann">{{Cite journal |first=Richard K., Jr. |last=Neumann |title=Conflicts of interest in Bush v.

O'Connor played an important role in other notable cases, such as:
* ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'', {{ussc|492|490|1989}}: This decision upheld as constitutional state restrictions on second trimester abortions that are not necessary to protect maternal health, contrary to the original trimester requirements in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. Although O'Connor joined the majority, which also included Rehnquist, Scalia, Kennedy and [[Byron White]], in a concurring opinion she refused to explicitly overturn ''Roe''.

On February 22, 2005, with Rehnquist and Stevens (who were senior to her) absent, she became the senior justice presiding over oral arguments in the case of ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]'' and becoming the first woman to do so before the Court.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Glass |first1=Andrew |title=Senate confirms first female Supreme Court justice, Sept. 21, 1981 |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/senate-confirms-first-female-supreme-court-justice-sept-21-1981-228285 |website=politico.com |publisher=Politico, LLC. |access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref>

====First Amendment====
Justice O'Connor was unpredictable in many of her court decisions, especially those regarding First Amendment [[Establishment Clause|Establishment Cause]] issues. Avoiding ideology, she decided on a case-by-case basis and voted with careful deliberation in a way that she felt benefited individual rights and the Constitution (which she viewed to be "an ever changing work in progress.") Barry Lynn, executive director of [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], said, "O'Connor was a conservative, but she saw the complexity of church-state issues and tried to choose a course that respected the country's religious diversity" (Hudson 2005). O'Connor voted in favor of religious institutions,{{Clarify|reason=|date=May 2017}} such as in ''[[Zelman v. Simmons-Harris]]'', ''[[Mitchell v. Helms]]'', and ''[[Rosenberger v. University of Virginia]]''. Conversely, in ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'' she was part of the majority in the case that saw religious prayer and pressure to stand in silence at a graduation ceremony as part of a religious act that coerced people to support or to participate in religion, which is strictly prohibited by the Establishment Clause. This is consistent with a similar case, ''[[Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe]]'', involving prayer at a school football game. In this case, O'Connor joined the majority opinion that stated prayer at school football games violates the Establishment Clause. O'Connor was the first justice to articulate the "no endorsement" standard for the Establishment Clause.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2013/10/religious-liberty-and-supreme-court|title=Endorsing the endorsement test|last=S.M.|date=October 8, 2013|journal=The Economist|access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref> In ''[[Lynch v. Donnelly]]'', O'Connor signed onto a five-justice majority opinion holding that a nativity scene in a public Christmas display did not violate the First Amendment. She penned a concurrence in that case, opining that the crèche was not violative of the Establishment Clause because it did not express an endorsement or disapproval of any religion.<ref name=":4" />

==== Fourth Amendment ====
According to law professor [[Jeffrey Rosen (legal academic)|Jeffrey Rosen]], "O'Connor was an eloquent opponent of intrusive group searches that threatened privacy without increasing security. In a [[United States v. Place|1983 opinion]] upholding searches by drug-sniffing dogs, she recognized that a search is most likely to be considered [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutionally reasonable]] if it is very effective at discovering [[contraband]] without revealing ''innocent but embarrassing'' information."<ref>{{cite news |author-link=Jeffrey Rosen (legal academic) |last=Rosen |first=Jeffrey |date=November 28, 2010 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/26/AR2010112604290.html |title=The TSA is invasive, annoying&nbsp;– and unconstitutional |work=The Washington Post }}</ref> [[Washington College of Law]] law professor Andrew Taslitz, referencing O'Connor's [[Atwater v.

====Cases involving race====
In the 1990 and 1995 ''[[Missouri v. Jenkins]]'' rulings, O'Connor voted with the majority that district courts had no authority to require the state of Missouri to increase school funding in order to counteract racial inequality. In the 1991 ''Freeman v. Pitts'' case, O'Connor joined a concurring opinion in a plurality, agreeing that a school district that had formerly been under judicial review for racial segregation could be freed of this review, even though not all desegregation targets had been met. Law professor Herman Schwartz criticized these rulings, writing that in both cases "both the fact and effects of segregation were still present."<ref name="la times" />

In ''[[McCleskey v. Kemp]]'' in 1987, O'Connor joined a 5–4 majority that voted to uphold the death penalty for an African American man, Warren McCleskey, convicted of killing a white police officer, despite statistical evidence that black defendants were more likely to receive the death penalty than others both in Georgia and in the U.S. as a whole.<ref name="la times" /><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=/GovernmentPolitics/Government/LegalCases&id=h-2933 |title=McCleskey v. Kemp |encyclopedia=[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]] }}</ref><ref>David Baldus, et al., "In The Post-Furman Era: An Empirical And Legal Overview, With Recent Findings From Philadelphia", 83 ''Cornell Law Rev.'' 1638 (1998)</ref>

In 1996's ''Shaw v. Hunt'' and ''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'', O'Connor joined a Rehnquist opinion, following an earlier precedent from an opinion she authored in 1993, in which the Court struck down an electoral districting plan designed to facilitate the election of two black representatives out of twelve from North Carolina, a state that had not had any black representative since Reconstruction, despite being approximately 20% black<ref name="la times" />—the Court held that the districts were unacceptably [[gerrymander]]ed and O'Connor called the odd shape of the district in question, North Carolina's 12th, "bizarre".

Law Professor Herman Schwartz called O'Connor "the Court's leader in its assault on racially oriented [[affirmative action]],"<ref name="la times"/> although she joined with the Court in upholding the constitutionality of race-based admissions to universities.<ref name="presidential leadership"/>

In 2003, she authored a majority Supreme Court opinion (''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'') saying racial affirmative action shouldn't be constitutional permanently, but long enough to correct past discrimination—with an approximate limit of around 25 years.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.hlrecord.org/2.4463/justice-o-connor-affirmative-action-should-continue-1.577502 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120118081933/http://www.hlrecord.org/2.4463/justice-o-connor-affirmative-action-should-continue-1.577502 |archive-date=January 18, 2012 |title=Justice O'Connor: affirmative action should continue |access-date=March 9, 2012 }}</ref>

====Abortion====
The [[Christian right]] element in the Reagan coalition strongly supported him in 1980, in the belief that he would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn ''Roe vs Wade''. They were astonished and dismayed when his first appointment was O'Connor, whom they feared would tolerate abortion. They worked hard to defeat her confirmation but failed.<ref>Prudence Flowers, "‘A Prolife Disaster’: The Reagan Administration and the Nomination of Sandra Day O’Connor." ''Journal of Contemporary History''  53.2 (2018): 391-414.</ref> In her confirmation hearings and early days on the Court, O'Connor was carefully ambiguous on the issue of abortion, as some conservatives questioned her pro-life credentials on the basis of some of her votes in the Arizona legislature.<ref name="greenburg 222"/> O'Connor generally dissented from 1980s opinions which took an expansive view of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''; she criticized that decision's "trimester approach" sharply in her dissent in 1983's ''[[City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health]].'' She criticized ''Roe'' in ''[[Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]]'': "... I dispute not only the wisdom but also the legitimacy of the Court's attempt to discredit and pre-empt state abortion regulation regardless of the interests it serves and the impact it has."<ref>Greenhouse, Linda. ''Becoming Justice Blackmun''. [[Times Books]]. 2005. p. 183.</ref> In 1989, O'Connor stated during the deliberations over the ''Webster'' case that she would not overrule ''Roe''.<ref>{{harvp|Greenburg|2007|p=80}}</ref> While on the Court, O'Connor did not vote to strike down any restrictions on abortion until ''[[Hodgson v. Minnesota]]'' in 1990.<ref name="Greenhouse, Becoming Justice Blackmun">{{citation | author = Greenhouse, Linda | author-link = Linda Greenhouse | title = Becoming Justice Blackmun | publisher = Times Books | year = 2005 | pages = 196–197}}</ref>

O'Connor allowed certain limits to be placed on access to abortion, but supported the fundamental right to abortion protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', O'Connor used a test she had originally developed in ''City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health'' to limit the holding of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', opening up a legislative portal where a State could enact measures so long as they did not place an "undue burden" on a woman's right to an abortion. Casey revised downward the standard of scrutiny federal courts would apply to state abortion restrictions, a major departure from Roe. However, it preserved Roe's core constitutional precept: that the Fourteenth Amendment implies and protects a woman's fundamental right to control the outcomes of her reproductive actions. Writing the plurality opinion for the Court, O'Connor, along with justices Kennedy and Souter, famously declared: "At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State."<ref>''Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey,'' 505 U.S. 833, 851 (1992).</ref>

====Foreign law====
O'Connor was a vigorous defender of the citing of foreign laws in judicial decisions.<ref>{{cite journal |issn=0392-6664  |url=https://www.academia.edu/2420553 |title=Il diritto straniero e la Corte suprema statunitense |language=it |journal=Quaderni Costituzionali |date=June 2006|last1=Buonomo |first1=Giampiero }}</ref> On October 28, 2003, O'Connor spoke at the [[Southern Center for International Studies]]:

<blockquote>The impressions we create in this world are important and can leave their mark ... [T]here is talk today about the "internationalization of legal relations". We are already seeing this in American courts, and should see it increasingly in the future. This does not mean, of course, that our courts can or should abandon their character as domestic institutions. But conclusions reached by other countries and by the international community, although not formally binding upon our decisions, should at times constitute persuasive authority in American courts—what is sometimes called "transjudicialism".<ref name=speech>{{cite web |url=http://www.southerncenter.org/OConnor_transcript.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314163104/http://www.southerncenter.org/OConnor_transcript.pdf |archive-date=March 14, 2012 |title=Remarks at the Southern Center for International Studies |first=Sandra Day |last= O'Connor |date=October 28, 2003 }}</ref></blockquote>

In the speech she noted the 2002 Court case ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'', in which the majority decision (which included her) cited disapproval of the death penalty in Europe as part of its argument. This speech, and the general concept of relying on foreign law and opinion,<ref>Kearney Evan, ''The Utilization of Foreign Law in Domestic Constitutional Interpretation''. King's Inns Law Review, Vol. 8, pp. 127–168 (2019).</ref> was widely criticized by conservatives. In May 2004, a committee in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] responded by passing a non-binding resolution, the "Reaffirmation of American Independence Resolution", stating that "U.S. judicial decisions should not be based on any foreign laws, court decisions, or pronouncements of foreign governments unless they are relevant to determining the meaning of American constitutional and statutory law."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061001043259/http://www.house.gov/list/press/fl24_feeney/ResConstitutionSubPassage.shtml "Reaffirmation of American Independence Resolution Approved"], May 13, 2004.</ref>

O'Connor once quoted the [[Constitution of Bahrain|constitution]] of the Middle Eastern nation of [[Bahrain]], which states that "[n]o authority shall prevail over the judgement of a judge, and under no circumstances may the course of justice be interfered with." Further, "[i]t is in everyone's interest to foster the rule-of-law evolution." O'Connor proposed that such ideas be taught in American law schools, high schools and universities. Critics contend that such thinking is contrary to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and establishes a rule of man, rather than law.<ref name=speech/> In her retirement, she has continued to speak and organize conferences on the issue of [[judicial independence]].

====Commentary and analysis====
O'Connor's case-by-case approach routinely placed her in the center of the Court and drew both criticism and praise. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Charles Krauthammer]], for example, described her as lacking a judicial philosophy and instead displaying "political positioning embedded in a social agenda."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Philosophy for a Judge|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/07/AR2005070701898.html |work=The Washington Post | first=Charles|last=Krauthammer|access-date=November 18, 2005 | date=July 8, 2005}}</ref> Conservative commentator, [[Ramesh Ponnuru]], wrote that, even though O'Connor "has voted reasonably well", her tendency to issue very case-specific rulings "undermines the predictability of the law and aggrandizes the judicial role."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Sandra's Day|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/ponnuru200507011211.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050911141328/http://www.nationalreview.com/flashback/ponnuru200507011211.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 11, 2005|access-date=March 18, 2007| first=Ramesh|last=Ponnuru|work=[[National Review]]|date=June 30, 2003}}</ref>

Law clerks serving the court in 2000 speculated that the decision she reached in Bush v Gore was based on a desire to appear fair, rather than on any legal rationale, pointing to a memo she sent out the night before the decision was issued that used entirely different logic to reach the same result. They also characterized her approach to cases as deciding on "gut feelings".<ref name="vanityfair.com"/>

=== Other activities while serving on the Court ===
In 2003, she wrote a book titled ''The Majesty of the Law: Reflections of a Supreme Court Justice'' ({{ISBN|0-375-50925-9}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Majesty of the Law |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-majesty-of-the-law |website=pbs.org |publisher=PBS |access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref> In 2005, she wrote a children's book, ''Chico'', named for her favorite horse, which offered an autobiographical depiction of her childhood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=1076621&page=1|title=Sandra Day O'Connor Writes Children's Book|last=ABC News|date=June 1, 2006|website=ABC News|language=en|access-date=May 11, 2018}}</ref>

==Retirement==
On December 12, 2000, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that O'Connor was reluctant to retire with a Democrat in the presidency: "At an Election Night party at the Washington, D.C., home of Mary Ann Stoessel, widow of former Ambassador [[Walter John Stoessel Jr.|Walter Stoessel]], the justice's husband, John O'Connor, mentioned to others her desire to step down, according to three witnesses. But Mr. O'Connor said his wife would be reluctant to retire if a Democrat were in the White House and would choose her replacement. Justice O'Connor declined to comment."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics: "Conflicts of interest in Bush v.

By 2005, the composition of the Court had been unchanged for eleven years, the second-longest period in American history without any such change. Rehnquist was widely expected to be the first justice to retire during Bush's term, owing to his age and his battle with cancer, although rumors of O'Connor's possible retirement circulated as well.<ref name=":7">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/01/AR2005070100653.html|title=Supreme Court Justice O'Connor Resigns|last1=Deane|first1=Daniela|date=July 1, 2005|work=The Washington Post|access-date=October 27, 2017|last2=Branigin|first2=William|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|last3=Barbash|first3=Fred}}</ref> Before deciding to retire, O'Connor consulted Rehnquist on his plans in an attempt to avoid having two retirements at the same time.<ref name="NewsMax">{{Cite news|url=http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/2/5/92619.shtml|title=Former Justice O'Connor:'I Would Have Stayed Longer'|author=Staff writer|date=February 5, 2007|access-date=August 24, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130130001722/http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/2/5/92619.shtml|archive-date=January 30, 2013|url-status=dead|agency=[[Associated Press|The Associated Press]] via [[NewsMax Media]]}}</ref>

On July 1, 2005, O'Connor announced her intention to retire. In her letter to Bush, she stated that her retirement from active service would take effect upon the confirmation of her successor.<ref name=":7" /> Her letter did not provide a reason for her departure; however, a Supreme Court spokeswoman confirmed O'Connor was leaving to spend time with her husband,<ref name=":7" /> who was suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name="NewsMax" /> At her retirement she was still in good health, an exception to the usual practice of justices serving until death or nearly incapacitated.<ref name="NewsMax" />

On July 19, Bush nominated [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit]] Judge [[John Roberts]] to succeed O'Connor.

==Post-Supreme Court career==
[[File:O'Connor and Kagan.jpg|thumb|right|O'Connor in 2008 with [[Harvard Law School]] Dean [[Elena Kagan]]. Kagan became the fourth female justice on the Court.]]

During a March 2006 speech at [[Georgetown University]], O'Connor said some political attacks on the independence of the Courts pose a direct threat to the constitutional freedoms of Americans. She said "any reform of the system is debatable as long as it is not motivated by “nakedly partisan reasoning” retaliation because congressmen or senators dislike the result of the cases. Courts interpret the law as it was written, not as the congressmen might have wished it was written", and "it takes a lot of degeneration before a country falls into dictatorship, but we should avoid these ends by avoiding these beginnings."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5255712|title=O'Connor Decries Republican Attacks on Courts|website=NPR.org}}</ref> She echoed her concerns for an independent judiciary during the dedication address at the [[Elon University School of Law]] in September of that same year.

On November 19, 2008, O'Connor published an introductory essay to a themed issue on judicial accountability in the ''Denver University Law Review''. She calls for a better public understanding of judicial accountability.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/denlr86&div=4 |title = Judicial Accountability Must Safeguard, Not Threaten, Judicial Independence: An Introduction|journal = Denver University Law Review|volume = 86|pages = 1|last1 = O'Connor|first1 = Sandra Day}}</ref> On November 7, 2007, at a conference on her landmark opinion in ''[[Strickland v.

On August 7, 2008, O'Connor and [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], former [[President of Indonesia]], wrote an editorial in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' stating concerns about the threatened imprisonment of Malaysian opposition leader [[Anwar Ibrahim]].<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1a03116e-6484-11dd-af61-0000779fd18c.html "To defend Anwar is to defend Malaysian democracy"], Sandra Day O'Connor and Abdurrahman Wahid, ''Financial Times'', August 7, 2008.</ref>

Following the Court's ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'' decision on corporate political spending, O'Connor offered measured criticism of the decision, telling Georgetown law students and lawyers, "that the Court has created an unwelcome new path for wealthy interests to exert influence on judicial elections."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/oconnor-citizens-united-ruling-problem/story?id=9668044 |title=O'Connor Calls Citizens United Ruling A Problem |first=Matthew |last=Mosk |

O'Connor argued in favor of President [[Barack Obama]] naming the replacement for [[Antonin Scalia]] in February 2016, mere days after Scalia's death, opposing Republican arguments that the next president should get to fill the vacancy. She said, "I think we need somebody there to do the job now and let's get on with it"; and that "[y]ou just have to pick the best person you can under the circumstances, as the appointing authority must do. It's an important position and one that we care about as a nation and as a people. And I wish the president well as he makes choices and goes down that line. It's hard."<ref>{{cite news |first=Cristian | last=Farias |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sandra-day-oconnor-scalia_n_56c5313be4b0c3c55053c6d9 |title=Sandra Day O'Connor Says Obama Should Get To Replace Justice Scalia |work=[[HuffPost]] |date=February 17, 2016}}</ref>

Judge [[William H. Pryor Jr.]], a conservative jurist, has criticized O'Connor's speeches and op-eds for hyperbole and factual inaccuracy, based in part on O'Connor's opinions as to whether judges face a rougher time in the public eye today than in the past.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115992646659882019|title=Neither Force Nor Will, But Merely Judgment|last=Pryor Jr|first=William H.|date=October 4, 2006|work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2007/03/15/News/Judge.Pryor.On.Judicial.Independence-2777228.shtml |title=Judge Pryor on Judicial Independence |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927021204/http://media.www.hlrecord.org/media/storage/paper609/news/2007/03/15/News/Judge.Pryor.On.Judicial.Independence-2777228.shtml |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |work=[[Harvard Law Record]] |date=March 15, 2007 }}</ref>

O'Connor has reflected on her time on the Supreme Court by saying that she regrets the Court hearing the ''Bush v. Gore'' case in 2000 because it "stirred up the public" and "gave the Court a less-than-perfect reputation." The former justice told the ''Chicago Tribune'' that "Maybe the Court should have said, 'We're not going to take it, goodbye,' ... It turned out the election authorities in Florida hadn't done a real good job there and kind of messed it up. And probably the Supreme Court added to the problem at the end of the day."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-sandra-day-oconnor-edit-board-20130427,0,1201477.story|title=O'Connor questions court's decision to take Bush v.
