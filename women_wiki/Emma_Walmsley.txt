==Career==
Walmsley worked at [[L’Oréal]] for 17 years where she held a variety of general management and marketing roles in Paris, London and New York. From 2007 she was based in Shanghai as General Manager, Consumer Products for L’Oreal China, where she ran the company's Chinese consumer products business, overseeing global brands including L’Oréal Paris, [[Maybelline]] and [[Garnier]], as well as Mininurse, a Chinese skincare brand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://leanin.org/stories/emma-walmsley|title=Emma Walmsley|website=Lean In}}</ref> At the time of her move to GSK in 2010, ''Advertising Age'' quoted company insiders surprised at her departure from L’Oreal, where she had been tipped for a senior global management role.<ref name=guardian2016>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/20/emma-walmsley-profile-loreal-gsk-chief-designate-glaxosmithkline|title=Emma Walmsley profile: from marketing at L'Oréal to GSK chief|publisher=The Guardian|date=20 September 2016}}</ref>

She joined GlaxoSmithKline in May 2010 as President of Consumer Healthcare Europe, rising in October 2011 to head its global consumer healthcare division as President of Consumer Healthcare Worldwide and a member of the executive team.<ref>{{cite web|title=Executive Profile: Emma Walmsley|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=104803505&privcapId=275442|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> In March 2015 she became the Chief Executive Officer of Consumer Healthcare. Walmsley was particularly involved in leading the company's sales drive in emerging markets.<ref name=guardian2016 /> Under her leadership the consumer products division, one of the world's largest consumer health groups with brands including Panadol, Voltaren and Horlicks, made up nearly a quarter of GlaxoSmithKline's revenues.<ref name=bbc2016>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37416282|title=GlaxoSmithKline names Emma Walmsley as chief executive|date=20 September 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

She took over as CEO of the company in April 2017,<ref name=bbc2016 /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/glaxosmithkline-names-emma-walmsley-as-new-chief-executive-1474353563|title=GlaxoSmithKline Names Emma Walmsley as Next Chief Executive|first=Denise|last=Roland|date=20 September 2016|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}</ref> making her the first woman to run a major pharmaceutical company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/emma-walmsley/|title=Emma Walmsley|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en}}</ref> At the time, analysts commented that Walmsley's appointment could be seen as a signal that GSK would keep its consumer operation as a core part of its business.<ref name=bbc2016/>

In August 2017, Walmsley stated that her priority was for GlaxoSmithKline to become more adept at developing and commercialising new drugs. She announced a narrowed set of priorities for drug development, setting a target of allocating 80% of pharma R&D capital to a maximum of four disease areas. However, industry analysts noted that GlaxoSmithKline's decisions to hold its dividend would restrict the amount of cash available for R&D and acquiring intellectual property from other companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=GSK chief says her lack of ‘baggage’ in pharma is an advantag|url=https://www.ft.com/content/deec0e46-76bc-11e7-90c0-90a9d1bc9691|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref>

Walmsley has made much-needed changes, her most important move was "the transformation of the leadership team within R&D."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeanceo.com/profiles/prescription-for-success-emma-walmsley-leads-gsk-transformation/|title=Prescription for success: Emma Walmsley leads GSK transformation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>

In January 2018, it was reported that Walmsley had replaced 50 of [[GlaxoSmithKline]]'s top managers across the company's businesses, and created a number of new roles, including hiring Karenann Terrell from Walmart as chief digital and technology officer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fiercepharma.com/corporate/glaxosmithkline-ceo-reshuffles-40-management-team-bid-to-bring-new-ideas|title=GlaxoSmithKline CEO reshuffles 40% of management team in bid to bring in new ideas|website=FiercePharma}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=2018-01-09|title=Glaxo CEO Replaced 50 Top Managers in Shakeup to Spur Growth|language=en|work=Bloomberg.com|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-09/glaxo-ceo-has-replaced-50-top-managers-in-shakeup-to-spur-growth|access-date=2020-09-07}}</ref>

==Leadership style==

A ''Financial Times'' profile of Walmsley in September 2016 reported that colleagues describe her as a “strong and dynamic” leader who mixes a personable style with a “steely” focus. “She sets clear objectives and there's lots of KPIs [key performance indicators] to measure delivery,” said one. She pays close attention to talent development but “can be ruthless with underperformers”.<ref>{{cite web|title=Profile: Emma Walmsley, GSK’s new chief executive|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c7167916-7efe-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref>
