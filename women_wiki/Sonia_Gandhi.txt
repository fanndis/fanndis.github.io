'''Sonia Gandhi''' ({{audio|Sonia Gandhi1.ogg|pronunciation}}) ({{nee}} '''Maino'''; born 9 December 1946) is an Indian politician.  She is the president of the [[Indian National Congress]], the [[Centre-left politics|left-of-centre]] political party, which has governed India for most of its post-independence history. She took over as the party leader in 1998, seven years after the [[Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi|assassination of her husband, Rajiv Gandhi]], a former [[Prime Minister of India]], and remained in office for twenty-two years.{{efn|Sources.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/sonia-gandhi-congress-president-rahul-gandhi-politics-4983911/|title=Sonia Gandhi retires as Congress president, to remain active in politics|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=15 December 2017|access-date=15 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/as-sonia-gandhi-makes-way-4984673/

Born in a small village near [[Vicenza]], Italy, Gandhi was raised in a [[Roman Catholic]] family. After completing her primary education at local schools, she moved for language classes to [[Cambridge]], England, where she met [[Rajiv Gandhi]], and later married him in 1968. She then moved to India and started living with her mother-in-law, the then-[[Prime Minister of India]], [[Indira Gandhi]], at the latter's [[New Delhi]] residence. Sonia Gandhi, however, kept away from the [[public sphere]], even during the years of her husband's premiership.

Following her husband's assassination, Gandhi was invited by Congress leaders to lead the party, but she declined. She agreed to join politics in 1997 after much pleading from the party; the following year, she was nominated for [[List of Presidents of the Indian National Congress|party president]], and elected over [[Jitendra Prasada]].{{efn|Sources describing Gandhi's initial reluctance and eventual election.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/24/world/assassination-india-sonia-gandhi-declines-invitation-assume-husband-s-party-post.html|title=Assassination In India; Sonia Gandhi Declines Invitation To Assume Husband's Party Post|last=Weinraub|first=Bernard|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=24 May 1991|access-date=25 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/sonia-gandhi-re-elected-congress-president/301022|title=Sonia Gandhi re-elected Congress President|work=[[Outlook (Indian magazine)|Outlook]]|date=25 March 2005|access-date=21 November 2017}}</ref><ref name=elections.in>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.in/political-leaders/sonia-gandhi.html|title=Sonia Gandhi Biography|publisher=Elections in India|access-date=24 May 2014}}</ref>}} Under her leadership, the Congress went on to form the government post the [[2004 Indian general elections|2004 elections]] in coalition with other centre-left political parties. Gandhi has since been credited for being instrumental in formulating the [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA), which was re-elected to power in [[2009 Indian general elections|2009]]. Gandhi declined the premiership following the 2004 victory; she instead led the ruling alliance and the [[National Advisory Council]].{{efn|Sources describing Gandhi's leadership of the UPA and declining the premiership.<ref name="BBC Profile 2014">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Profile: Sonia Gandhi |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-26830531 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=16 May 2014 |access-date=21 May 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Fourth-time-in-a-row-Sonia-Gandhi-is-Congress-chief/articleshow/6487821.cms?referral=PM|title=Fourth time in a row, Sonia Gandhi is Congress chief|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=4 September 2010|access-date=25 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1652689_1652372_1652356,00.html|title=India's Most Influential|last=Robinson|first=Simon|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=25 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/2693501|title=Sonia: and yet so far|work=[[The Economist]]|date=20 May 2004|access-date=25 November 2017}}</ref>}}

Over the course of her career, Gandhi presided over the advisory councils credited for the formation and subsequent implementation of such [[rights-based approach to development|rights-based development and welfare schemes]] as the [[right to information]], [[Food security bill]], and [[MNREGA]], as she drew criticism related to the [[Bofors scandal]] and the [[National Herald Case|''National Herald'' Case]].

She stepped down as the Congress president in December 2017, but returned to lead the party in August 2019. Although she never held any [[List of office-holders in India|public office]] in the [[government of India]], Gandhi has been widely described as one of the most powerful politicians in the country, and is often listed among the most powerful women in the world.{{efn|Sources discussing the listing.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/india/the-sonia-gandhi-years-and-what-rahul-gandhi-can-learn/articleshow/61062696.cms|title=The Sonia Gandhi years and what Rahul Gandhi can learn|last=Manoj|first=CL|work=[[The Times of India]]|access-date=25 November 2017|date=13 October 2017}}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/sonia-gandhi-health-mystery-sets-india-leadership-adrift|title=Sonia Gandhi Health Mystery Sets India Leadership Adrift|last=Riedel|first=Bruce|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=25 November 2017|date=24 June 2012}}</ref><ref name="SandbrookGüven">{{cite book|author1=Richard Sandbrook|author2=Ali Burak Güven|title=Civilizing Globalization, Revised and Expanded Edition: A Survival Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=asKIAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA77|date=1 June 2014|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-5209-8|pages=77–}}</ref>}}

Gandhi completed her schooling at the age of 13; her final report card read: "intelligent, diligent, committed [...] would succeed well at the high school for teachers".

Sonia Gandhi's involvement with Indian public life began after the assassination of her mother-in-law and her husband's election as prime minister.

In 1984, she actively campaigned against her husband's sister-in-law [[Maneka Gandhi]] who was running against Rajiv in [[Amethi]].
