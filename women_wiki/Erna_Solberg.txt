Solberg was first elected to the [[Storting]] in 1989, and served as [[Minister of Local Government and Regional Development]] in [[Bondevik's Second Cabinet]] from 2001 to 2005. During her tenure she oversaw the tightening of [[immigration policy]] and the preparation of a proposed reform of the [[administrative divisions of Norway]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Erna Solberg |url=http://nbl.snl.no/Erna_Solberg |last1=Hellberg |first1=Lars |encyclopedia=Norsk biografisk leksikon |accessdate=May 23, 2014 |language=no}}</ref> After the [[2005 Norwegian parliamentary election|2005 election]], she chaired the Conservative Party parliamentary group until 2013.

After winning the [[2013 Norwegian parliamentary election|September 2013 election]], Solberg became the [[List of heads of government of Norway|28th]] [[prime minister of Norway]] and the second woman to hold the position, after [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]].<ref>PM 1981, 1986–1989, 1990–1996.</ref> [[Solberg's Cabinet]], often informally called the "Blue-Blue Cabinet", was initially a two-party minority government consisting of the Conservative and [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress]] parties.

Solberg had some struggles at school, and at the age of 16 was diagnosed as suffering from [[dyslexia]].

==Political career==
[[Image:Erna Solberg at party congress 2009.JPG|thumb|left|Erna Solberg during a party congress in 2009.]]

===Local government===
Solberg was a deputy member of [[Bergen]] city council in the periods 1979&ndash;1983 and 1987&ndash;1989, the last period on the executive committee. She chaired local and municipal chapters of the [[Norwegian Young Conservatives|Young Conservatives]] and the Conservative Party.

===Minister of Local Government and Regional Development===
From 2001 to 2005 Solberg served as the [[Minister of Local Government and Regional Development (Norway)|Minister of Local Government and Regional Development]] under Prime Minister [[Kjell Magne Bondevik]]. Her alleged tough policies in this department, including a firm stance on asylum policy, earned her the nickname "Jern-Erna" (Norwegian for "Iron Erna") in the [[News media|media]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Morken |first=Johannes |date=8 May 2009 |url=http://www.vl.no/samfunn/article9794.zrm |language=no |trans-title=Erna Solberg suggests tougher integration |newspaper=[[Vårt Land (Norwegian newspaper)|Vårt Land]] |accessdate=July 11, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630013226/http://www.vl.no/samfunn/article9794.zrm |title=Erna Solberg varsler tøffere integrering |archive-date=June 30, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - EPP Congress Warsaw (91).jpg|thumb|Solberg, [[José Manuel Barroso]] and [[Mariano Rajoy]] at [[European People's Party]] Congress in Warsaw in 2009]]

As Minister, Solberg instructed the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration to expel [[Mulla Krekar]], being a danger to national security. Later, terrorism charges were filed against Krekar for a death threat he uttered in 2010 against Erna Solberg.

===Party Leader===
She served as deputy leader of the Conservative Party from 2002 to 2004 and, in 2004, she became the party leader.

The Government was re-elected in [[2017 Norwegian parliamentary election|2017]], making Solberg the country's first conservative leader to win re-election since the 1980s.<ref name="veconomist" >{{cite news|title=Norway’s centre-right coalition is re-elected|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21728996-letting-populists-join-governments-can-be-good-way-defang-them-norways-centre-right-coalition|work=[[The Economist]]|date=14 September 2017}}</ref> The [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] parties were also able to maintain the majority in the [[Storting]].

Erna Solberg has combined numerous national positions as Minister, Parliamentarian and regional politician with a strong commitment to global solutions for development, growth and conflict resolution. <ref>https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/smk/organization-map/prime-minister-erna-solberg/id742859/</ref>

She also negotiated with the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberals]] to join the government in 2018. <ref> https://www.nrk.no/norge/venstre-sier-ja-til-a-ga-i-regjering-1.13865847</ref> The Liberals officially joined the Solberg Cabinet on 17 January 2018. After the [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democrats]] alliance conflict that lasted from September to November 2018, they eventually negotiated to join the Solberg Cabinet on the grounds of a minor change in the abortion law, something that caused harsh backlash from the public and critics alike. The Christian Democrats officially joined the Cabinet on 22 January 2019.<ref> https://www.nrk.no/nyheter/krfs-veivalg-1.12282551</ref>

===International engagements===

As Prime Minister, and former Chair of the Norwegian delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, she has championed transatlantic values and security.

In 2018 she assembled a global High Level Panel on sustainable ocean economy and introduced the topic at the G7 Summit. Her Government supports the World Bank's PROBLUE <ref>https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/problue</ref> initiative to prevent marine damage.

From 2016 the Prime Minister has co-chaired the UN Secretary General's Advocacy group for the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. Among the goals, she takes a particular interest in access to quality education for all, in particular girls and children in conflict areas. This was also central in her work as MDG Advocate from 2013 to 2016.

In one her many keynote speeches she stated that there is still a need for traditional aid and humanitarian assistance in marginalised and conflict-ridden areas of the world. The SDGs, however, take a holistic view of global development, and integrate economic, social and environmental factors.<ref>https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/keynote-speech---european-development-days/id2556225/</ref>

Solberg has shown particular interest in gender issues, such as girl's rights and education. Together with [[Graça_Machel|Graca Machel]] she has expressed the hope that in 2030 no factors such as poverty, gender and cultural beliefs will prevent any of today's ambitious young girls from standing confidently on the world stage <ref>http://news.trust.org/item/20160308130714-qh1w6/</ref>

In 2016 she held a lecture at the International Institute for Strategic Studies The Global Goals in Singapore, addressing a road map to a Sustainable, Fair and More Peaceful Futurethe International Institute for Strategic Studies<ref>https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/the-global-goals---a-roadmap-to-a-sustainable-fair-and-more-peaceful-future/id2483522/</ref>

Solberg has secured significant financial support for the Global Partnership for Education and hosted the Global Finance Facility for women's and children's health pledging Conference in Oslo in November 2018. Her firm belief is that investment in education will accelerate progress on all other SDG goals.

In April 2017 she held a speech on globalization and development at Peking University in Beijing <ref>https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/sustainable-development---making-globalisation-work-for-people-and-the-planet/id2549233/</ref>

She was awarded the inaugural Global Citizen World Leader Award in 2018 for her international engagement.<ref>https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/smk/organization-map/prime-minister-erna-solberg/id742859/</ref>

In Solberg's speech to the UN General Assembly in 2019 she advocated for Norway's candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for 2021–2022. She upheld that UN needs to be strengthened and that the world needs strong multilateral cooperation and institutions to tackle global challenges such as climate change, cyber security and terrorism <ref>https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/norways-statement-at-the-united-nations-general-assembly/id2670474/</ref>

In 2017, the [[Embassy of Russia in Oslo|Russian Embassy]] in Oslo had accused Norwegian officials and intelligence of using “false and disconnected [[Anti-Russian sentiment|anti-Russian rhetoric]]” and “scaring Norway’s population” about a "mythical Russian threat". In response, Prime Minister Solberg said: “This is an example of Russian propaganda that often comes when there’s a focus on security policy. There is nothing in this that’s new to us.”<ref>http://www.newsinenglish.no/2017/02/17/russian-embassy-in-oslo-calls-its-relations-with-norway-unsatisfactory/</ref>

Solberg has tried to maintain and improve the [[China–Norway relations]], which have been damaged since Norway decided to give the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] to [[Chinese dissident]] [[Liu Xiaobo]] in 2010. In response to his death, caused by organ failure while in government custody on 13 July 2017, Solberg said that "It is with deep grief that I received the news of Liu Xiaobo's passing.
