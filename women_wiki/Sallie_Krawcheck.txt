==Career==

===Sanford C. Bernstein===
Krawcheck started her business career as equity analyst covering the Wall Street firms, rising to become Director of Research and then chairman and CEO of sell-side research firm [[Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.]].<ref>[http://www.stpetersburgtimes.com/2002/10/31/Business/Citigroup_to_separate.shtml "Citigroup to separate units"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720151129/http://www.stpetersburgtimes.com/2002/10/31/Business/Citigroup_to_separate.shtml |date=2006-07-20 }}, ''St. Petersburg Times'' (Florida), October 31, 2002.</ref> She had a reputation for impartial advice and her decision to take Bernstein out of the lucrative, but conflicted underwriting business, caused ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' to dub her “The Last Honest Analyst.”<ref name="Fortune">{{cite magazine|url= https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/06/10/324541/index.htm|title= In Search Of The Last Honest Analyst Our quest wasn't easy.

===Citigroup===
Krawcheck was named [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Citigroup's (then new) [[Smith Barney]] unit, for which she was named to ''Time'''s 2002 list of "Global Influentials" and Fortune’s Most Influential Person Under the Age of 40.<ref name="time">Kadlec, Daniel, [http://www.time.com/time/2002/globalinfluentials/gbikrawcheck.html "2002 Global Influentials - Sallie Krawcheck"], ''Time''. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051223224233/http://www.time.com/time/2002/globalinfluentials/gbikrawcheck.html |date=2005-12-23 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-11-07/wall_street/30368617_1_sallie-krawcheck-bofa-wall-street|title= Did Sallie Krawcheck Just Hint That She Will Not Be Returning To Work On Wall Street?|author= Julia La Roche|date= November 7, 2011|website= [[Business Insider]]|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://archive.is/20130118184034/http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-11-07/wall_street/30368617_1_sallie-krawcheck-bofa-wall-street|archive-date= January 18, 2013}}</ref> The Smith Barney unit was set up in order to separate Citigroup's investment banking from its stock brokering and research operations, to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest in those areas. Krawcheck was put in charge of 13,000 brokers and analysts of the new retail brokerage unit.<ref name="USA Today">Iwata, Edward, [https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/banking/2002-10-30-sallie_x.htm "Citigroup's 'giant step forward'"], ''USA Today'', October 30, 2002.</ref>

In 2004, Krawcheck was appointed Chief Financial Officer for Citigroup Inc.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2895976/Rising-star-calls-Citigroup-to-account.html|title=Rising star calls Citigroup to account|last=English|first=Simon|date=2004-09-28|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

In 2007, Krawcheck was named CEO of Citi’s wealth management business, which included returning to Smith Barney and adding the Citi Private Bank. At the time of her arrival, the Private Bank had been thrown out of Japan for sales practice issues; this, combined with continuing Citi regulatory issues, resulted in financial advisor attrition that was at an all-time high. She worked to change the corporate culture for Smith Barney’s financial advisors as an early advocate of a fiduciary standard for the brokerage industry.<ref name="NYT Nov 08">{{cite news |title=When Citi Lost Sallie |author=Geraldine Fabricant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/business/16sallie.html?8dpc |work=The New York Times |date=15 November 2011 |accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.advisorone.com/2011/11/08/krawcheck-at-sifma-wall-st-must-change-its-culture|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109175029/http://www.advisorone.com/2011/11/08/krawcheck-at-sifma-wall-st-must-change-its-culture|archive-date=2011-11-09|title= Krawcheck at SIFMA: Wall St. Must Shift Its 'Culture of Crisis'  |author=Janet Levaux |date=November 8, 2011 |publisher= AdvisorOne |accessdate=2019-08-24}}</ref>

Krawcheck left Citi on September 22, 2008. The move followed months of tension with Chief Executive Officer [[Vikram Pandit]], due to the fact that Krawcheck argued for Citi to reimburse clients for defective investments distributed by Citi wealth management's brokers and bankers.<ref name="Reuters Sept 11">{{cite news |title=Krawcheck seen bidding final adieu to Wall Street |author=Jessica Toonkel, Ashley Lau |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/09/us-krawcheck-move-idUSTRE7887ES20110909 |agency=Reuters |date=9 September 2011 |accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref> Pandit and other chief officers at Citi disagreed, arguing that Citi had no legal obligation in the matter.<ref name="NYT Nov 08"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Behind Sallie Krawcheck's exit from Citi |author=Patricia Sellers |url=http://postcards.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/09/22/behind-sallie-krawchecks-exit-from-citi/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723022103/http://postcards.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/09/22/behind-sallie-krawchecks-exit-from-citi/ |archive-date=2011-07-23 |work=Fortune |date=22 September 2008 |accessdate=2019-08-24}}</ref>
