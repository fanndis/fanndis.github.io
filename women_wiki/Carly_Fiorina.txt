====Providing HP servers to the NSA====
In a September 2015 interview with [[Michael Isikoff]], Fiorina said that, in the weeks following the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]] in 2001, she received a phone call from [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]], then the [[director of the National Security Agency]], asking her assistance in providing HP computer servers to the NSA for expanded surveillance.<ref name="Isikoff">Michael Isikoff, [https://www.yahoo.com/politics/carly-fiorina-defends-bush-era-torture-and-spying-130015256041.html Carly Fiorina defends Bush-era torture and spying, calls for more transparency], Yahoo News (September 28, 2015).</ref> Hayden confirmed that he had made the request for HP servers as part of [[Stellar Wind]], a 2001–2007 [[NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07)|NSA warrantless surveillance program]], but the details were not revealed to Fiorina at the time.<ref name="Isikoff" /> Fiorina "acknowledged she complied with Hayden's request, redirecting trucks of HP computer servers that were on their way to retail stores from a warehouse in Tennessee to the [[Washington Beltway]], where they were escorted by NSA security" to the agency's [[Fort Meade]] headquarters. In 2015, Fiorina said: "I felt it was my duty to help, and so we did," adding, "They were ramping up a whole set of programs and needed a lot of data crunching capability to try and monitor a whole set of threats. ... What I knew at the time was our nation had been attacked."<ref name="Isikoff" /> Hayden also requested that Fiorina provide advice to the agency "on how the CIA could maintain its undercover espionage mission in a culture of increasing government leaks and demands for greater public accountability and openness." According to Fiorina, she advised the agency to be "as transparent as possible, about as much as possible".<ref name="Isikoff" />

====Changes to HP culture====
Fiorina's predecessor at HP had pushed for an outsider to replace him because he believed that the company had become complacent and that consensus-driven decision making was inhibiting the company's growth.  Fiorina instituted three major changes shortly after her arrival: replacing [[profit sharing]] with bonuses awarded if the company met financial expectations, a reduction in operating units from 83 to 12, and  consolidating back-office functions.<ref name=stanford>{{cite web|title=Leadership Challenges at Hewlett-Packard: Through the looking Glass|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/publication-pdf/cgri-closer-look-21-hp-leadership-challenges.pdf|publisher=Stanford Graduate School of Business|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref>

Fiorina faced a backlash among HP employees and the tech community for her leading role in the demise of HP's egalitarian "[[Hewlett-Packard#Staff and culture|The HP Way]]" work culture and guiding philosophy,<ref name="johnson" /><ref name="heritage1" /><ref name="paloaltoonline">{{cite web |url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/2002/2002_04_10.hpway10.html |title=The rise and fall of the HP Way (April 10, 2002) |publisher=paloaltoonline.com}}</ref> which she felt hindered innovation.<ref name="johnson"/><ref name="reutershpway">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/08/09/us-hp-theway-idUSTRE6781EN20100809|title=Fiorina, Hurd: no practitioners of The HP Way?|agency=Reuters | date=August 9, 2010}}</ref> Because of changes to HP's culture, and requests for voluntary pay cuts to prevent layoffs (subsequently followed by the largest layoffs in HP's history), employee satisfaction surveys at HP—previously among the highest in America—revealed "widespread unhappiness" and distrust,<ref name="johnson" /><ref name="elsbach">{{cite journal| last1 = Elsbach | first1 = Kimberly | last2 = Stigliani | first2 = Ileana | last3 = Stroud | first3 = Amy |title = The building of employee distrust: a case study of Hewlett-Packard from 1995 to 2010 | journal = Organizational Dynamics | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 254–263 | publisher = Elsevier | date = July–September 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.orgdyn.2012.03.003| url = https://escholarship.org/content/qt5pr310kf/qt5pr310kf.pdf?t=pudeey }}</ref> and Fiorina was sometimes booed at company meetings and attacked on HP's [[electronic bulletin board]].<ref name="johnson" />

According to ''[[The Fiscal Times]]'', Fiorina and others have argued that she "laid the groundwork for some of HP's progress under her successors", and that she shook the culture at HP so that it could compete in the Internet Age.<ref name=fiscaltimes>{{cite web|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Yuval|title=Carly Fiorina's Real Record at HP: Is She Presidential Material?|url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/05/Carly-Fiorina-s-Real-Record-HP-She-Presidential-Material|work=The Fiscal Times|accessdate=August 22, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822235734/http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/05/Carly-Fiorina-s-Real-Record-HP-She-Presidential-Material|archive-date=August 22, 2015|date=May 5, 2015}}</ref>

====iPod+HP====
{{Main|iPod+HP}}
In January 2004, Fiorina announced an agreement with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] founder [[Steve Jobs]] for the [[iPod+HP]]—a [[Co-branding|co-branded]] [[iPod]] sold through HP's retail channels.<ref>Steven Levy, ''The Perfect Thing: How the iPod Shuffles Commerce, Culture, and Coolness'' (Simon & Schuster: 2006), pp. 98–99.</ref> As part of the agreement, HP was forbidden from selling a competitor to the iPod until August 2006 and HP agreed to pre-install [[iTunes]] on every computer sold.<ref name=":1" /> Two days before Fiorina announced the HP+iPod, Jobs announced a new product, the [[iPod mini]], catching Fiorina off guard.<ref>Charles Arthur, ''Digital Wars: Apple, Google, Microsoft and the Battle for the Internet'' (2d ed.: Kogan Page, 2014), p. 122.</ref> HP did not sell the newer versions of the iPod in a timely fashion, leaving them to sell an outdated device for several months.

In other words, the number of employees barely budged from the pre-merger total–and people lost jobs as a result.  The ''Los Angeles Times'', evaluating Fiorina's record when she ran for the Senate in 2010, noted that during her tenure HP also acquired more than a dozen other companies with at least 8,000 employees.
