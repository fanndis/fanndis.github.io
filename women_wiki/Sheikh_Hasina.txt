==Background and early life==
{{See also|Sheikh–Wazed family|15 August 1975 Bangladesh coup d'état}}
Sheikh Hasina was born in [[Tungipara]], [[East Pakistan]] on 28 September 1947. Her father was [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], the 'father' of the Bengali Nation, and the first President of Bangladesh. Her mother was [[Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Sheikh-Hasina-Wazed |title=Sheikh Hasina Wazed |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=28 March 2016}}</ref> She has said in many interviews that she had grown up in fear due to her father's political works.<ref name=":4" /> She married physicist [[M.

Hasina was not in Bangladesh when her father, and most of her family, were [[Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|assassinated on 15 August 1975]] during a military [[coup d'état]] by members of the [[Bangladesh Army]]. She was in West Germany where her husband, M. A. Wazed Miah, was working as a [[nuclear physicist]]. She moved to [[Delhi]] in late 1975 and was provided asylum by India. Her son, [[Sajeeb Wazed Joy]], studied at Indian boarding schools. During her time in India Hasina was not involved in politics, but became close friends with [[Suvra Mukherjee]], wife of the future Indian President [[Pranab Mukherjee]].<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2010/01/11/hasina-revisits-delhi-her-home-from-1975-81 |title=Hasina revisits Delhi, her home from 1975-81 |work=bdnews24.com |access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>

Hasina was not allowed to return to Pakistan until after she was elected to lead the Awami League Party on 16 February 1981, and arrived home on 17 May 1981.<ref name=":4">{{cite news |date=23 September 2013 |title=Sheikh Hasina: They 'should be punished' |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/frostinterview/2013/09/2013920103532114976.html |work=Al Jazeera}}</ref> She is the aunt of British MP [[Tulip Siddiq]].<ref name="sylhettimesdigital">{{cite news |url=http://sylhettimesdigital.co.uk/miliband-praises-young-british-bangladeshi-labour-hopefuls/ |title=Miliband praises young British Bangladeshi Labour hopefuls |work=The Sylhet Times |date=20 January 2010 |access-date=18 September 2011}}</ref><ref name="aljazeera">{{cite news |last=Neild |first=Barry |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/01/uk-vote-could-create-cross-border-dynasty-2014113112342206325.html |title=UK vote could create cross-border dynasty |location=Qatar |work=Al Jazeera |date=15 January 2014 |access-date=19 March 2014}}</ref>

==Early political career==

=== 1981–1991: Movement against military rule ===
While living in self-exile in India, Hasina was elected President of the Bangladesh Awami League (AL) in 1981.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/sheikh-hasina-wajed/ |title=Sheikh Hasina Wajed |website=Forbes |access-date=28 March 2016}}</ref> The AL has been described as a "[[Centre-left politics|left-of-center]]" party.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://daily-sun.com/printversion/details/257850 |title=SHEIKH HASINA : THE Modern Day Joan Of Arc |work=Daily Sun |access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2005455_2005458_2005459,00.html |title=Top Female Leaders Around the World |last=Adams |first=William Lee |date=16 September 2011 |newspaper=Time |issn=0040-781X |access-date=28 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aceproject.org/ace-en/focus/focus-on-effective-electoral-assistance/a-bangladesh-case-study-technical-electoral/mobile_browsing/onePag |title=ACE |website=aceproject.org |access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref>

Under martial law, Hasina was in and out of detention throughout the 1980s. In 1984, she was put under [[house arrest]] in February and again in November. In March 1985, she was put under house arrest for another three months.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://awpc.cattcenter.iastate.edu/directory/sheikh-hasina/ |title=Sheikh Hasina - |website=Archives of Women's Political Communication  |access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://btrc.gov.bd/bn/node/3581 |title=Sheikh Hasina {{!}} বিটিআরসি |website=BTRC |access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref> Her party, along with the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) under [[Khaleda Zia]], continued to work to restore democratically elected government, which they achieved by the democratic election in 1991, won by the BNP.

Hasina and AL participated in the [[1986 Bangladeshi general election]] held under President [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]]. She served as the leader of the [[Parliamentary Opposition]] in 1986–1987.<ref name=":0" /> She led an eight-party alliance as opposition against Ershad.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/29/world/bangladesh-storms-kill-200-in-week-3000-are-missing.html |title=Bangladesh Storms Kill 200 in Week; 3,000 Are Missing |last=Ap |date=29 August 1987 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2019-02-08 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Hasina's decision to take part in the election had been criticised by her opponents, since the election was held under martial law, and the other main opposition group boycotted the poll. However, her supporters maintained that she used the platform effectively to challenge Ershad's rule. Ershad dissolved the parliament in December 1987 when Hasina and her Awami League resigned in an attempt to call for a fresh general election to be held under a neutral government. During November and December in 1987, a mass uprising happened in Dhaka and several people were killed, including [[Noor Hossain]], a Hasina supporter.

===1991–1996: Transition to democracy and Leader of the opposition===
After several years of [[autocratic rule]], widespread protests and strikes had paralysed the economy. Government officers refused to follow orders and resigned. Members of the [[Bangladesh Rifles]] laid down their weapons instead of firing on protestors and curfew was openly violated. Hasina worked with Khaleda Zia in organizing opposition to Ershad.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/09/world/revolution-brings-bangladesh-hope.html |title=Revolution Brings Bangladesh Hope |last1=Crossette |first1=Barbara |date=9 December 1990 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2019-02-08 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> A huge mass protest in December 1990 ousted Ershad from power when he resigned in favour of his vice president, Justice [[Shahabuddin Ahmed]], the Chief Justice of the [[Bangladesh Supreme Court]]. The [[caretaker government]], headed by Ahmed, administered a general election for the parliament. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by Khaleda Zia won a general majority, and Hasina's Awami League emerged as the largest opposition party.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1575704.stm |title=Analysis: A tale of two women |date=2 October 2001 |work=BBC News |access-date=28 March 2016}}</ref> Among three constituencies Hasina fought, she lost in two and won in one. Accepting election defeat, She offered her resignation as the party president but stayed on at the request of party leaders.

Politics in Bangladesh took a decisive turn in 1994, after a [[by-election]]  in [[Magura District|Magura]],  held after the death of the MP for that constituency, a member of Hasina's party. The Awami League had expected to win back the seat, but the BNP candidate won through rigging and manipulation, according to the neutral observer who came to witness the election.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/magura-polls-then-and-now-19000 |title=Magura: Polls then and now |date=7 April 2014 |newspaper=The Daily Star |access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref> Hasina led the Bangladesh Awami League in boycotting the parliament from 1994.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/01/14/world/bangladesh-facing-an-election-crisis.html |title=Bangladesh Facing an Election Crisis |last=Burns |first=John F. |date=14 January 1996 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2019-02-08 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==1996–2001: First premiership==

The [[Awami League]] (AL), with other opposition parties, demanded that the next general elections be held under a neutral caretaker government, and that provision for caretaker governments to manage elections be incorporated in the constitution. The ruling [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) refused to act on these demands.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Haidar|first=Suhasini|date=17 October 2020|title=Before his pen went dry, Pranab Mukherjee wrote on 1971, love for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman family|language=en-IN|work=[[The Hindu]]|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/book-on-mujibur-rahman-will-have-the-last-essay-penned-by-pranab-mukherjee/article32880610.ece|url-status=live|access-date=2020-11-07|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>

Opposition parties launched an unprecedented campaign, calling strikes for weeks on end. The Government accused them of destroying the economy while the opposition countered that BNP could solve this problem by acceding to their demands. In late 1995, the MPs of AL and other parties resigned from parliament. Parliament completed its term and the 15 [[February 1996 Bangladeshi general election]] was held. The election was boycotted by all major parties except the ruling BNP, who won all the seats in the parliament as a result. Hasina described the election as a farce.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://bdaffairs.com/bangladeshi-general-election-february-1996/ |title=Bangladeshi General Election, February 1996 |website=Bangladesh Affairs |access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-69196 |title=Past elections at a glance |date=29 December 2008 |work=The Daily Star |access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>

The new Parliament, composed mostly of BNP members, amended the constitution to create provisions for a caretaker government (CTG). The 30 [[June 1996 Bangladeshi general election]]s were held under a neutral caretaker government headed by retired Chief Justice [[Muhammad Habibur Rahman]]. AL won the largest number of seats, 146, but fell short of the majority. Khaleda Zia, leader of the BNP who won 104 seats, denounced the results and alleged [[vote rigging]]. This was in contrast to what the neutral observers said, that the election was free and fair.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/world/after-21-years-bangladeshi-party-is-returned-to-power.html |title=After 21 Years, Bangladeshi Party Is Returned to Power |last=Burns |first=John F. |date=14 June 1996 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2019-02-08 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Hasina served her first term as Prime Minister (PM) of Bangladesh from 1996 to 2001. She became the first Bangladeshi PM since its independence to complete the entire term.<ref name=":0" /> She signed the 30-year water-sharing treaty of the Ganges with India. Her administration repealed the [[Indemnity Act, Bangladesh|Indemnity Act]], which protected the killers of Sheikh Mujib, her father and first President of Bangladesh. Her government opened the telecom industry, which till then was limited to government-owned companies, to the private sector. In 1999 the government started the New Industrial Policy (NIP) which aimed to strengthen the private industry and encourage growth.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Hasina,_Sheikh |title=Hasina, Sheikh - Banglapedia |website=en.banglapedia.org |access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref>

Bangladesh joined two multilateral bodies, [[Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation]] (BIMSTEC) and [[D-8 Organization for Economic Cooperation]] (D-8). The NIP allowed foreign companies to open 100 percent owned subsidiaries.<ref name=":3" />

In the [[2001 Bangladeshi general election]], although winning 40% of the popular vote (slightly less than BNP's 41%), AL won just 62 seats in the Parliament, while the 'Four Party Alliance' led by BNP won 234 seats, giving them a two-thirds majority in Parliament. Hasina herself ran in three constituencies,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sheikh Hasina's party wins Bangladesh election; opposition claims votes rigged|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/top-story/prime-minister-sheikh-hasina-wins-bangladesh-election--opposition-claims-votes-rigged/story/305449.html|access-date=2020-11-07|website=www.businesstoday.in}}</ref> and was defeated in a constituency in [[Rangpur District|Rangpur]], which included her husband's home town, but won in two other seats. Hasina and AL rejected the results, claiming that the election was rigged with the help of the President and the caretaker government. The international community was largely satisfied with the elections, and the 'Four Party Alliance' went on to form the government.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Matin|first=Abdul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2GSgAAAAMAAJ|title=Sheikh Hasina: The Making of a Prime Minister|date=1997|publisher=Radical Asia Publications|isbn=978-0-907546-27-6|location=|pages=214|language=en}}</ref>

== 2001–2008: Opposition period ==
The Awami League MPs were irregular in attending the Parliament during the following period.<ref>{{Cite news |date=21 August 2017|title=Assassination Attempt on Hasina: Ten Huji men get death by shooting|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/assassination-attempt-hasina-ten-huji-men-get-death-shooting-1451581|access-date=2020-11-07|work=The Daily Star|language=en}}</ref>  In late 2003, the Awami League started its first major anti-government movement, culminating in the declaration by party general secretary [[Abdul Jolil (Bangladesh politician)|Abdul Jolil]] that the government would fall before 30 April 2004. This failed to happen and was seen as a blow to the party and Hasina, who had implicitly supported Jalil.

===2004: Assassination attempt===
{{see also|2004 Dhaka grenade attack}}
During her second term as leader of the opposition, political unrest and violence increased. MP [[Ahsanullah Master]] died after he was shot in May 2004. This was followed by a [[2004 Dhaka grenade attack|grenade attack on 21 August]] on an Awami League gathering in Dhaka, resulting in the death of 24 party supporters, including [[Ivy Rahman]], party women's secretary. On 10&nbsp;October 2018, a special court gave verdicts in two cases filed over the incident; the court ruled that it was a well-orchestrated plan, executed through abuse of state power, and all the accused, including BNP Senior vice-chairman [[Tarique Rahman]] ([[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]) and former top intelligence officials, were found guilty.

== Controversies ==
The [[Padma Bridge graft scandal]] was a political incident in Bangladesh that involved the ruling [[Bangladesh Awami League]]'s government who allegedly sought, in exchange for the awarding of the construction contract, large amount of money from the Canadian construction company [[SNC-Lavalin]]. The allegations were subsequently found to be false and without merit, and the Canadian Court subsequently dismissed the case.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/world/north-america/canada-court-finds-no-proof-padma-bridge-graft-conspiracy-1359397 |title=Canada court finds no proof of Padma bridge bribery conspiracy |work=The Daily Star |date=11 February 2017}}</ref>

As a result of the allegations, [[The World Bank]] pulled out of a project to build Bangladesh's largest bridge, citing corruption concerns, cancelling $1.2bn (£764m) credit for the 6&nbsp;km-long (four miles) road-rail bridge over the [[Padma River]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-18655846 |title=World Bank cancels Bangladesh bridge loan over corruption |date=30 June 2012 |work=BBC News |access-date=31 December 2016}}</ref> Hasina removed the Communication Minister [[Syed Abul Hossain]] from office three months after dismissal of the case.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2012/02/strange-bedfellows-bangladesh |title=Bridge-mending |date=27 February 2012 |newspaper=The Economist |access-date=6 February 2017 |issn=0013-0613}}</ref> On 11 July 2012, [[Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir]] said the Awami League government should make public a letter sent by the World Bank, wherein the Bank brought graft charges against Hasina and three other figures.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://print.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/old/more.php?news_id=136204&date=2012-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207112707/http://print.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/old/more.php?news_id=136204&date=2012-07-11 |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 February 2017 |title=PM among 3 charged with graft by WB : Fakhrul |last=Ahmed |first=Hafez |work=The Financial Express |location=Dhaka |access-date=6 February 2017}}</ref> On 17 January 2016, Sheikh Hasina stated that an MD of a bank from the USA provoked the WB to cancel the loan.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/city/banks-md-provoked-wb-scrap-padma-bridge-funding-202999 |title=A bank's MD provoked WB to scrap Padma Bridge funding |date=17 January 2016 |newspaper=The Daily Star |access-date=6 February 2017}}</ref>
